      <description>Alaska is now the first state to allow those 16-and-older access to a COVID-19 vaccine. Most other states have provided vaccination access to seniors, and those with pre-existing conditions as well as front-line workers. The only vaccine with emergency use authorization for those as young as 16 is the Pfizer vaccine. Other vaccines like Moderna are testing the vaccine on those 12 and older. No vaccines studies (from Western nations) are currently being conducted with those under the age of 12 though this could change if the studies on those 12-and-older are successful.</description>

      <description>Washington‚Äôs Farewell Address
https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Washingtons_Farewell_Address.htm Every year since 1896, the Senate has observed Washington‚Äôs Birthday by selecting one of its members to read the 7,641-word statement in legislative session; parties alternate each year. Delivery generally takes about 45 minutes. In 1985, Florida senator Paula Hawkins tore through the text in a record-setting 39 minutes ‚Äì while in 1962 West Virginia senator Jennings Randolph, savoring each word, consumed 68 minutes. At the conclusion of each reading, the appointed senator inscribes his or her name and brief remarks in a black, leather-bound book maintained by the Secretary of the Senate.</description>

      <description>Fun fact ‚Äì My dad use to play in the NFL! During his days in the league, he played in 3 Super Bowls as a punter, and quarterback. This all happened in the years before I was born so I never experienced this part of his life with him, but we always watched football together and he would tell us stories about his years playing in the National Football League.</description>

      <description>It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp‚Äùst thou me?
The Bridegroom‚Äùs doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May‚Äùst hear the merry din.
He holds him with his skinny hand,
There was a ship, quoth he.
Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.</description>

      <description>I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him.</description>

      <description>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

I had no idea I‚Äùd be living down the road from where we walked down the aisle right outside of Austin Texas. It‚Äùs funny the twists and turns of life, isn‚Äùt it?</description>

      <description>Update from Prince Harry‚Äôs Communications team (Photo credits: @KensingtonRoyal)
https://www.royal.uk/update-communications-secretary-prince-harry-wedding-prince-harry-and-ms-markle Why Prince Harry &amp;amp; Megan Markle Plan to Delay Their Honeymoon:
https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20151413/prince-harry-meghan-markle-delay-honeymoon/
If that wasn‚Äôt enough, Kensington Palace is also confirming that Harry and Meghan will not be going on their honeymoon, which will reportedly be at a luxury tented camp in Namibia, as quickly as most couple‚Äôs head off. Traditionally, newlyweds honeymoon almost immediately after a fabulous send-off after their wedding‚Äôs evening reception, but Harry and Meghan have their first official engagement as a married couple just days after their nuptials.</description>

      <description>SmartHER Take: The so-called ‚ÄúWaffle House‚Äù shooting is the second mass shooting in 2018 where the shooter was KNOWN to law enforcement; the alleged high school shooter in Parkland Florida was also known to local police before his murderous rampage and reported to the FBI through a tipline. We will continue to investigate what led to the identification of these threatening would-be criminals but the inability to stop a horrendous crime.</description>

There is a critical amount of social support behind the institutions and armed movements of the axis‚Äîmany of its combatants are willing to fight and die for their cause.

      <description>SmartHer Context: Remember the President asked for $25B for a border wall in the recent spending bill. Congress allocated $1.6B for a limit fence‚Ä¶NOT a wall. Building a wall and border security remains front and center of President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù agenda. This is one way to continue his mission without needing Congressional approval. At least for now.

      <description>An Update on Our Plans to Restrict Data Access on Facebook: https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/ Still, given the public‚Äùs lack of understanding of APIs and platforms, it may be tough for Facebook to ever regain the trust broken by a month of savage headlines about the social network‚Äùs privacy negligence. Long-term, this souring of opinion could make users hesitant to share as much on Facebook. But given its role as a ubiquitous utility for login with your identity across the web, our compulsive desire to scroll its feed and check its notifications, and the lack of viable social networking alternatives, Facebook might see the backlash blow over eventually.</description>

There‚Äôs certainly fear among marketers to even seem controversial.

Democrats have called the memo a cherry-picked list of GOP talking points that attempts to distract from the committee‚Äùs own investigation into Russian meddling in the election that sent Trump to the White House. They have prepared their own memo in response, but Republicans voted to block its immediate public release.
The drama comes as special counsel Robert Mueller also is investigating whether the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia during the campaign and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry by, among other actions, firing Comey.</description>

Most people with influenza are being infected with the H3N2 influenza virus. And in seasons where H3N2 is the main cause of influenza, we see more cases, more visits to the doctor, more hospitalizations, and more deaths, especially among older people.</description>

      <description>What is real news? What does it mean to truly empower women? Confronting these two questions led to the creation of SmartHER news.
In 2004, I scrapped together enough money (and loans) to move from my hometown of San Francisco to New York City to pursue my dream of becoming a journalist. I attended Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Graduate School of Journalism and spent more than a decade as a working journalist in New York City as a writer, producer, reporter and most recently over the last 7 years as a national news anchor for the Fox News Channel.</description>
