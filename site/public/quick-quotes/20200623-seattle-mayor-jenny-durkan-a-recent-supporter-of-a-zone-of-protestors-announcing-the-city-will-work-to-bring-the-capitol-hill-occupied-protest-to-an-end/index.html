<ul>
<li>The announcement comes after two shootings this weekend, that led to at least one death. Police were unable to help the shooting victims Saturday night after determining the crowd was too “violent.” <a href="https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2020/06/20/homicide-investigation-inside-protest-area/">WATCH</a></li>
<li>Durkan says she supports the peaceful protests during the day but has increasing concern about the violence at night. <a href="https://apnews.com/4dcff8f062bae9e1fe3885c346b44847">READ MORE</a></li>
<li><strong>WHY IT MATTERS:</strong> The protest zone has now inspired another “occupied” area right across the street from the White House. While Mayor Durkan has supported the protestors, questions continue about how exactly the government will “wind down” these protests, especially since its been reported that some of those in this area are armed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s some background on how this “zone” came to be:</p>
<p>NOTE: On June 15, protesters in the CHAZ (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone) changed the name of the area to the CHOP (Capitol Hill Organized Protest)</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT UNFOLDED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>June 8: After eight days of clashes with protesters following the May 25 death of George Floyd., the East Precinct police left the area in front of the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct in Capitol Hill, boarded up the building and allowed protesters to freely march</li>
<li>June 9: Protesters put up a sign on the East Precinct in Capitol Hill reads: “This space is now property of the Seattle people.”<br>
Mayor Durkan tweeted “in an effort to proactively de-escalate interactions between protesters and law enforcement outside the East Precinct, Chief Best and @SeattlePD officers have removed barricades surrounding the East Precinct while safely securing the facility.”</li>
<li>June 11: After the Seattle Police Chief Best said the decision to closed the police department’s East Precinct was not hers and the result of the city caving to “severe public pressure”, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan released a statement saying it was her decision to remove the barriers around the East Precinct.<br>
LAWLESS?</li>
<li>Since June 9, city staff, including representatives from the Mayor’s Office, have been meeting daily with CHAZ/CHOP leaders to work with the organizers on sanitation, hygiene, and any other needs</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the city, the Seattle Police Department will dispatch to respond to significant life-safety issues in the area, including active shooters, assaults, fires, and medical emergencies. Police will also help facilitate the Seattle Fire Department’s safe response to significant medical incidents.</p>
<p>Mayor Durkan has consistently countered Trump’s threats to send in the US military.<br>
On June 11, Mayor Durkan tweeted ‘The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone #CHAZ is not a lawless wasteland of anarchist insurrection – it is a peaceful expression of our community’s collective grief and their desire to build a better world. Given his track record, it’s not hard to believe that Trump is wrong, yet again.”</p>
<p><strong>WHAT PROTESTERS WANT:</strong><br>
The main purpose of CHOP, activists say, is to occupy the space in order to imagine, debate, and experiment with a radically different relationship between police and community.<br>
In recent days, protesters have called for CHOP to become a community center.<br>
Mayor Durkan has been mostly supportive protesters’ demands EXCEPT for efforts to de-fund the police.</p>
<p>Seattle has moved rapidly to meet some of the demands…</p>
<ul>
<li>On June 3, Mayor Durkan ended the city curfew.</li>
<li>On June 10, Mayor Durkan signed an executive order requiring police to active cameras at demonstrations</li>
<li>On June 11, Mayor Durkan committed to investing $100 million new dollars in community-based programs that serve Black and indigenous people, and</li>
<li>communities of color</li>
<li>On June 12, judge prohibited the use of chemicals or projectiles against peaceful protesters i</li>
<li>On June 15, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to ban police from using chokeholds, tear gas, pepper spray and several other crowd control device</li>
<li>Over the weekend June 20-21, 2 shootings occurred in the protest zone. One was of a 19-year-old man, Lorenzo Anderson, who later died. His godmother, speaking at the site of the autonomous zone, said in the wake of his death: “You just messed up your whole movement because you should’ve sat up here and been protecting him. You guys let a black life go in your so-called ‘Black Lives Matter’ protest on the street. Come on now.”</li>
<li>June 22: The Seattle mayor announced police will move back into their abandoned precinct: “It’s time for people to go home, it is time for us to restore Cal Anderson and Capitol Hill so it can be a vibrant part of the community. The impacts on the businesses and residents and the community are now too much.” <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-police-will-return-to-east-precinct-where-chop-has-reigned-durkan-says/">READ MORE</a></li>
