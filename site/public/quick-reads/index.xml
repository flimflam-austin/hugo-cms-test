      <description>Washington’s Farewell Address
https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Washingtons_Farewell_Address.htm Every year since 1896, the Senate has observed Washington’s Birthday by selecting one of its members to read the 7,641-word statement in legislative session; parties alternate each year. Delivery generally takes about 45 minutes. In 1985, Florida senator Paula Hawkins tore through the text in a record-setting 39 minutes – while in 1962 West Virginia senator Jennings Randolph, savoring each word, consumed 68 minutes. At the conclusion of each reading, the appointed senator inscribes his or her name and brief remarks in a black, leather-bound book maintained by the Secretary of the Senate.</description>

      <description>SmartHER FYI: We’ve seen the date of the arrival of the Statue of Liberty also attributed to June 17, 1885. We are following the history according to the Library of Congress, though some sites, including the official site of the Statue of Liberty, leaves the exact date vague and says generically, June 1885.

If you are planning on going to the game, make sure to keep the weather in mind. Winters in South Bend can be downright brutal. In December, the average high is 34 degrees or so. September and October are my favorite times of the year to have perfect, Fall football weather.</description>

Hey Guys!
Happy July 4th!
And a very happy anniversary to my husband, Leif Babin. We married July 4th weekend, 2011. I think back to that time now and shake my head. I had no idea I”d be living down the road from where we walked down the aisle right outside of Austin Texas. It”s funny the twists and turns of life, isn”t it?</description>

After then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor”s 2014 defeat in a Republican primary in Virginia, some predicted a tidal wave of anti-incumbent sentiment that would reshape the Republican Party.

T_hat doesn”t mean that such secular approaches—and schools—don”t have their place. Of course they do. And so do character education, ethics classes, and civics, all of which can contribute to the development of self-discipline.

_That said, our results suggest that Catholic schools in particular are doing something meaningful in the realm of self-discipline.</description>

David Eisenhower later clarified its meaning, writing in 1964 that “any amphibious operation has a departed date; therefore, the shortened term D-Day is used.”
That’s why military historians will tell you the Normandy invasion was just one of several D-Days of World War II. Every amphibious assault – including those in the Pacific, North Africa, Sicily and Italy- had its own D-Day, the Army said.</description>

      <description>Update from Prince Harry’s Communications team (Photo credits: @KensingtonRoyal)
https://www.royal.uk/update-communications-secretary-prince-harry-wedding-prince-harry-and-ms-markle Why Prince Harry &amp;amp; Megan Markle Plan to Delay Their Honeymoon:
https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20151413/prince-harry-meghan-markle-delay-honeymoon/
If that wasn’t enough, Kensington Palace is also confirming that Harry and Meghan will not be going on their honeymoon, which will reportedly be at a luxury tented camp in Namibia, as quickly as most couple’s head off. Traditionally, newlyweds honeymoon almost immediately after a fabulous send-off after their wedding’s evening reception, but Harry and Meghan have their first official engagement as a married couple just days after their nuptials.</description>

      <description>SmartHER Take: The so-called “Waffle House” shooting is the second mass shooting in 2018 where the shooter was KNOWN to law enforcement; the alleged high school shooter in Parkland Florida was also known to local police before his murderous rampage and reported to the FBI through a tipline. We will continue to investigate what led to the identification of these threatening would-be criminals but the inability to stop a horrendous crime.</description>

      <description>Why Russia is an ally of Assad: https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/09/economist-explains-22 Beware Iran’s ‘Axis ofA Resistance: https://www.usnews.com/opinion/world-report/articles/2018-02-23/irans-axis-of-resistance-is-a-direct-threat-to-the-us Iran’s Axis of Resistance Rises: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2017-01-24/irans-axis-resistance-rises  At this point, dismantling the axis of resistance would be unfeasible. The clock cannot be turned back. There is a critical amount of social support behind the institutions and armed movements of the axis—many of its combatants are willing to fight and die for their cause. Without recognizing the changing facts on the ground and the means for credible engagement, applying greater pressure on Iran and the axis will yield marginal gains given they have thrived under decades of war or warlike conditions.</description>

      <description>**Patrick Reed wins Masters for first major title:**A http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/23081962/patrick-reed-wins-masters-first-major-title Why Patrick Reed and Rory McIlroy Are Both Wearing Pink at the Masters
The golfers in the final group will be in the same color as part of a coordinated effort by NikeA So it”s not a coincidence when you see both of the golfers in the final group in the same color. Rory McIlroy, who surged Saturday with a 65 to put him 11 under, will also be in a shirt that”s pink—or hyper magenta, according to Golf Week.</description>

      <description>SmartHer Context: Remember the President asked for $25B for a border wall in the recent spending bill. Congress allocated $1.6B for a limit fence…NOT a wall. Building a wall and border security remains front and center of President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. This is one way to continue his mission without needing Congressional approval. At least for now.

      <description>An Update on Our Plans to Restrict Data Access on Facebook: https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/ Still, given the public”s lack of understanding of APIs and platforms, it may be tough for Facebook to ever regain the trust broken by a month of savage headlines about the social network”s privacy negligence. Long-term, this souring of opinion could make users hesitant to share as much on Facebook. But given its role as a ubiquitous utility for login with your identity across the web, our compulsive desire to scroll its feed and check its notifications, and the lack of viable social networking alternatives, Facebook might see the backlash blow over eventually.</description>

      <description>Important: Context for this study isn’t available – It’s the first of its kind: “..this was the beginning of the surveillance and so it”s just the first nine months. I can tell you that I was surprised by the numbers that we found. This was more than I was expecting. But it”s the beginning of looking. We hope though that this won”t be an inevitable march upward, but that by finding them early when there”s only one in the facility we can stop this from becoming very, very common.</description>

      <description>Why Companies Spend So Much on Super Bowl Ads
Thirty seconds of airtime now cost upwards of $5 million, but the game offers an unparalleled reach
https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-companies-spend-so-much-on-super-bowl-ads-1517494733 As of Thursday morning, there were more thanA two times as many male celebrities than female appearing in Super Bowl commercialsA (20 men compared with just eight women). There’s certainly fear among marketers to even seem controversial.

      <description>Read the unredacted Nunes memo: http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20180129/106822/HMTG-115-IG00-20180129-SD001.pdf Trump nears decision on releasing GOP Russia memo (AP)
Democrats have called the memo a cherry-picked list of GOP talking points that attempts to distract from the committee”s own investigation into Russian meddling in the election that sent Trump to the White House. They have prepared their own memo in response, but Republicans voted to block its immediate public release.
The drama comes as special counsel Robert Mueller also is investigating whether the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia during the campaign and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry by, among other actions, firing Comey.</description>
