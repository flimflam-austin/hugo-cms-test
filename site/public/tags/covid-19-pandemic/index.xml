      <description>Alaska is now the first state to allow those 16-and-older access to a COVID-19 vaccine. Most other states have provided vaccination access to seniors, and those with pre-existing conditions as well as front-line workers. The only vaccine with emergency use authorization for those as young as 16 is the Pfizer vaccine. Other vaccines like Moderna are testing the vaccine on those 12 and older. No vaccines studies (from Western nations) are currently being conducted with those under the age of 12 though this could change if the studies on those 12-and-older are successful.</description>
