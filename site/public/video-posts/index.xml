      <description>Fun fact ‚Äì My dad use to play in the NFL! During his days in the league, he played in 3 Super Bowls as a punter, and quarterback. This all happened in the years before I was born so I never experienced this part of his life with him, but we always watched football together and he would tell us stories about his years playing in the National Football League.</description>

      <description>It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp‚Äùst thou me?
The Bridegroom‚Äùs doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May‚Äùst hear the merry din.
He holds him with his skinny hand,
There was a ship, quoth he.
Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.</description>

      <description>I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him.</description>

      <description>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

      <description>It is not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in Zanzibar. Yet do this even till you can do better, and you may perhaps find some Symmes‚Äù Hole by which to get at the inside at last. England and France, Spain and Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front on this private sea; but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of land, though it is without doubt the direct way to India.</description>
