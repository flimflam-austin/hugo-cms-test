* The current bill stands around $1.8 trillion dollars – a reduction of the House plan that passed with more than $2 trillion.
* What’s the hold-up? In an interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi used an example on COVID-19 contact tracing to show Democrats want a stronger national plan, with more specifics – versus deferring to the states.
* Some [Republicans feels too much “bail out” money](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/stimulus-talks-republicans.html) is being provided to states with financial issues pre-dating COVID-19.
* The House Speaker continues to negotiate with members of the administration; the Senate says it will vote on a [separate bill this week around $500B](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/18/pelosi-sets-48-hour-deadline-to-reach-coronavirus-stimulus-deal-before-election.html) – focusing mainly on extra unemployment benefits, schools, and paycheck protection program (loans to businesses).
* Although the focus remains on Democrats and Republicans – some Republican lawmakers in the Senate do not like the idea of passing another massive stimulus plan.
* **Why This Matters:** Passed stimulus bills gave Americans additional funds for unemployment benefits. Many are running out of benefits altogether.
