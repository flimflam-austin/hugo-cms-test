* _“You’d have to go back and look at every room to see what was taken, what might have been touched. And of course, that’s just a horrifying thought.”_ Gerstell.
* The hack attack is only becoming public now; it’s reportedly **ongoing**.
* The gov’t believes it started in the spring.
* All signs points to Russia, but Russia denies it.
* **What Happened:** It appears hackers entered government computer systems through a cybersecurity firm (Solar Winds) – stealing the firm’s software THEY use to keep government entities safe. The firm has 300,000 customers; 18,000 had this software. Unfortunately, those 18,000 entities include governments, major corporations, OTHER tech companies and beyond.
* The hack ignited a “team” from the Dir. of National Intelligence, FBI, Dept. of Homeland Security.
* No certainty on just how many government agencies impacted or the information stolen.  
**Why It Matters:** To date, no one know how big this attack is or how much the hackers have accessed – from public information to private to classified and beyond. The most significant warning: the stealth malware used for the hacking is still “in the system” gathering information.

Many of the reports on this topic *initially* cited anonymous sources, though more are coming on the record – this is typical in a developing story with high national consequence.
