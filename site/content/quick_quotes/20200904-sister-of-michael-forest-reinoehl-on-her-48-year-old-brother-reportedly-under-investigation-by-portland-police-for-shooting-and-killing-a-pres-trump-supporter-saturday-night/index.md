* Both peaceful protests and violent riots have occurred in Portland, Oregon over the last 90 days.
* A caravan of what’s been described as “President Trump supporters” drove into downtown Portland on Saturday evening.
* Supporters of Black Lives Matters, and other causes including Antifa, confronted the caravan but it’s not clear how exactly the caravan/confrontation is [related to the shooting that happened later in the evening](https://apnews.com/9193c733a02ab33304b32e1c27ce7d55).
* Michael Reinoehl had reportedly attended protests in favor of Black Lives Matter. The Portland protests ignited after the death of George Floyd in police custody.
* The circumstances of the shooting on Saturday night continue to evolve. Investigators say a man was shot and killed around 9pm on Saturday night.
  * Friends later identified the man as a member of one of a group [often described as supporting President Trump](https://www.oregonlive.com/clark-county/2020/08/what-is-patriot-prayer-victim-wore-hat-with-groups-insignia.html). Others describe it as “[far-right.](https://www.adl.org/blog/patriot-prayer-proud-boys-organizing-potentially-combustible-portland-event?gclid=CjwKCAjwnK36BRBVEiwAsMT8WM5HjLJK4tai4CZqVfcWhcwUU27b4xHGxkunCdW9FAishGpdlt1GkxoChrgQAvD_BwE)“
  * According to reports, this group has confronted others in Portland before – these groups also have dueling descriptions either as “protestors” or “rioters” or a combination of both.
* [According to The Oregonian,](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/08/man-under-investigation-in-fatal-shooting-after-pro-trump-rally-allegedly-took-loaded-gun-to-earlier-portland-protest.html?utm_campaign=oregonian_sf&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) Reinoehl was seen leaving the scene. Reinoehl’s sister says she reached out to Portland detectives after receiving threatening calls and said she identified her brother in several photos from that night.
* Reinhoehl had previously been cited for carrying a gun at a protest & interfering with police. Allegations later dropped.
* **Why This Matters:** This follows a shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin where a 17-year-old was arrested for [allegedly shooting and killing two others](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-homicide-charges-kenosha-shooting-first-degree-homicide-jacob-blake-protest-wisconsin/) during city-wide protests after the shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake, by police. The increase of violence, with a theme of vigilante justice, signifies a marked rise in tension and violence after months of protests, riots in hotspots around the U.S.
  * On Monday, the [Department of Justice](https://twitter.com/KerriKupecDOJ/status/1300429579044171778) disclosed there have been 300 people arrested on federal charges related to rioting and civil unrest – a third of whom were arrested in Portland.
* ***UPDATE*:** On September 4, the U.S. Marshals Service [announced](https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2020/090420.htm) that Reinoehl was killed on September 3 in Olympia, Washington during a confrontation with law enforcement who sought to take him into custody in connection with a warrant issued for his arrest. Initial reports indicate Reinoehl produced a firearm, but no law enforcement officers were injured.
