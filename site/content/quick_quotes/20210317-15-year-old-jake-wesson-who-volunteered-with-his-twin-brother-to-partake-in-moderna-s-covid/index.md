Last March, Moderna started testing its COVID-19 vaccine on adults.

* The announcement of the younger age group comes earlier than expected – the results from the study for those 12 – 17 have not been released.
* This study focusing on the youngest age group will give recipients two doses, 28 days apart. The doses will have varying amounts, some as high as an adult dose.
* **Why It Matters:** Dr. Anthony Fauci, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a partner in this study), said he expected the COVID-19 vaccine to be available to high schoolers this fall and elementary school-aged children next year; that timeline was pending trials by drugmakers. Some doctors believe America cannot reach herd immunity against COVID-19 without inoculating children; others disagree.

Here’s the announcement by [Moderna](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-0).
