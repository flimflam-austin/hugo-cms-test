Anti-junta (anti-military) protestors took to the streets of the Myitkyina, the capital city of northern Myanmar’s Kachin state, as unrest continues in response to a military coup.

* Elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was ousted by the military on February 1st – protests against the military have been ongoing nationwide.
* To date, more than 60 people have reportedly been killed and thousands more detained in anti-coup demonstrations across the country.
* Myanmar has been under military rule for much of its existence since becoming independent from Britain in 1948, but held free elections in 2015. Under Kyi’s leadership, the country experienced a more democratic form of government (although also confronting criticism and controversy at times, including accusations of genocide for the targeting of the minority Muslim population in the country).
* Prior to the military coup, Kachin state itself has been the site of widespread unrest for years between ethnic groups and military forces; tens of thousands of its citizens have been displaced by that conflict.
* Why This Matters: Myanmar *appeared* to be trending towards more democratic rule and warming relations to the West. Under authoritarian rule by the military, Myanmar tilts back towards strong alliances with China.
