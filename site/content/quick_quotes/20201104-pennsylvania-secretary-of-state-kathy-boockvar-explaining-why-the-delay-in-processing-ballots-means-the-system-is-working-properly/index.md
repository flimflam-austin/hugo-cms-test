* Secretary of State Boockvar said the state received between 2.5 and 3 million mail-in and absentee ballots (vs. 260,000 in 2016). About 50% have been processed, but there are millions more left.
* Late arriving ballots are segregated from those that arrived by Election Day. However, every ballot received by November 6 (Friday) will be counted – unless there is affirmative evidence it was postmarked after November 3.
* **BIG PICTURE:** Pennsylvania is just one of the swing states we’re waiting on for official election results.
