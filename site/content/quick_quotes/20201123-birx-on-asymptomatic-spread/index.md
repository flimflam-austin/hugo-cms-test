* Dr. Birx says one reason for the rise in COVID cases in America has to do with asymptomatic spread and those extending their social circles and relaxing distancing/masking.
* She says a “cold snap in northern plains and through the heartland” through the fall pushed people indoors, and many did not wear masks inside.
* Members of the COVID-19 Task Force also did not wear masks indoors for several months during the pandemic, and initially advised against it.
* Dr. Birx says hospitalizations nationwide are about evenly divided between those 40-69 years old and those over 70-years-old.
* **Why It Matters:** Dr. Birx and others emphasized they believe that 50% of COVID cases may be asymptomatic. Previous information from the CDC said they believe for every 1 cases of COVID there are 10 unidentified. As the weather gets colder, and winter settles in America, the concern by health officials is that as people move indoors, the threat of higher transmission will lead to higher hospitalizations, ICU status and death. Although the White House says there will not be further federal “Stay At Home” orders, Dr. Birx and others are asking Americans to limit socializing.
