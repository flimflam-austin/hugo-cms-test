* Record heat in California has led to wildfires, and state-imposed rolling blackouts, due to the stress on the electric grid for the entire state.
* Severe thunderstorms afflicted the San Francisco Bay Area; lightening ignited fires in the surrounding area not known for these types of storms.
* Death Valley temperatures soared to 130 degrees – possibly [the highest temperature recorded](https://weather.com/news/news/2020-08-17-death-valley-130-degrees-sunday).
* **Why It Matters:** This follows a wild week of weather in the Midwest, with a derecho (land hurricane), causing damage to swaths of land and crops. All states handling severe weather have the added pressure of managing emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic – California has the [highest COVID-19 cases](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/california) in the nation.
