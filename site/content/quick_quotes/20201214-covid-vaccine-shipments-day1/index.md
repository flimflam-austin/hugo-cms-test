* On Monday, 145 distribution centers received the first doses of the **Pfizer-BioNTech** vaccine. On Tuesday, 425 distribution centers will get the second batch, with a third batch to 66 distribution centers scheduled for Wednesday.
  * In November, Pfizer announced the results of its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial showing its vaccine, which must be stored at an ultra-cold temperature of -80°C, is over 90% effective.
* [FedEx](https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-to-ship-first-wave-of-covid-19-vaccines-across-the-united-states/) and [UPS](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/13/946101104/ups-executive-vaccine-shipments-will-reach-distribution-centers-monday-morning) are utilizing tracking devices and Bluetooth technology to monitor the temperatures of vaccine packages.
* **BIG PICTURE:** The Pfizer-BioNTech is just the first of what’s expected to be many COVID-19 vaccines. On Friday, the Pfizer vaccine received emergency use authorization from the FDA – marking the first time a vaccine using mRNA technology has been licensed for human use in the U.S. This Thursday, the FDA will meet to consider emergency use authorization of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.
  * The first round of vaccines were administered Monday. The chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, has [said](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/16/935554943/we-can-get-back-to-normal-chief-science-adviser-responds-to-vaccine-news) he expects 20M people will receive the vaccine this month.
