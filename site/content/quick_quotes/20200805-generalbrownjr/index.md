* General Brown joined ROTC at Texas Tech as a young man. He thought [he would serve 4 years](https://today.ttu.edu/posts/2020/06/Stories/alumnus-chosen-head-air-force) on his way to becoming an engineer. Now, he will lead the Air Force.
* What changed his course? His love for flying. He is a trained fighter pilot and has flown 120 combat tours.
* General Brown was nominated for the position as Air Force boss long before the latest debate about race in America ignited in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, an African-American man, in police custody. After General Brown was unanimously approved by the Senate to lead the Air Force, he recorded a poignant video about his reflections – It’s [worth a watch](https://www.pacaf.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2210485/heres-what-im-thinking-about/) and you can also read the [transcript](https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-gen-charles-q-brown-11591744184).
* General Brown is the 22nd chief-of-staff of the U.S. Air Force, husband and father of two sons.
