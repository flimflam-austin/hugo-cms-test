* Martinez talked the health of his team scheduled to play the Florida Marlins this weekend; more than a dozen Marlin players/staff have tested positive for COVID-19.
* **UPDATE** [MARLINS SEASON PUT ON HOLD](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/marlins/2020/07/29/miami-marlins-covid-19-outbreak-latest-updates/5528087002/).
* Some have hypothesized the Marlins team could have been exposed in Atlanta where two catchers later tested positive for COVID after exhibition games.
* Other games for other teams delayed due to COVID-19 testing.
* Major League Baseball says they have set up proper procedures to protect players and keep roosters full. However, if a team cannot play due to infection, they will have to reassess potentially the entire season.
* **Why It Matters**: MLB just started an abbreviated season with an adjusted schedule due to the pandemic. A real question remains about the sustainability of the season, in light of these outbreaks, and whether or not baseball, a sport without prolonged close contact, serves as a model for other athletics, like football.
