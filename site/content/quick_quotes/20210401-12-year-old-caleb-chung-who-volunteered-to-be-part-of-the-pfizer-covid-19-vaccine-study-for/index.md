* The information about this study is not yet published – The data being quoted in headlines around the world is based on [Pfizer’s press release.](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal)
* Pfizer says 18 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosised in the placebo group versus zero cases in those receiving the vaccine. The study included 2,260 teens.
* The Pfizer vaccine is currently granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for those 16-and-older.
* Pfizer says it will ask the FDA for EUA of the vaccine for those 12-and-older within weeks.
* Just over 1 in 10 cases of COVID-19 in America are children.
* **Why This Matters:** While U.S. officials floated the idea of vaccinating high schoolers in the Fall of 2021, this could potentially move up the timeline for when the COVID-19 vaccine is available to those 12 and older.
