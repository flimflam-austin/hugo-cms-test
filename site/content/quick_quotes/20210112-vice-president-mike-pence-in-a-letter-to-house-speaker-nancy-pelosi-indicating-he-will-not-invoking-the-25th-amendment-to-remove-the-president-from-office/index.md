* **25th Amendment:** Under the 25th Amendment, the Vice President and a majority of the President’s Cabinet may declare the President unfit, allowing the Vice President to become acting president.
  * On Tuesday, the House debated a [resolution](https://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/1.10.21_25thAmendmentResolution%5BFOR%20INTRO%5D.pdf) calling on the Vice President to invoke the 25th based on Pres. Trump’s inability to “_successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office_” because of his words and actions surrounding the U.S. Capitol riot.
  * The resolution is expected to pass, but it does not have power to force the Vice President to invoke the 25th.
  * Explaining his decision, the Vice President wrote that “_the 25th Amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th in such manner would set a terrible precedent_.”
* **Impeachment:** On Wednesday, the House is expected to vote in favor of an [article of impeachment](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/articles-impeachment-trump-xml/b0422e292cebafda/full.pdf) charging Pres. Trump with “incitement of insurrection,” citing his words and actions regarding the U.S. Capitol riot.
  * At least three House Republicans are expected to vote in favor of impeachment: Reps. Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), and John Katko (R-NY). expected to vote in favor of impeachment: Reps. Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), and John Katko (R-NY).
