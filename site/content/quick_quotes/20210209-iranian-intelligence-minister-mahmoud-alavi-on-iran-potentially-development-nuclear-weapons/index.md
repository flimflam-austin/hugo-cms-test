* In recent months Iran has moved towards developing nuclear weapons (for example, enriching uranium – a key component to building a nuclear weapon).
* The [intel minister says](https://news.yahoo.com/iran-may-pursue-nuclear-weapon-095858029.html) although nuclear weapons are against the Supreme Leader’s fatwa, or religious edict, for the nation, Iran may have no choice but to pursue nuclear weapons unless America removes sanctions.
* The Trump administration exited the so-called Iran nuclear deal and levied heavy sanctions on Iran to pressure the nation away from nuclear weapons and terrorist activity; Iran was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984.
* Iran has violated terms of the nuclear deal it still has with European nations and has challenged the new Biden administration to relax Trump-era policy. [Pres. Biden said in a recent interview that he will not lift sanctions on Iran unless they stop enriching uranium](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-interview-iran-sanctions-nuclear-agreement/).
* **Why This Matters**: The rising stand-off between Iran and Washington D.C. teeters on dangerous territory. A nuclear Iran, also supporting terror groups outside its borders, not only poses a security threat but would alter political dynamics in the Middle East – potentially kicking off an arms race with other Middle Eastern nations pursuing nuclear weapons.
