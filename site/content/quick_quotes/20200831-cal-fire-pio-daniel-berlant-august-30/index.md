* Berlant says since mid-August the state has experienced 14,000 lightning strikes and 840 fires.
* Cooler temperatures aided firefighters this weekend but numerous fires continue to burn.
* 7 people have died in the multiple blazes.
* More than 60,000 people remain evacuated.
* **Why This Matters:** California is experiencing one of the worst years for wildfires in its history while also leading the nation with COVID-19 cases.
* Smoke, soot and debris impacts visibility and air quality throughout Northern California and as far away as Virginia: [SEE IMAGE HERE](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147182/august-fires-leave-vast-burn-scars-in-california)
