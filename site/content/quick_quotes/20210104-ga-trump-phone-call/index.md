* The recorded call was obtained by many news outlets including [_The Associated Pres_s](https://apnews.com/article/d503c8b4e58f7cd648fbf9a746131ec9) but [_The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html) _initially broke the story._
* The call reportedly took place on Saturday, January 2nd.
* The [transcript](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html) and [audio](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html) of the call are [available here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html).
* During the call, the President questioned Georgia officials about the election, alleging a list of irregularities (such as illegal votes, voters using P.O. box addresses illegally, lack of poll watchers, dead people voting, etc.), saying: _“I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot. And therefore, I won the state. That’s before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. You know, and I watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality._ _But I mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it’s very dangerous for you to say that.”_
* The President lost the state to President-elect Joe Biden by approx. 12,000 votes; it was the first time in nearly 30 years that a Democrat presidential candidate won the state of Georgia.
* Raffensperger [responded on social media](https://twitter.com/GaSecofState/status/1345753643593687040?s=20) to the President’s allegations which he posted as well on [social media regarding fraud](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345731043861659650?s=20) in Georgia that day after this phone call.
* **Why It Matters:** Some lawyers say the phone call may have [broken federal election laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-call-georgia.html), though legal experts also question whether prosecution of an outgoing president would take place. While the legal consequences remain TBD, a more immediate consequence of the call may surface in this week’s special election. Georgia is conducting two runoff elections for two Senate seats on Tuesday, January 5th, that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Election reliability and accuracy remains a major focus, with a record number of voters already participating in this special election. The effect of this call on voters, Republicans and Democrats, remains TBD as well.
* ***UPDATE***: Rep Lieu (D-CA) and Rep Rice (D-NY) sent [criminal referral to the FBI](https://lieu.house.gov/sites/lieu.house.gov/files/Reps%20Lieu%20and%20Rice%20Letter%20to%20Director%20Wray%202021-01-04.pdf) over President Trump/GA Sec of State call.
