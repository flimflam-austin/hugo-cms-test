    President Trump announcing his test results hours after learning one of his
    top aides also tested positive for the illness.

* The President received a test for COVID-19 on Thursday after learning one of his top aides, Hope Hicks, also tested positive.
* He announced around [midnight on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1311892190680014849?s=20) that he and First Lady Melania Trump both tested positive as well. _“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”_
* President Trump is 74-years-old.
* Here’s his earlier [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1311859538279239686?s=20) before his own test result: _“Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible! The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”_
  * Hicks traveled with the president and members of his team throughout the past week, including on a trip on Wednesday, at times in close quarters. However, there is no way of knowing if she transmitted the virus to the President.
* **Why It Matters:** President Trump’s age puts him at a higher risk for serious complications due to COVID-19. Nationwide, health experts continue to carefully watch a rise in COVID-19 cases, particularly in the Midwest, to see if the increase is temporary or a trend, heading into the critical fall months when flu will also be present. More than 1 million people have died from the illness (200,000+ in America); More than 7M infected.
* **UPDATES:**
  * The Vice President’s press secretary confirmed via [tweet](https://twitter.com/VPPressSec/status/1311997475226636291) that both Vice President Pence and the Second Lady tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday morning. Later Friday, the Vice President’s physician [revealed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/memorandum-vice-president-pences-physician/) that the Vice President is not considered a close contact with any of the individuals who tested positive and so he does not need to quarantine.
  * The President posted a [video](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1312158400352972800) to Twitter ahead of his visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday afternoon. According to the afternoon [update](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1312122950133272576) from Pres. Trump’s physician, the President received an 8 gram dose of Regeneron’s polyconal antibody cocktail, an experimental drug cocktail which is still undergoing a clinical trial.
      * Late Friday night, the President’s physician [reported](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjX-R1cXcAAcyAT?format=jpg&name=medium) that he is doing “_very well._” His physicians have elected to initiate Remdesivir therapy, and said “_he has completed his first dose and is resting comfortabl_y.”
  * Several people who attended the September 26th Rose Garden ceremony where Pres. Trump formally nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court have tested positive for COVID-19 in addition to the President and First Lady, including former White House advisor [Kellyanne Conway](https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1312214949658152960), Senators [Mike Lee](https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/1312055257992753152) and [Thom Tillis](https://twitter.com/SenThomTillis/status/1312186614215368705), Notre Dame University president [John Jenkins](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/notre-dame-president-rev-john-jenkins-tests-positive/story?id=73392144), and former New Jersey Gov. [Chris Christie](https://twitter.com/GovChristie/status/1312416381758050305), who also helped the President prepare in the days leading up to Tuesday’s presidential debate
