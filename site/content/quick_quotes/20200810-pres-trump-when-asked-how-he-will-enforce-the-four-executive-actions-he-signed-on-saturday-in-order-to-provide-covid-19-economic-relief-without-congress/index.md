* 

After weeks of failed COVID-19 relief negotiations in Congress, Pres. Trump tigned four executive orders providing for the following:

  * **$400-per-week in supplemental unemployment** **benefits** to unemployment recipients. Previously, they received an extra $600 under a program that expired in July. Under the [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/), $300 will come from the federal government, with the states being asked to cover the remaining $100.
  * **Deferral of payroll tax collection for people making less than $100k.** This fourth round of payroll tax deferrals extends the holiday from September 1 to December 31. Pres. Trump [added](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/) ‚Äú_If I‚Äôm victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I‚Äôm going to make them all permanent._‚Äú
  * **Deferral of student loan payments and interest until December 31.** An existing [policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/) set to expire in September suspended student loan payment and cut interest rates to 0%.
  * 

**Recommended protections for renters and homeowners.** The [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to ‚Äú_promote the ability of renters and homeowners to avoid eviction or foreclosure resulting from financial hardships caused by COVID-19_.‚Äù

* 

Pres. Trump received criticisms from legislators from both sides of the aisle ‚Äì but for different reasons.

  * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) [said](https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi/) ‚Äú_President Trump‚Äôs meager executive actions **do little for working families.** Republicans must come back to the negotiating table, meet us halfway and work toward a compromise that will truly help American workers and familie_s.‚Äù
  * Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) [said](https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7E22ECEA-CE33-4E4E-B109-6C0ED418170F) ‚Äú_The pen-and-phone theory of executive lawmaking is unconstitutional slop. President Obama did not have the power to unilaterally rewrite immigration law with DACA, and President **Trump does not have the power to unilaterally rewrite the payroll tax law.** Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the American people acting through their members of Congress_.‚Äù
  * The President meanwhile accused the Democrats of too many ‚Äúadd-ons‚Äù to a stimulus bill: _‚Äú‚Ä¶what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money‚Ä¶They want to bailout states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years ‚Äî and, in fact, in all cases, many decades. And we‚Äôre not willing to do that.‚Äù Read the [President‚Äôs comments HERE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/)_ôs comments HERE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/)_
