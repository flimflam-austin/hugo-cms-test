    As discussed, I will spend the next week wrapping up a few remaining matters
    important to the Administration and depart on December 23.

* AG Barr delivered his [resignation letter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1338614514493878273/photo/1) to Pres. Trump on Monday.
* “_Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job_!,” Pres. Trump said of AG Barr – despite some recent criticisms.
* Deputy AG Jeff Rosen will become the acting Attorney General until Pres-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20th.
* **WHY IT MATTERS:** Barr is Pres. Trump’s second Attorney General, nominated in late 2018 to replace Jeff Sessions. His late-term resignation comes as President-elect Joe Biden begins to name new heads of federal agencies ahead of his January 20th inauguration.
