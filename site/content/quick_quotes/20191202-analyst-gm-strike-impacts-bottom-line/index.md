* One of America’s largest automakers performed better than analysts expected for the last 3 months.
* However, the company lowered its forecast for this year and next, mainly due to the impact of the 40 day strike by the UAW – the longest strike since the 1970s.
* The strike cost the company nearly $4B for 2019 and the lost production of aroundA 300,000 cars.

**GM shows profit of $3 billion in third quarter with biggest strike costs still ahead**
