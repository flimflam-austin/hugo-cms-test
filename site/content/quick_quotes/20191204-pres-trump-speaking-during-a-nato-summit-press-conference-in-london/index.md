* **Why It Matters:** The President is in Europe marking the 70th anniversary of the alliance born out of WWII.
* **Why NATO Matters**: NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is a 29-country (mainly European nations, US & Canada) alliance that dates back to 1949. NATO provides a unified “bloc” against countries like Russia. It operates on a principle of shared defense – an attack against one NATO ally is an attack on all.
* Pres. Trump has publicly questioned the relevance and effectiveness of NATO in part because of America’s outsized financial contributions to the alliance. The U.S. pays more to fund NATO daily operations because member contributions are based on the size the nation’s economy and the U.S. has the largest economy. However, some countries like Germany, do not invest the percentage suggested for NATO allies (4% of GDP).
* The President and French Pres. Emmanuel Macron publicly disagreed on various issues ranging from the NATO military alliance to ISIS during Tuesday’s NATO summit in London.
