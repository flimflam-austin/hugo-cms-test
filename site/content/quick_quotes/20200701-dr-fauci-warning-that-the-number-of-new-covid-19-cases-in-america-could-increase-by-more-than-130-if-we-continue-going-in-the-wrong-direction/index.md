    We're going to continue to be in a lot of trouble... I would not be
    surprised if we go up to 100,000 [new cases] a day if this does not turn
    around and so I am very concerned.

* On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before a Senate committee and reiterated that he is “very concerned” about what’s going on right now, particularly in the four states that account for about 50% of new infections: **Arizona, California, Florida and Texas**.
* Dr. Fauci said that spikes will continue, citing news clips of people congregating (often without masks), people being in crowds and blatantly ignoring guidelines.
* When asked for an estimate on how many deaths could ultimately occur in America before the pandemic is over, Dr. Fauci said he could not say because models are dependent on assumptions about how the public is responding to COVID-19 and those assumptions continue to change.
