* The U.S. Supreme Court ruled an existing federal law that bans workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex ***also*** protects workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The justices reasoned that “sex” encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity
* The 6-3 landmark decision ruling that discrimination against gay and transgender employees is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written by Pres. Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote: “_Today, we must decide whether an employer can fire someone simply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer is clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids._
  * The Justice Department submitted legal briefs that argued that Title VII does not bar discrimination because of sexual orientation and that treating a transgender person less favorably than a non-transgender person because he or she is transgender is not covered under Title VII.
* Prior to the ruling, less than half of the states had laws protecting workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.f the states had laws protecting workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
