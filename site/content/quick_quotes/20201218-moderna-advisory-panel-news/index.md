* The Moderna vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine considered for Emergency Use Authorization. The F.D.A. just approved its first COVID-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, for E.U.A. last week.
* mRNA vaccines need freezers for storage. While Pfizer’s vaccine needs EXTREMELY cold temperatures, Moderna’s can use a regular freezer – making many people more optimistic about how easily it can be distributed and administered.
* **Why It Matters:** More than 3,000 people died yesterday from COVID-19 in America – another record high. Health officials believe that while no long-term studies exist on these new mRNA vaccines, they can potentially be an important piece to reducing clinical cases and deaths.
