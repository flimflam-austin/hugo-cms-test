* Zeta struck the Louisiana shoreline on Wednesday as a [Category 2](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) hurricane (96-110 mph). Its surge hit parts of Alabama and Mississippi, with additional devastating impacts expanding to neighboring states.
* Based on the latest [reports](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-dead-millions-without-power-after-zeta-sweeps-southern-states-n1245235), Zeta took three lives in Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and left over two million homes without power in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina.
* [Zeta](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml) has weakened to a tropical storm as it heads northeastward, but it is still expected to bring damaging winds and heavy rainfall.
  * FYI: “Hurricanes” (also called “tropical cyclones“) are storms with winds 74 mph or higher. Storms with winds below 74 mph are “tropical storms.”
* **BIG PICTURE:** Zeta set a [new record](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-virus-outbreak-alabama-kay-ivey-mississippi-62ac94b1114344c592f11fef63d5b87a) as the 11th named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. during a single season – surpassing the last record of 9 storms in 1916. It’s also the 27th Atlantic hurricane this year and there’s still a month left to go.
