* Republicans and Democrats remain apart on a potential economic stimulus package.
* Other stimulus packages have boosted unemployment benefits (with additional federal dollars added to state benefits) and small business loans and federal money for key industries like the airlines.

* Democrats want the spending to flow towards get cities and states that Republicans argue had economic challenges before COVID-19.
