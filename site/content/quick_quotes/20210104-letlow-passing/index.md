* Louisiana Congressman-elect Luke Letlow was married with two small children. According to Associated Press, he had no underlying health conditions.
* He was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 on Dec. 19th and passed away on Dec. 29th. [The New York Post](https://nypost.com/2021/01/02/congressman-elect-luke-letlow-41-mourned-after-covid-19-death/) reported this on the circumstances of his passing: _Letlow, 41, died of COVID-19 complications Tuesday when he suffered a heart attack after undergoing an apparently successful operation to remove a blood clot. He had been hospitalized at Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport since Dec. 23 as he battled COVID-19._
* Letlow’s seat will be filled through a special election on March 20.
* According to the latest data at the beginning of January 2021: America has more than 20M cases of COVID-19 and more than 350,000 deaths.
* **Why This Matters:** The tragic passing of the congressman does not change the political dynamics in the House of Representatives, but underscores the speed and unpredictability of the new coronavirus.
