* The Nigerian government says 279 girls were abducted from a secondary school in northern Nigeria. Previous reports placed the number of girls at 317.
* We still don’t know who exactly is behind the kidnapping. _“It’s a ploy to deny our girls … from getting the Western education in which we are far behind. We should not succumb to blackmail. My advice to government is that they should take immediate precautions to stop further abductions.”_ Lawal Abdullahi, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-kidnappng-idUSKCN2AU0BY).
* We also don’t know why the girls were released. The Nigerian President discouraged ransom payment publicly but it is thought the government (whether federal, state or local) does pay for the release of abductees. Boys previously released from another recent kidnapping told _The Wall Street Journal_ their kidnappers said [ransom had been paid](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nigerian-gunmen-release-hundreds-of-kidnapped-schoolgirls-11614666984?mod=hp_lead_pos10).
