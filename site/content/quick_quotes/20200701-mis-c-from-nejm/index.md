* The two studies: New York State Dept of Public Health examining cases in New York, and the CDC looking at cases nationwide.
* MIS-C: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.
* Important to know from both studies: syndrome surfaced weeks after the original infection.
* Rubin: “These kids were very sick.” Thus far, only 6 deaths in two groups but many remain hospitalized.
* Symptoms: prolonged fevers, respiratory systems, commonly GI systems and cardiac abnormalities.

**Important Context:** We don’t have a denominator of how many kids likely have COVID-19 infections (from lack of testing wide swaths of children without infection).
