* Based on what we know now, of the nearly 5 million votes cast, Pres. Trump is behind by **14,111 votes** – with complete results from 97 of Georgia’s 159 counties.
* The recount was not ordered at the request of Pres. Trump’ or the Republican party.
* When asked about allegations of voter fraud and irregularities, [Sec. Raffensperger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDR4i4lo32U&) explained that every legally cast ballot will be counted and that both parties will have an opportunity to observe the process. “_This is a process – it is a process defined by law. The men and women in my office will continue to follow the law,_” he explained.
* **NOW WHAT?** The recount will occur over the next nine days and must be completed by November 20.
