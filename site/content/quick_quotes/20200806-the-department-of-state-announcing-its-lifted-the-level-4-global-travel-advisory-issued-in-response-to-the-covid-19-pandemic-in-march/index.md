* The news that the State Department has lifted the **highest level travel advisory** cautioning all Americans against international travel comes a week after the global airline trade group, International Air Transport Association, [predicted](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-07-28-02/) that 55% fewer international passengers will travel in 2020 compared to 2019, and [said](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-07-28-02/) the industry is not expected to fully recover financially until 2024.
* As the world’s leader in COVID-19 cases, many countries aren’t ready to welcome U.S. travelers just yet. The **European Union** has banned American travelers since the beginning of July when it reopened its borders to international travelers, but according to [reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/05/americans-get-into-europe-coronavirus-392152), some have discovered ways to sneak in via more lenient EU nations, like the UK.
* Even if you’re allowed into another country, the U.S> gov’t is still advising anyone planning to travel abroad review the [**Travel Recommendations by Country**](http://issued) & [**Travel Advisory**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/) for their country of intended travel before booking.
