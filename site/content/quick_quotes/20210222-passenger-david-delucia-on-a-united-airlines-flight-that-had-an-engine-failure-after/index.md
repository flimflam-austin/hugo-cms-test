The plane’s manufacturer Boeing *also* recommended the grounding of its 777 aircrafts.

* [United is the only airline that flies this plane in America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56149894) – other airlines in Japan and South Korea fly this plane as well.
* No one knows what happened to the engine.
* No injuries reported for the more than 200+ people aboard, but debris rained down on the Colorado community below after takeoff from the Denver airport.
* **Why It Matters:** Unrelated to this incident, Boeing recently grounded its 737 Max aircraft due to questions about safety; [that plane recently returned to service. ](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/29/951134212/boeing-737-max-completes-first-u-s-commercial-flight-since-it-was-grounded)
