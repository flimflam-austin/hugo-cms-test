* According to the USDA, about [120](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/one_health/downloads/sars-cov2-in-animals.pdf) animals (minks, dogs, cats, lions, tigers & 1 snow leopard) have been infected with COVID-19 since the first animal (a tiger at a NYC zoo) tested positive in April. Nearly all of them had confirmed (or likely) contact with a human infected with COVID-19.
* All of the other animals were domesticated or lived in a zoo, farm, or similar setting. The Utah mink is the first *wild* animal to test positive for COVID-19, according to the [USDA](https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8015608).
* It’s not clear how this mink was infected. In recent months, several Utah farm minks tested positive for COVID-19, however the [USDA](https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8015608) says there’s “_currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating or has been established in wild populations surrounding the infected mink farm_s,” but that the wild mink’s test results showed it’s infected with a strain of COVID-19 “_indistinguishabl_e” from that of nearby farmed minks.
