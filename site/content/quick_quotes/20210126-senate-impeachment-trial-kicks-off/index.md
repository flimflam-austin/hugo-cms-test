* The impeachment trial will look different than President Trump’s first trial (and others).
* President Trump is the first president impeached twice – his second trial will occur weeks after he left office.
* President Trump was impeached on one article of impeachment on [“incitement of insurrection.”](https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-effort-live-updates/2021/01/11/955631105/impeachment-resolution-cites-trumps-incitement-of-capitol-insurrection)
* The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who usually oversees as impeachment trial, will not be present but [the position filled by a Senator Leahy (D-Vt.)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-leahy-idUSKBN29U2BV), [“the longest-serving member of the Democratic majority.”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/26/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-begin-senate-mulls-witnesses/6660660002/)
* Some Republicans argue the impeachment trial should not continue as Pres. Trump is no longer in office and impeachment is intended for those in civil positions (federal gov’t).
* Leading Democrats argue a key point to impeachment is not *just* for current officials, but for those who have left office, as a way to ban them from future positions.
* After Senators were sworn in for the impeachment trial, Republicans attempted to pass a motion to declare the impeachment trial unconstitutional. It failed.
* **Why It Matters:** In order to convict an official in an impeachment trial, the Senate would need 67 votes or two-thirds majority. The Senate is currently 50 lawmakers voting Democrat, and 50 voting Republican. The early forecasting favors Pres. Trump NOT being convicted – HOWEVER, the Senate trial will include evidence and arguments from both sides. The proper part of the trial will begin Feb. 9.
