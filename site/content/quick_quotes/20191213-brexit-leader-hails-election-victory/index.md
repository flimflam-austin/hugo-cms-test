* UK voters went to the polls Thursday for their third General Election in four years, handing a major victory to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party, in what many are calling a Brexit triumph.
* Johnson’s Conservative Party now has the majority in Parliament needed to ensure ratification of his Brexit deal, allowing the UK to officially leave the EU by the Jan. 31 Brexit deadline. His primary opponent, Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party, said he would offer voters a renegotiated Brexit deal and the option to remain in the EU.
* On Twitter, Pres. Trump congratulated Johnson on his win, and wrote “_Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U. Celebrate Boris_!”
