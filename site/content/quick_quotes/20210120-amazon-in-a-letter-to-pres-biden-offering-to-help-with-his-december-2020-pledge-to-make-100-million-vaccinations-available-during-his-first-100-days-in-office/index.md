* To date, the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) has distributed nearly 36 million vaccines, and approximately 45% (16.5 million) have been administered since December 14.
* A federal advisory panel recommended that the initial supply be distributed based on [who’s most at risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html), placing healthcare workers & long-term care residents first, frontline essential workers and those 75 & older next, followed by those 65 & older and those with underlying conditions. However, it’s up to each state to decide who’s first in line. Most states’ plans loosely mirror federal recommendations.

* In the letter, Amazon exec Dave Clarke [wrote](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/business/money-report/read-the-full-letter-amazon-sent-to-biden-offering-to-help-with-covid-19-vaccines/2284043/) that as the “**_nation’s second largest employe_**r”, many of its workers are “_essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers, and Whole Foods Market stores across the country who cannot work from home should receive the Covid-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time_.”
