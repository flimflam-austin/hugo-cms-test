* The shootings happened Tuesday afternoon.  

* Early reports suggested the shootings might be racially motivated as 6 Asian people died along with 2 white victims. Now, law enforcement said the motivation may have been connected to the shooter's alleged "sex addiction).

Jay Baker said at Wednesday's news conference. [READ MORE](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/17/us/metro-atlanta-shootings-wednesday/index.html)_
