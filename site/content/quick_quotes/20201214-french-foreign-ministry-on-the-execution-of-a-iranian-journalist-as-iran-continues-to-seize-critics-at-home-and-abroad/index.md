* Journalist Ruhollah Zam fled from Iran in 2009 and lived in France where he managed a website that would highlight protests against those in power.
* Zam traveled to Iraq last year and was kidnapped, taken to Iran, tried in June and executed by hanging.
* _“This is a monstrous and shameful act, and one which the international community must not let pass unnoticed.”_ Sherif Mansour of the Committee to Protect Journalists
* Also: The U.S. gov’t announced Iran responsible for the kidnapping and death of [FBI agent Robert Levinson](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/politics/bob-levinson-iran-sanctions/index.html) who has been missing for years.
* **Why It Matters:** Iran, a designated state sponsor of terror by the U.S. gov’t since the early 1980s, continues to press the boundaries of what’s “acceptable” by the West and silencing critics by force.
