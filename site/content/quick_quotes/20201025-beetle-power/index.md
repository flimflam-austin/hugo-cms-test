* Researchers published their work in the journal of “Nature.”
* What: _“The beetle study is part of an $8 million project funded by the U.S. Air Force to explore how the biology of creatures such as mantis shrimp and bighorn sheep could help develop impact-resistant materials.” [READ MORE](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/cant-crush-this-beetle-armor-gives-clues-to-tougher-planes)_
* How: Researchers found the beetle’s body incredibly resistant, evening after running it over with a Toyota Camry (it survived).
* WHY IT MATTERS: Scientists are looking at how the beetle’s exoskelteon comes together for inspiration on how best to engineer structures and objects.
