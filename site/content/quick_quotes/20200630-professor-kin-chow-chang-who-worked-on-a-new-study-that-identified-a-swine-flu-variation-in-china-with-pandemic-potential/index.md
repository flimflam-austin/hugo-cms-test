    Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not
    lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses.

* Researchers looked at pig populations and workers in China from 2011-2018.
* Discovered about 10% of workers had exposure to this new flu strain.
* The variation has a “G4” genotype found in pigs dating back to 2016. The challenge is that the flu vaccine available does not include protection against: “G4 EA H1N1,”
* Scientists: “Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in swine industry, should be urgently implemented,”

**Why It Matters:** Reminds us that while the focus remains on the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 we cannot ignore new research on other potential emerging viruses.
