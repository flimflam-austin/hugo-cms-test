    When you call dibs on this stay, you’re booking a night back in the 90s, but
    this time you won’t have to beg your parents to rent the latest horror
    flick–we’ll give you the keys to the entire store!

* The once ever-popular video rental store chain first opened its doors in [1985](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/710979/0000950144-94-000803.txt), and by 2004 there were more than [9,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/media/internet-kills-the-video-store.html) Blockbuster stores in America alone.
* But by [2010](https://money.cnn.com/2010/09/23/news/companies/blockbuster_bankruptcy/index.htm), as the popularity of Netflix and other streaming services grew, Blockbuster filed for [bankruptcy](https://money.cnn.com/2010/09/23/news/companies/blockbuster_bankruptcy/index.htm#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%20(CNNMoney.com),Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York.). and most of its remaining 3,000 stores began to shut their doors. In 2013, only [300](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/media/internet-kills-the-video-store.html) or so were left standing. The second-to-last Blockbuster (located in Australia) closed in 2019.
* **Here’s The Deal:** The limited-time Airbnb is open to Deschutes County residents only. On August 17th, beginning at 1pm the [**Airbnb listing**](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/44577127) will become active – allowing locals in parties up to four to book a one-night stay on September 18th, 19th, or 20th – for 4 bucks!
  * Why only $4? The owner of the store is thanking the local community for its years of support, especially most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. is thanking the local community for its years of support, especially most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.
