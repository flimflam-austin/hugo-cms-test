“Mr. Trump is innocent of the charges against him. The act of incitement never happened.” Pres. Trump’s attorney, Michael van der Veen.

* Seven Republicans joined Democrats in voting to convict the former President, falling short of the two-thirds majority required. Seventeen Republicans would have needed to cross party lines in order to convict the President.
* The trial, expected to last weeks, came to an end in just five days, hours after the House attempted to introduce witnesses unexpectedly, which was struck down in a last-minute deal.
* Why It Matters: This concludes a historic second impeachment trial of *any* federal official, and the first of a former President.
