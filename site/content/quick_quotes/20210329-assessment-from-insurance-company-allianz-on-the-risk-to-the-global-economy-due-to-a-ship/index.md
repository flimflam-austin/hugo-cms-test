About 10% of [global trade passes through this canal.](http://13%25%20of%20world%20trade%2C%20estimates%20german%20insurer%20allianz./)

* The large cargo ship, the Ever Given, was wedged perpendicular to the canal, blocking traffic. 300+ ships waiting for passage remain blocked at this time.
* The delays could lead not only to massive losses for companies but also higher prices for goods.
* [Why It Matters:](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/28/suez-canal-grounded-ship-ever-given-still-stuck-passage/7037024002/) From animals to crude oil, global trade is impacted by this traffic jam.
