Other Republicans have crossed party lines to say they will support Judge Garland, who will likely become the next Attorney General after a confirmation vote next week.

* Merrick Garland was nominated for the Supreme Court in 2016 but [blocked by then-Senate Majority Leader McConnell, who cited an election year as reason to prevent his nomination from moving forward](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/23/mcconnell-merrick-garland-attorney-general-471177). (Context: McConnell defended his decision to support Pres. Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, during an election year because he said the public had voted Republicans into the White House and the Senate – unlike the final Obama term when Republicans held the majority in the Senate but a Democrat held the White House.)
* Garland [became overwhelmed with emotion](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/02/22/merrick-garland-emotional-family-story-obligation-vpx.cnn) speaking about his family background (his grandparents fled persecution in Russia to come to America) and how that impacts his views of service to the nation.
* Garland oversaw the investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, and served as chief judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He has served under both Republican and Democrat administrations; [his first opportunity to serve in the Justice Dept. came under Pres. G. H. W. Bush.](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/background-judge-merrick-garland)
