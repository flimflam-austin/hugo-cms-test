* August’s Full Moon: August 3.

* Best time to view: Just after sunset as the [moon rises in the sky, with a slight orange/red hue](https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-august).
* Why The Name: According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac: _August’s full Moon was traditionally called the Sturgeon Moon because the giant sturgeon of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain were most readily caught during this part of summer._
* **Why It Matters:** Normally we see [12 full moons every year](https://www.space.com/16830-full-moon-calendar.html). Some years, we actually get an “extra” full moon. 2020 is that year. We will get 13 full moons; the second full moon in one month time period is called a “blue moon” – hence the expression, “once in a blue moon.”
* P.S. October will have two full moons, including one on Halloween night! [READ MORE](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/03/full-moon-2020-calendar-supermoons-lunar-eclipses-blue-moons-more/4489314002/)
