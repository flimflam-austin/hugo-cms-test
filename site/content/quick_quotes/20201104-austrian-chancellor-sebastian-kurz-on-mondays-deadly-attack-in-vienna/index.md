    It was an attack out of hatred — hatred for our fundamental values, hatred
    for our way of life, hatred for our democracy in which all people have equal

* 

A gunman opened fire at six different locations (one located near a synagogue) in the center of Austria’s capitol city on Monday, killing at least four people and wounding more than 20 others, including a police officer.

  * 

The gunman, who is believed to have acted alone, was killed during a confrontation with police. According to authorities, he was previously sentenced to prison after he attempted to join ISIS in Syria, but was released early. More than a dozen others have been detained in connection with the attack.

* 

The incident comes just days after a 21-year-old Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people at a church in **Nice, France** while carrying a Quran in an attack labeled as an act of [Islamist terrorism](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/29/929047937/3-dead-in-apparent-terrorist-attack-at-church-in-nice-france) by President Emmanuel Macron.

  * The suspect is currently hospitalized.

* Just two weeks earlier, Samuel Paty, a middle school teacher was beheaded as he walked home from school outside of Paris. Authorities say he was attacked for showing his students caricatures of the Islam Prophet Muhammad published in Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine. The suspect, an 18-year-old of Chechen origin, who was born in Russia, was killed during a confrontation with police. At least [11 people](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-teacher-beheading-9-arrests/) have been detained in connection with the attack.
  * The attack came as the main suspect involved in the terror attack at Charlie Hebdo’s headquarters is facing trial for the 2015 attack that left 12 dead.
* In response to the recent attacks in Austria and France, the UK raised its terror threat level on Tuesday from “substantial” to “severe” – the second-highest level.
