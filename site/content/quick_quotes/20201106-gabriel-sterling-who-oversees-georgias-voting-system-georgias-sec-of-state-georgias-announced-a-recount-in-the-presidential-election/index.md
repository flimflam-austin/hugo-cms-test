* _“The stakes are high…We are willing to do anything and everything to maintain trust in our election process for every Georgia regardless of partisan preference.”_ Georgia Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger announced a recount of votes for the presidential election in Georgia.
* Raffensperger – a republican – says election monitors will be able to observe the count.
* One of Georgia’s senatorial races will also head towards a recount – the second race was teetering on the edge, with the Republican candidate with an advantage.
* Pres. Trump was leading in Georgia initially but over the last several days former Vice President Joe Biden slowly gained ground, overtaking the President by roughly 1,000 votes Friday morning.
* Why It Matters: The results of Georgia’s race, along with other close margins in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, may tilt the election in one way or another.
