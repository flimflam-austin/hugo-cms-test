* The [video](https://youtu.be/fn3KWM1kuAw) shows two of the Boston Dynamics “Atlas” robots dancing to [“Do You Love Me?”](https://youtu.be/fn3KWM1kuAw)
* As [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/about) describes its business: “Changing your idea of what robots can do.”
* In December, Hyundai recently bought a $1B+ stake in Boston-dynamics.
* Why It Matters: Horaczek says it best: _“It seems like just yesterday we were watching other humanoid robots fail catastrophically (and hilariously) when trying to achieve simple tasks like walking up a set of stairs. Now they’re all but ready to start their own TikTok channel and become full-fledged influencers.”_ Horaczek _says s_ome of Boston Dynamics robots are now available for purchase at just under $75,000. This raises the question about when robots will become more of a part of mainstream life, dancing and all!
