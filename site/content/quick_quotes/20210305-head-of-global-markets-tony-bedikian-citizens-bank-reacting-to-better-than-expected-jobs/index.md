    While the labor market still has a lot of ground to make up, we are in a
    different place than we were a year ago and the economy seems poised for a
    strong rebound.

379,000 jobs added to the U.S. economy in February.

* Jobs added in hard hit sectors with large job losses during the pandemic: leisure, hospitality.
* Unemployment rate: 6.2% (slightly down from last month at 6.3%).
* Reminder: “More than four million people have quit the labor force in the last year, including those sidelined because of child care and other family responsibilities or health concerns. They are not included in the official jobless count.” ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/business/economy/february-2021-jobs-report.html))
* Overall the labor market still has a deficit of 10 million jobs since the pandemic began.

**Why This Matters**: The jobs report showed better than expected job growth in February AND a revised number for January reflecting higher job growth. America remains in a historic time – [look at this chart](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm#) to see how dramatic the job losses were during the lockdown of spring 2020.
