* **Americans continue to shop despite the pandemic.** [Consumer spending increased .5% in October.](https://apnews.com/article/consumer-spending-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-8fa1084d53063d4a9e895995a5f85a02)
  * An increase in spending is important for the economy as two-thirds of economic growth in the U.S. is determined by consumer spending.
  * The U.S. is the largest economy in the world so what happens stateside has ripple effects.
  * This barometer on the consumer spending is the lowest since April and down from the previous months.
* **The number of Americans filing for unemployment increased.** [Jobless claims](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/25/us-weekly-jobless-claims.html) increased again in the latest week from the previous week: 778,000. This number is a five week high.
  * The increase is notable because this weekly data point had shown some improvement (lower number of Americans filing for unemployment).
  * Some analysis: “Weekly unemployment insurance claims are moving in the wrong direction with the first back-to-back increases since July. Together with a slower-than-expected drop in continuing claims, we’re seeing the effects of rapidly-rising Covid-19 cases across the country. ” [Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-hit-5-week-high-as-record-coronavirus-wave-triggers-more-layoffs-11606312161?mod=home-page).
* **Why This Matters:** American spending power fuels the U.S. economy and by proxy – adds momentum to the world economy as well. With COVID cases on the rise, and restrictions once again impacting not only business owners but would-be consumers, the focus turns again to Congress and whether or not another stimulus plan with support (added unemployment benefits, loans) will pass before the Christmas holiday.not another stimulus plan with support (added unemployment benefits, loans) will pass before the Christmas holiday.
