* Beginning on [August 15](https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/), lightning ignited hundreds of wildfires across Northern California. To date, there have been over [615](https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/) new fires, burning more than [1.1](https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/) million acres across the state, resulting in the loss of [seven](https://apnews.com/c9df1469c474c684b7481f4ae873d384) lives and over [1,200](https://apnews.com/c9df1469c474c684b7481f4ae873d384) buildings and structures.
* Swain [says](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/california-fires-why-this-year-is-different.html) that unlike prior years, this year’s wildfires have reached vegetation areas. like redwoods, that typically are not susceptible to wildfires.
* **Big Picture:** The total number of fires this year increased over 60% compared to 2019, and the number of acres burned grew by nearly 260%, as of [August 16](https://www.fire.ca.gov/stats-events/). Two of this month’s fires have already ranked as #2 and #3 on the list of [California’s top 20 largest wildfires](https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11390/top20_acres.pdf) dating back to 1932.
