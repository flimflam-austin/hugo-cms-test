* President and CEO of the Idaho Potato Commission Frank Muir speaking about America’s potato harvest.
* Bad weather impacted this year’s crop, making it smaller than last years.
* **Why It Matters**: Idaho produces about a third of America’s potatoes. And we all love french fries. Muir predicts we may see a small rise in prices, but the less than impressive crop should not have a significant impact on our menu options.
