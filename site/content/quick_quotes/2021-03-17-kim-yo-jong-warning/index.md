The U.S. and South Korea are holding military exercises in the region.

* These drills happen periodically and can stoke tension with North Korea, which views these drills as provocative.
* Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Tony Blinken are on an overseas trip to Asia, visiting Japan and South Korea.
* Sec. Blinken revealed that the U.S. has reached out to North Korea but has yet to hear a response.

**Why It Matters:** The U.S. designated North Korea a state sponsor of terror - one of only a handful of countries with that designation, including [Iran, Sudan, Syria and Cuba](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/) - for supporting terrorist activity around the world. The [nuclear nation](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-koreas-military-capabilities) has threatened America and remains isolated from nearly the entire world.
