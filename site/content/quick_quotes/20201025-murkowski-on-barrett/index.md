* A simple majority is needed to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the Senate.
* Republicans hold the majority in the Senate. However a handful of Senators expressed concern about the nomination process so close to the election – one of them was Senator Murkowski.
* With Sen. Murkowski’s support, Judge Barrett will likely be confirmed in the U.S. Senate and almost immediately assume her position on the Supreme Court.
* However, since this is 2020, patience is prudent – the vote is scheduled for Monday night. Democrats continue to ask for delays of the vote.

**Why It Matters:** Confirmation to the Supreme Court is undoubtedly a history-making moment. However, the timing of this nomination make it even more interesting. Currently, 8 justices sit on the Supreme Court. There’s some question about whether or not the Supreme Court may have to get involved in the election process if there’s a legal challenge regarding the results. A 9th justice would serve as the tie-breaker.
