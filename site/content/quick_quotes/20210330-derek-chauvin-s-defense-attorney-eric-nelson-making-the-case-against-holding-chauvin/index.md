During opening arguments, Chauvin’s defense attorney argued George Floyd’s death was not a homicide and he did not die at the hands of Chauvin.

  * He said Floyd died due to a cardiac arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat) that occurred as a result of hypertension (high blood pressure), heart disease, and “_the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl, and the adrenaline flowing through his body_.”

* The defense attorney asked the jury to take into account all of the facts and evidence, including the allegations that Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill and that he struggled with law officers when taken into custody, as well as Floyd’s size, stating “_you will see that three Minneapolis police officers could not overcome the strength of Mr. Floyd.”_
* With respect to Chauvin’s actions, the defense attorney told the jury that Chauvin “_did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career_” and the “_use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing,_” arguing that the evidence will ultimately show that Chauvin is not guilty.
