Magness said the freezing winter storm was more challenging than any emergency scenarios the council had anticipated. However, board members criticize Magness for not spending time in the days ahead of the expected storm to speak about contingency plans.

* ERCOT ordered outages during the freezing temperatures in order to not overload the entire system. Those freezing temperatures lead to deaths – [impacting many, including this family in Houston.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/three-kids-their-grandmother-die-texas-house-fire-after-trying-n1258536)
* Why It Matters: Encapsulated in one report – the power grid in Texas was just under 5 minutes away from a complete outage that could have taken months to repair. Now questions turn to preparation and prevention. ERCOT will testify in front of state legislature on Thursday, Feb. 25.
