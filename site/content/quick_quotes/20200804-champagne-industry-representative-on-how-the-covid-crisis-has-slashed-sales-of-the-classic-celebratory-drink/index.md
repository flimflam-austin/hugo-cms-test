* **Did You Know?** Sparkling wine comes in many varieties, but only sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France may be called “champagne.”
* Despite reports of increasing alcohol sales and consumption in the United States during the pandemic, the closures of restaurants, and cancellation of major celebratory events, like parties and weddings, has had a devastating impact on champagne sales.
* Industry leaders [say](https://apnews.com/3a34b8e8c7781334a0bf517645c7ce5e) they expect to sell 100m fewer champagne bottles this year and a $2B loss in sales.
* Much like COVID left U.S. livestock farmers with too much product & nowhere to send it earlier this year, Champagne producers are now facing the decision of what to the excess grapes.
