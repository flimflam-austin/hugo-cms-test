* The rise in infections includes the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Maryland as well as the New York City area (according to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/16/covid-cases-rising-michigan-new-york-city/)).
* This is happening at the same time there’s a move towards leniency with COVID policies – for example, [weddings, including those with up to 150 guests, are allowed in New York City again.](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/going-to-a-wedding-in-new-york-youll-have-to-get-down-in-dance-zones-030121#:~:text=Weddings%20up%20to%20150%20people%20will%20be%20allowed%20starting%20March%2015.&text=New%20York%20State%20is%20allowing,NYC's%20four%20percent%20positivity%20rate.)
* Concerns remain over the impact of new variants. One U.K. variant is spreading rapidly within the U.S. and a [new study suggests it is deadlier than other strains](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03426-1).
* **Why This Matters:** Some European countries such as Italy are once again entering or anticipating another lockdown as cases rise. While experts like Rubin are not designating the rise in cases stateside as another surge or wave, officials are looking at these numbers with increasing wariness as spring approaches and COVID-19 policies relax nationwide.own as cases rise.
