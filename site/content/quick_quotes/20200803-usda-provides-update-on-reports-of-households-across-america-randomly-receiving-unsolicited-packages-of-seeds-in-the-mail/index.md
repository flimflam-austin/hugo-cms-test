    We are not aware of any human health risks at this time. In an abundance of
    caution, people should wear gloves and limit touching the material.

* The USDA still doesn’t know the exact origins of the packages, but [says](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/faq-unsolicited-seeds.pdf) they appear to be coming from China – though they’ve received reports of packages coming from other countries as well.
* As to the why – so far, the USDA [believes](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/faq-unsolicited-seeds.pdf) it’s part of what they call a “brushing scam” whereby sellers send unsolicited items to consumers and post fake reviews in order to increase sales. “_Brushing scams involving seed packets in international mail shipments,_” according to the USDA.
* The investigation continues, but to date, the USDA has [identified](https://www.usda.gov/media/radio/daily-newsline/2020-07-29/actuality-unsolicited-seeds-are-several-plant-species) at least 14 different species of seeds, including everything from mustard to morning glory.
* Last week, the USDA [said](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/faq-unsolicited-seeds.pdf) it received reports of unsolicited seed packages from residents in 22 states.
* **The USDA [advises](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/faq-unsolicited-seeds.pdf) taking the following steps if you receive a suspicious packages of seeds in the mail:**
  * _Save the seeds and the package they came in, including the mailing label._
  * _Do not open the seed packets._
  * _Do not plant any of the seed._
  * _f the packets are already open, place all materials (seeds and packaging) into a zip lock bag and seal it._
  * _Place everything (seeds and any packaging, including the mailing label) in a mailing envelope. Please include your name, address, and phone number so that a State or Federal agriculture official can contact you for additional information._
  * _Contact your State plant regulatory official or APHIS State plant health director for instructions or where to send the package, to arrange a no-contact pick up, or to determine a convenient drop-off location_
