  quote: There isn’t really any precedent for how to farm in a pandemic.

* Similar to well-publicized incidents of COVID-19 in meatpacking facilities, farming communities feel the impact of the pandemic amongst fruit-packers and pickers.
* Some large producers are setting up temporary housing to try to isolate workers, delaying migrant worker arrivals by stalling guest worker programs.
* Rising concern amongst farmers and losing crops to a lack of workers.
* Farm unions: “The carnage is skyrocketing” (Erik Nicholson, national vice president for United Farm Workers union)~ rising concern about lack of safety precautions, social distancing for farm workers.

**Why It Matters:** American farmers are under pressure to cultivate their crops to get them to market, but also confronting [dropping food prices](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2020/07/05/indiana-farmers-suffer-coronavirus-pandemic-low-prices/3213002001/) in some areas. The ripple effects have potential to impact what’s ultimately available to consumers.
