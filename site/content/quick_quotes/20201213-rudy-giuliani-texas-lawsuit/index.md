* Texas sued Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Georgia for allegedly illegally managing their state’s elections, asking the Supreme Court to halt the electoral college vote and ultimately overturn the results.
* The Supreme Court said that Texas [did not have the standing or legal right to file this lawsuit](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121120zr_p860.pdf) – [_“Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.’_](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121120zr_p860.pdf)
* **Why It Matters:** While Giuliani and President Trump have both publicly discussed continuing to challenge the election results, the Supreme Court’s denial to hear this case follows a consistent pattern from lower courts when it comes to legal challenges vs. the 2020 election results.
