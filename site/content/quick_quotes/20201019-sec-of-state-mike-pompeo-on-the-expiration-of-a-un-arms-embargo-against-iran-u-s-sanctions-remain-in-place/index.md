  quote: >-
    For the past 10 years, countries have refrained from selling weapons to Iran
    under various UN measures. Any country that now challenges this prohibition
    will be very clearly choosing to fuel conflict and tension over promoting
    peace and security.

    Sec. of State Mike Pompeo on the expiration of a UN arms embargo against
    Iran – U.S. sanctions remain in place.

* The arms embargo expiration is part of the “Iran Nuclear Deal” put in place by the Obama administration in 2015.
* The arms embargo previously kept foreign nations from selling weapons or military equipment to Iran. It was put in place in 2010 because of broad concern over Iran’s nuclear program, seen by some as working towards a nuclear weapon.
* **Iran’s Foreign Minister**: _“Today’s normalization of Iran’s defense cooperation with the world is a win for the cause of multilateralism and peace and security in our region.”_
* **Why It Matters**: Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terror since 1984. The U.S. contends that any sale of weapons and equipment to Iran will be used for terrorist activities.
* **In addition** – The course ahead for the U.S. highlights a stark difference between presidential candidates, President Trump & former Vice President Joe Biden – Pres. Trump stepped away from the Iran Nuclear Deal opting for stricter sanctions, calling it a “horrible one-sided deal.” VP Joe Biden worked as a part of the Obama Administration that spearheaded the agreement. Questions remain about whether or not a Biden would try to rejoin the so-called Nuclear Deal if elected President. Generally, Republicans and Democrats argue the others strategy will make America less safe.
