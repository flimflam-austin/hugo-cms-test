* Winograd: _“It appears that businesses began rehiring workers earlier and in greater numbers than expected, a trend that is likely to continue as lockdowns ease around the country. To be clear: things are very far from normal in the labor market. But the pace of improvement, if sustained, suggests more reason for hope in the second half of the year than we have seen from any previous data release.”_
* May unemployment rate improved from 14.7% in April to 13.3%.
* Jobs gains in sectors hardest hit by COVID-19 pandemic such as leisure and hospitality.
* While May saw the return of 2M+ jobs, millions and millions more remain “missing” for the labor market due to temporary lay-offs that may become permanent.
* **Why This Matters**: The report is better than expected, but it remains to be seen if this “recovery” trend continues.LEARN MORE:
