    Existing fires are displaying extreme fire behavior, new fire starts are
    likely, weather conditions are worsening, and we simply do not have enough
    resources to fully fight and contain every fire.

* Beginning on [August 15](https://www.fire.ca.gov/), lightning ignited hundreds of wildfires across Northern California. To date, those fires and the new ones that have sparked across the state since August 15 have burned more than [1.8 million](https://twitter.com/CAL_FIRE/status/1303357261390082050/photo/1) acres, resulting in the loss of eight lives and over [3,300](https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/) buildings and structures.
* The three main ones – Creek (Fresno), El Dorado (San Bernadino) and Valley (San Diego) fires – have alone burned [tens of thousands](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.6.20-September-Fires-Emergency.pdf) of acres.
* Two other fires which began last month have already ranked as #2 and #3 on the list of [California’s top 20 largest wildfires](https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11416/top20_acres.pdf) dating back to 1932 – although both are over 90% contained
* On Monday, the main power company in Central and Northern California, began the process of shutting down power in dry areas where strong winds could make things worse in the coming day. “_The power shutoff is expected to impact approximately 172,000 customers in portions of 22 counties and 7 tribal communities_,” according to [Pacific Gas and Electric](https://www.pgecurrents.com/2020/09/07/for-public-safety-due-to-severe-weather-pge-has-begun-process-of-turning-off-power-in-high-fire-threat-areas/).
* **BIG PICTURE:** Overall, this year’s wildfires have already burned over 2.2 million acres – a record for the number of acres burned in California. Compared to the same time last year, the state has seen more than [2,650](https://twitter.com/CAL_FIRE/status/1303466388317634560) more fires and nearly a [2000%](https://twitter.com/CAL_FIRE/status/1303466388317634560) increase in acres burned, and there’s still another [four](https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/) months left of this year’s fire season.
