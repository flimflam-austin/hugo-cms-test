* Health officials believe asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 account for upwards of 50% of all infections. One of the big challenges discussed to stopping the spread of COVID-19 is stopping these particular cases. However, there’s also a question about transmission – including just how contagious (and for how long) a person is with few or no symptoms.
* Another question for doctors on the FDA advisory panel: whether or not 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds should be included in potentially receiving this vaccine as part of the special status of emergency use authorization. The concern was raised because early studies included few in this lower age group.
* The FDA advisory panel is made up of experts, doctors, scientists that do not work for the government.
* Overwhelmingly the panel voted to recommend approval of this new vaccine 17:4 (with 1 vote abstaining) – as of this writing we don’t have information directly from the 4 “no” votes as to why they voted this way.
* **Why It Matters:** We don’t know if and when the FDA will grant this Pfizer COVID vaccine emergency use authorization. While the emergency use authorization of this vaccine is **not** an outright approval for use, this could be the first time this type of a vaccine, using mRNA technology, will be allowed for human use in America.
