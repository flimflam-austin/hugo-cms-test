* **THE LATEST:** Moderna is the second biotech company to announce promising clinical trial results for a COVID-19 vaccine in recent days. This data is according to a preliminary analysis by an independent data & safety monitoring board.
  * Last week, [Pfizer](https://smarthernews.com/hope-and-reality-covid19/) announced the results of its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial show it’s over 90% effective.
      * Like the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna’s is an MRNA vaccine. To date, no MRNA vaccine has been approved for human use.
    * Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna’s can be stored and shipped at normal refrigerator temperatures. It also has a longer “shelf life.” One of the challenges to developing an effective vaccine is simply logistics – getting the treatment to patients, safely and effectively.
* **ABOUT THE TRIAL:** [Moderna](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy)‘s vaccine trial involves 30,000 adult participants in the U.S. Half received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart and the other half received a placebo 28 days apart. 95 participants got COVID-19, but only five of those participants were in the group that received the vaccine; 90 received the placebo.
* **FYI:** Moderna’s president Dr. Stephen Hoge said that although the news provides hope that a vaccine will help stop COVID-19, Moderna alone can’t solve COVID-19 and many vaccines are needed.
* **BIG PICTURE:** Pfizer and Moderna have yet to apply for emergency use authorization, but they’re expected to do so soon. Officials say a vaccine could be available for vulnerable populations by the end of the year, and more widely available as early as April. could be available for vulnerable populations by the end of the year, and more widely available as early as April.
