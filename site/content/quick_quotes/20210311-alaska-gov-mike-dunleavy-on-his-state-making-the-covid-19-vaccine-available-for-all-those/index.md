Alaska is now the first state to allow those 16 and older access to a COVID-19 vaccine.

* Most other states have provided vaccination access to seniors and those with pre-existing conditions, as well as front-line workers.
* The only vaccine with emergency use authorization for those as young as 16 is the Pfizer vaccine.
* Other vaccine brands such as Moderna are testing the vaccine on those 12 and older.
* No vaccines studies (from Western nations) are currently being conducted on those under the age of 12, though this could change if the studies on those 12 and older are successful.
* Why This Matters: Some doctors believe that the only way America reaches a level of “community immunity” is to vaccinate younger adults, including teenagers. Other states (like [Texas](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/03/10/texans-age-50-and-up-are-next-in-line-for-covid-19-vaccine-beginning-next-week/) and New York) are also lowering the ages of those who qualify for vaccinations, albeit not as young as 16.
