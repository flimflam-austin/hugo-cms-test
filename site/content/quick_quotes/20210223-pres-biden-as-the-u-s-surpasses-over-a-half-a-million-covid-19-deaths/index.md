    "I ask all Americans to remember: Remember those we lost and those who are
    left behind... Let this not be a story of how far we fell, but of how far we
    climbed back up."

On Monday evening, the [President](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Te4ES1TeJ0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) [spoke](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/22/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-more-than-500000-american-lives-lost-to-covid-19/) about the more than 500,000 American lives lost to COVID-19, noting that more Americans have died from COVID than those who died fighting in WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War combined.

During an earlier press briefing by the [White House COVID-19 Response Team](https://www.c-span.org/video/?509224-1/white-house-covid-19-response-team-briefing), CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/22/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-6/) that despite the grim milestone, “_we continue to see trends head in the right direction”_ although hospital admissions, and deaths remain at very high levels, and provided the following updates:

* COVID-19 cases have declined over the last 5 weeks with the current 7-day average (approx. 66,000 cases per day) dropping 74% since the peak 7-day average on January 11.
* The current 7-day average for new COVID-19 deaths (slightly more than 1,900 deaths) have dropped 39% since the prior 7-day average — that’s the lowest since the beginning of December.
* The current 7-day average for new COVID-19 hospitalizations (6,500 per day) have declined 60% since the peak on January 9 — that’s the lowest since last fall.
