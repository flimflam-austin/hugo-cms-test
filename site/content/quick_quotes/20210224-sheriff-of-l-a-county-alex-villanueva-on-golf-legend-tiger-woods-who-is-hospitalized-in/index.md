    The interior was more or less intact, which kind of gave him the cushion to
    survive what otherwise would have been a fatal crash.

“He suffered multiple leg injuries. He is currently in surgery.” Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg.

* Woods, the only person in the SUV, lost control while on rough terrain. The SUV crossed the center divider and rolled over “several times” before halting in the brush on a steep embankment, according to the L.A. County Sheriff.
* Rescuers needed an ax and a special tool to pull him from the wreckage although a deputy sheriff said Woods was “calm” and “lucid” when help arrived.
* Woods, 45, is also in the process of recovering from his multiple back surgeries, the most recent of which had already jeopardized his attendance in the upcoming Masters Tournament.
* **Why It Matters**: The extent of his leg injuries and their impact on his golf career remains unknown at this point. Woods, a sports icon, held the top spot in professional golf’s world rankings [for more than 680 weeks](https://www.pgatour.com/stats/stat.ATR858.html), with 14 championship titles between 1997 and 2008.
