    Though we gained jobs in January after a December loss, this is not a
    we’ve-turned-the-corner report.

* [Frick want on to say](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/jobs-report-january-2021.html): _“We especially shouldn’t take solace that the unemployment rate fell dramatically given that’s mainly because more Americans dropped out of the labor force.”_
* The unemployment rate fell because fewer people are actively looking for a job – a smaller labor force is not an indication of a healthy job market. Ideally a “healthy” labor market has high labor market participation AND a lower unemployment rate because people have jobs.
* The economy added jobs – a reversal from the previous month recording job losses.
* **Why It Matters:** The economy remains “down” 10 million jobs since March/April last year when America effectively “shut down” to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Questions remain about how best to recover these jobs (economic stimulus? a changing economy?) and how that impacts the health of the U.S. economy overall.
