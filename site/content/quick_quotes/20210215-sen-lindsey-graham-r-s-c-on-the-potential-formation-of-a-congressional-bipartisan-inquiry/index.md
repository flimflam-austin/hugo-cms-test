    “We need a 9/11 commission to find out what happened and make sure it never
    happens again.”

---
The 9/11 Commission was formed in 2002 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks – through hundreds of interviews, public hearings, and research, the commission issued a report about what happened in the lead up to and after the terrorist attacks. The report took nearly 2 years.

* Both republicans and democrats, including allies of former Pres. Trump like Senator Graham, are advocating for a similar commission for the riot on January 6th, 2021.  
The goal: to create an official accounting of the events for public record. Here’s how the Associated Press put it: [_“elevate the investigation a step higher, offering a definitive government-backed accounting of events.”_](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-acquittals-impeachments-trump-impeachment-7ebcbaedd6985537dec0c3918cbf06d9)
* The creation of such a commission would likely take legislative effort.

**Why This Matters**: Although Pres. Trump was impeached and eventually acquitted for one article of impeachment, incitement of insurrection, the conversation in the aftermath over this potential commission shows the debate over what happened on January 6th, 2021, and why, may last for months, even years in official Congressional business. Whether such a proposal turns into an official inquiry remains TBD; whether such a move matches the desire by the American public remains TBD.
