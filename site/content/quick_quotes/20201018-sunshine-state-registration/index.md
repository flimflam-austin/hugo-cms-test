* Voter registration data shows Republicans narrowed the gap of voter registration, to the “lowest point in three decades…” with Democrats, who use to have a sizable lead [according to Politico](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/10/15/florida-republicans-cut-democrats-registration-edge-to-historic-low-1325644).
* _“The shift means the two parties, statistically speaking, are almost evenly matched when it comes to raw numbers, with Democrats holding a narrow 1 percent lead.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/10/15/florida-republicans-cut-democrats-registration-edge-to-historic-low-1325644))._
* Some Democrats say the gains by Republicans will not translate into votes. Others suggest voter registration reflects enthusiasm, and will benefit Republicans.
* **Why It Matters:** At the end of the day, an election is won by votes – not by voters who register. But the higher the number of people registered, the higher potential for votes to be cast and counted. And both parties want whatever advantage possible.
