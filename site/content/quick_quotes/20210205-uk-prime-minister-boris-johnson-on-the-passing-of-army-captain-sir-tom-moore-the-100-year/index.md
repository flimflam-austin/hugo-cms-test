Captain Tom developed a deep appreciation for UK healthcare workers after fracturing his hip several years ago.

* In order to show his appreciation – and stay active during lockdown – “Captain Tom” decided to attempt 100 laps around his garden for his 100th birthday; he wanted to raise 1,000 pounds (or approx. $1300) to donate to healthcare workers.
* News of his mission spread, and he ended up raising more than $40 million – and inspired others with his movement & message: #TomorrowWillBeAGoodDay.
* Captain Moore recently fell ill from pneumonia and later tested positive for COVID-19. He passed away on Feb. 2.
