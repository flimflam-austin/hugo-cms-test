* The [National Hurricane Center considers Hurricane Iota](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?start#contents) to be a “catastrophic hurricane, with extreme winds and a life-threatening storm surge.”
* Hurricanes are often categorized 1-5, 5 being the most severe. This reading is based on the force of wind – the higher the number, the stronger the storm.
* Hurricane Iota comes just two weeks after Hurricane Eta (a Category 4 storm) hit leaving an estimated 200+ dead or missing in Central America. The two hurricanes hit almost the identical location in Northern Nicaragua, impacting Honduras as well – [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/11/17/nicaragua-eta-iota-landfalls/) journalists tried to find how many times that has happened in history: _“There have been some unlucky areas and close calls before, but having two Category 4 hurricanes strike within 15 miles in just two weeks is something we couldn’t find matched in nearly 170 years of data.”_
* **History-Making:** Hurricane Iota is the [30th named storm in the Atlantic Hurricane Season](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/16/hurricane-iota-category-5-status-possible-central-america-landfall/6308866002/) (which ends on November 30th) – the most storms EVER on record.
* **Why It Matters:** The displacement of tens of thousands from their homes presents a humanitarian crisis as authorities work to evacuate residents in affected areas, which may be considered uninhabitable for weeks, if not longer.ities work to evacuate residents in affected areas, which may be considered uninhabitable for weeks, if not longer.
