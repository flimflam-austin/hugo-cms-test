    ...I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning.

* The President spoke for nearly 20 minutes in a recorded address. Here’s the [TEXT](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-farewell-address-nation/).
* He listed what he perceives as the most notable accomplishments of his term – including the economy, introduction of the Space Force, “historic peace deals in the Middle East,” confronting China, and says he is “especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars.”
* The President referred to the COVID-19 pandemic as the China Virus.
* He also addressed “free speech and open debate”: “America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are.”
