* The President spoke for nearly 20 minutes in a recorded address. Hereâ€™s the [TEXT](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-farewell-address-nation/).
* He listed what he perceives as the most notable accomplishments of his term â€“ including the economy, introduction of the Space Force, â€œhistoric peace deals in the Middle East,â€ confronting China, and says he is â€œespecially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars.â€
* The President referred to the COVID-19 pandemic as the China Virus.
* He also addressed â€œfree speech and open debateâ€: â€œAmerica is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. Thatâ€™s not who we are. It will never be who we are.â€
