* Matt Schlapp, Chair of CPAC (Conservative Political Action Committee) tweeted on Wednesday: _“AZ update: apparently the use of sharpie pens in gop precincts is causing ballots to be invalidated. Could be huge numbers of mostly Trump supporters. More to_ come.” (We can’t link to it because Twitter won’t allow us to copy it as part of their “fact checking” efforts – but here is the [source](https://twitter.com/mschlapp/status/1324040942274465792?s=20)).
* Maricopa County [issued a statement in response](https://twitter.com/maricopacounty/status/1324131969475637248?s=20) but the Arizona [Attorney General is investigating these claims](https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/arizona-attorney-general-opens-inquiry-after-hundreds-of-complaints-about-sharpies-being-used-on-ballots-in-maricopa-county/75-6da6b398-0c60-403f-a5ad-68c95a308644).
* **Why It Matters:** Some media outlets called the state of Arizona for Joe Biden early on Election Night and the Trump team immediately challenged the call – saying it was too early. This claim has surfaced as one reason why Biden remains ahead in the ballot count while vote counting continues.
