* Dr. Fauci noted that after the COVID-19 case surges we saw following Memorial Day and July 4th, we know that people tend to be careless over holiday weekends, and [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2f36_VhtU) there are specific steps this weekend in order to avoid those surges, including spending more time outdoors than indoors, wearing masks, and hand washing.
* **BIG PICTURE:** Health officials are particularly concerned about current case levels as we enter the fall and get ready to combat both the flu & COVID-19 simultaneously.rned about current case levels as we enter the fall and get ready to combat both the flu & COVID-19 simultaneously.
