    I want to use this opportunity almost have a plea to the people in this
    country to realize that we really still need to get our arms around this and
    to suppress these types of surges that weâ€™ve seen.

* During an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2f36_VhtU) with MSNBC, Dr Fauci said the U.S. is currently seeing roughly [40,000](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?utm_source=morning_brew#trends) new cases a day, but that he wants to see that number decline to 10,000 or less.
* Dr. Fauci noted that after the COVID-19 case surges we saw following Memorial Day and July 4th, we know that people tend to be careless over holiday weekends, and [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2f36_VhtU) there are specific steps this weekend in order to avoid those surges, including spending more time outdoors than indoors, wearing masks, and hand washing.
* **BIG PICTURE:** Health officials are particularly concerned about current case levels as we enter the fall and get ready to combat both the flu & COVID-19 simultaneously.
