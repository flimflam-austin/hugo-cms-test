* Professor Yuen: Roughly 97% of people wear masks in Hong Kong during morning rush. Hong Kong’s success rate is even more astonishing considering the number of travelers (roughly 1.5M of 3M a day) come from mainland China where the virus that causes COVID-19 originated.
* Research shows places that adopt mask wearing severely curb their rates of COVID-19.
* Northern European countries have been slower to adopt mask wearing than other countries, like Italy, that have been hard hit.

**Why It Matters**: Data continues to show places where mask wearing is pervasive have lower rates of COVID-19.
