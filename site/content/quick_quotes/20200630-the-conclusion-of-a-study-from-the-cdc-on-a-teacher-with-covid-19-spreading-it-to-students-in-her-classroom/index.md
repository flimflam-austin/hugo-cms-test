**Abstract**  
_After returning from Europe to the United States, on March 1, 2020, a symptomatic teacher received positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Of the 21 students exposed to the teacher in the classroom, serologic results suggested past infection for 2. Classroom contact may result in virus transmission._

* Teacher taught different classes with different students (mostly teenagers) over the course of several days before testing positive for COVID-19.
* A very small sampling of students participated in research that involved the CDC testing blood samples for evidence of past infection.

**Why This Matters:** The classroom dynamic remains a concern ahead of the school year reopening because of the potential to spread of COVID-19.
