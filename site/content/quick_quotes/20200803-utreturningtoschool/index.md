_“Based on current infection rates, more than 80 percent of Americans live in a county where at least one infected person would be expected to show up to a school of 500 students and staff in the first week, if school started today.”_ [FULL ARTICLE](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html)

* A research team at UT developed a model for risk for children returning to school using infection rates, area, and size of school
* **Why It Matters:** Although known transmission of COVID-19 from children to adult remains unknown, parents/educators are trying to assess risk with the data available. This is just one available tool, with the awareness that infection rates currently change nearly day to day.
