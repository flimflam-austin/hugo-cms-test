* Unemployment rate: 10.2% – 1.8M jobs gained (or potentially “returned”).
* Historically the unemployment rate remains extraordinarily high.
* Largest job growth in the leisure & hospitality sector – though it remains far job losses in the spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* However, we have seen the unemployment rate drop since April’s peak of more than 14%.
* **Why It Matters:** The data provides a better sense of the job market during this pandemic as some jobs returned, and communities started to live within the parameters of a “new normal.” However, it also raises questions about what the rate will look like in the fall, with further potential rolling shutdowns.
