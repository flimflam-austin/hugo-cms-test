@drdarria joins us with an impromptu visit with @drjrutland !! \

Plus - we get to see his shoe closet - total bonus. 👟 Btw - I got excited being unscripted and I missed a word “live” - What was the \*ORIGINAL\* title of @cdcgov ? “Communicable Disease Center” - it is NOW Centers For Disease Control. Thanks @drdarria for listening and clarifying. One word can make a big difference!

From @cdcgov _“On July 1, 1946 the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) opened its doors and occupied one floor of a small building in Atlanta. Its primary mission was simple yet highly challenging: prevent malaria from spreading across the nation. Armed with a budget of only $10 million and fewer than 400 employees, the agency’s early challenges included obtaining enough trucks, sprayers, and shovels necessary to wage war on mosquitoes.”_
