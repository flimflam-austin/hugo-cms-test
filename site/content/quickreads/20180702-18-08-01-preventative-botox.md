  card_text: "> a\x1CThe most promising aspect of our new approach is that **we can prolong the opioid pain relief effect for many months with a single injection** of our new bio-pharmaceuticals. This could benefit chronic pain sufferers in many ways and also avoid the terrible consequences of continuous use of opioids.a\x1D\n> \n> Bazbek Davletov, study author and chair of the biomedical science department, University of Sheffield"

    About The Study:

    ----------------


    *   **Botox blocks nerves from communicating with muscles.**

    *   When injected into the face, it prevents the facial muscles that create
    wrinkles from moving.

    *   **Researchers combined botox with a natural morphine that prevents
    nerves from transmitting pain.**

    *   End result is a less toxic & less addictive injectable than opioids.

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    *   Results showed reduced pain in mice up to 23 days.

    *   No clinical trials yet, though researchers are working toward that goal.

    *   **Each day 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose**.

    *   In October 2017, Pres. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public
    health emergency.
