    > _“When you walk over this star, I want you to remember first of all that I
    love you. And this is about hard work. And good luck. And not a whole lot
    else. You define me. Not this wonderful spot in the pavement.”_

    Garner received her star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday,
    accompanied by her children who apparently missed school, which she
    addressed by joking: "In the Garner family, fame matters more than
    education."
