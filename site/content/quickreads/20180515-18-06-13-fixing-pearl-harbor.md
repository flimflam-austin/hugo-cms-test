    Problem At Pearl Harbor

    -----------------------


    You can’t step foot onto the memorial honoring one of the most significant
    sites in American military history. And no one knows when you will be able
    to again.


    Why?

    USS Arizona

    -----------


    *   US Navy battleship bombed during first few minutes of attack on Pearl
    Harbor on Dec 7, 1941.

    *   All 1177 Americans onboard died; almost half of the total killed during
    entire attack.

    *   The USS Arizona memorial lays perpendicular on the surface across the
    sunken ship.

    *   More than 4,000 people visit the memorial every single day.

    What You Should Know:  


    ------------------------


    *   USS Arizona Memorial closed indefinitely.

    *   Memorial itself is fine; the dock to walk onto the memorial is not.

    *   Officials discovered cracks in the concrete pier that holds the dock;
    it’s been shifting over the years.

    *   Repairing the shift of 3 feet is not an easy fix.

    > “It’s not like you dig a big anchor into the ground. You’ve got an
    archaeological site right next to it that’s got the remains of over 900 men
    and the possibility of unexploded ordnance.”

    > Jacqueline Ashwell, National Park Service, Superintendent of World War II
    Valor in the Pacific National Monument, Pearl Harbor.

    We don't know how long the repairs will take or what they will cost. Guests
    will take a 15-min boat ride around the memorial to pay their respects until
    a solution is found.
