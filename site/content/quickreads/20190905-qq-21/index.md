  card_text: >-
    > “The legislature finds that the cigarette is considered the deadliest
    artifact in human history.”

    > 

    > Text of a bill in Hawaii that calls for a phased ban on cigarettes,
    gradually raising the legal buying age to 100 years old by 2024. Currently,
    the legal buying age is 18 in most states, but it's 21 in Hawaii. This new
    bill would raise the minimum buying age to 30, hiking it 10 years each year
    after, effectively prohibiting sales to all but centenarians in 5 years.
    Restrictions would not apply to ecigs, cigars or chewing tobacco.

The red tide is caused by toxins released from dead algae; it can be deadly to wildlife and irritate humans."
