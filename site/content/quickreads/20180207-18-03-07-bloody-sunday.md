    #OTD in 1965:  

    “Bloody Sunday”

    -------------------------------


    On March 7, peaceful civil rights marchers were violently attacked by police
    as they began a 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama aimed at
    ending discriminatory laws & practices used against African Americans to
    prevent them from voting.

    Why Did This Happen?

    --------------------


    *   After slavery was abolished a century earlier, Congress passed the 15th
    Amendment, which guaranteed that the right to vote could not be denied on
    the basis of race, color or prior servitude.

    *   Yet, many states passed laws and employed practices to get around the
    15th Amendment, like poll taxes, literacy exams, fraud, & intimidation.

    “Bloody Sunday”

    ---------------


    *   Nearly 600 nonviolent activists marched for six blocks before they were
    attacked by police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

    *   That night, the nation watched the horrific scene unfold on t.v.

    *   Two days later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a “symbolic” march to
    the bridge.

    *   Three weeks later, 3,000+ set out for Montgomery;A 25,000 arrived.

    Magazine in 2017:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    “They came toward us with nightsticks, beating us, pushing us, trampling us

    -------------------------------------------------


    “There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no
    Northern problem. There is only an American problem. . . . What happened in
    Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and
    State of America. . . .A And we shall overcome.”

    Five months later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act

    --------------------------------------------------------


    In August 1965, Pres. Johnson signed the Act, which prohibited
    discrimination in voting & gave the federal gov’t a way to enforce the 15th
    Amendment against the states.


    By 1969, the percent of voting-age African Americans registered to vote
    nearly tripled.
