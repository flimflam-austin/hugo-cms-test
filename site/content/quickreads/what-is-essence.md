> “MORNING
> 
> Step 1: Wash with water
> 
> First thing in the morning, cleanse your skin with only water, not cleanser. Water removes the few impurities that settle on the face during the night, and keeps skin hydrated, too.
> 
> Step 2: Toner
> 
> To balance the skin’s pH levels, it’s important to apply toner; otherwise the skin can become dry and dehydrated. Toner further helps to absorb the next products you apply.
> 
> Step 3: Essence
> 
> Essence is a hybrid between a toner and a serum. It works perfectly to hydrate the complexion, aiding cellular turnover for a youthful appearance.
> 
> Step 4: Ampoule
> 
> Similar to serums, ampoules actually comprise an even higher number of active ingredients to target specific skin care concerns. They’re used for a finite amount of time as a booster when your skin badly needs the extra help.
> 
> Step 5: Serum
> 
> Concentrated formulas with an unprecedented amount of active ingredients, serums target specific skin concerns like wrinkles, dark spots, and dehydration.
> 
> Step 6: Eye cream
> 
> Smooth a light eye cream across both the brow and socket bone moving from the inner to outer corner of the eye. Here, the skin is at its thinnest as there are no sebaceous glands to produce natural oils, so it’s important to keep this area hydrated and protected all day long.
> 
> Step 7: Moisturizer
> 
> Next apply a soothing moisturizer in a light layer across the skin for long lasting all-day hydration.
> 
> Step 8: Sunscreen
> 
> EVENING

> Step 1: Oil-based cleanser
> 
> For the evening, select an oil based cleanser to start with as this will work to remove oil- based makeup and impurities from the skin.
> 
> Step 2: Double-cleansing
> 
> Following the oil cleanser, use a water-based cleanser to gently remove the oil residue and water-based impurities from the day.
> 
> Step 3: Exfoliate
> 
> Twice a week use a gentle enzyme or bead-based exfoliator to remove the dead skin cells that can make the complexion appear lack-luster whilst blocking pores and preventing key product ingredient absorption
> 
> Step 4: Toner
> 
> In the same morning manner, next apply a toner to balance the skin’s pH levels.
> 
> Step 5: Essence
> 
> Apply your essence to hydrate the complexiona|
> 
> Step 6: Ampoule
> 
> By applying this super charged serum at night, your skin will be able to absorb all the hydration it needs following a long day’s work.a|
> 
> Step 7: Serum
> 
> Following which the serum should then be worked into the specific areas of concern.
> 
> Step 8: Sheet mask
> 
> The sheet mask is a Korean beauty favorite a a cloth saturated with skin loving ingredients! Perfect for all skin types, everyone can benefit from these masks which deliver a deeply hydrating and anti-ageing treatment.
> 
> Step 9: Eye cream
> 
> Once the skin has absorbed the ingredients from the sheet mask, apply an eye cream to protect and hydrate the delicate eye area.
> 
> Step 10: Moisturiser
> 
> Lastly, select a night time moisturizer to keep those skin loving ingredients locked in, allowing you to wake to a beautifully rejuvenated complexion.”
