    -------------------------------


    *   Tattooists will now be prohibited from coloring the whites of an
    individual’s eyes or face $10K fine.

    *   UM, SAY WHAT? The bill’s sponsor admits he wasn’t aware of any incidents
    in Indiana but says the idea came after a model in Canada had complications.

    *   Oklahoma is the only other state with a similar law.

    No Slow Pokes in the Left Lane in Idaho

    ---------------------------------------


    *   Who doesn’t get annoyed by slow drivers in the left lane? Now it’s
    grounds for a ticket in Idaho.

    *   Law forbids slow drivers in the far-left lane from impeding other
    drivers who are traveling at the speed limit.

    *   Citations would be handled like a speeding ticket & could cost you $90.
