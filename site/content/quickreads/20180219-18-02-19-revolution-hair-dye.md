    ========================


    Hair-Dye Innovation?

    --------------------


    Scientists say they’ve found a **safer, more effective way to color your
    hair**a| that may leave your strands with less static, more UV protection,
    cleaner and even better smelling.


    How? **Graphene**.

    What Is Graphene?
    =================

    “The Wonder Material”
    ---------------------

    *   A sheet of carbon atoms.
    *   Hardest material in the world, but also the thinnest and most flexible.
    *   Conducts electricity & heat.

    How Did They Do It?

    -------------------


    *   Created a water-based dye with graphene.

    *   Sprayed or combed into hair.

    *   Graphene wrapped hair like a sheet, rather than causing a chemical
    reaction to change color.

    *   Dye process 10 minutes or less.

    *   Lasted more than 30 washes = current industry dye standards.

    Graphene is naturally black in color so for now, the dye is only black as
    well. TBD until it could reach market.

*   In Search of the Perfect Hair Dye _a\\u001cYour hair is covered in these cuticle scales like the scales of a fish, and people have to use ammonia or organic amines to lift the scales and allow dye molecules to get inside. But lifting the cuticle makes the strands of the hair more brittle, and the damage is only exacerbated by the hydrogen peroxide that is used to trigger the reaction that synthesizes the dye once the pigment molecules are inside the hair.a\\u001d_A [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/science/hair-dye-graphene.html](\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/science/hair-dye-graphene.html\")

    _Replacing toxic molecular ingredients with graphene-based sheets can lead to safer hair dyes. Multifunctional hair dyes that leverage graphene’s high surface area, flexibility, electrical and thermal conductivity, and antibacterial and barrier properties can be created to render tunable hair color as well as enhanced human comfort, health, and aesthetics. The waste from graphene-coated hair can be recycled and repurposed for the creation of functional materials for other electronic or energy storage devices. Other than fashion and aesthetics, graphene-based hair dyes could also potentially benefit the development of electronics interfacing with the body, as well as livestock farming and the development of humanoid robots._
