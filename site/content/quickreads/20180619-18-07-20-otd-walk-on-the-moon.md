    The Race Into Space

    -------------------


    In 1961, three years after the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satelliteA
    into space, Pres. Kennedy announced his goal of sending an American to the
    moon by the end of the decade (and before the Soviets).


    On July 16, 1969, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Mike Collins, blasted off for the
    moon. They accomplished their mission & returned 8 days later.

    A New Era of Space Exploration?

    ===============================


    It’s been more than 45 years since NASA went to the moon.


    Astronauts say politics & costs are largely to blame.


    Today, support for NASA is bipartisan and Pres. Trump’s 2019 budget
    allocates $$ for a trip to moon, and eventually, a visit to Mars.

    The Apollo 11 astronauts left behind a U.S. flag, a patch honoring the
    Apollo 1 crew, and a plaque reading: "Here men from the planet Earth first
    set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."
