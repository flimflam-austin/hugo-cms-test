    > Chris Winkler, on having to shut down two of his four Christmas Tree

    shortage, which experts blame on the 2008 financial crisis. Trees take about
    10 years to grow and the crisis meant growers planted fewer trees to save
    money. Fear not! The shortage doesn't mean you'll have to buy an artifical
    tree, but it could mean higher prices and less selection.
