    Why Now?

    --------


    *   **America is China’s #1 customer; China is a HUGE market for American
    companies.**

    *   WH says China doesn’t trade fair: makes it difficult for U.S. biz to
    enter their market, requires companies to share research, & uses cyber
    espionage to steal our intellectual property.

    *   China is retaliating withA tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.

    This is the second round of tariffs the White House has levied on China to
    force a change in their trade policy. Currently, there are no talks
    scheduled between the two countries. U.S. has the strength of low
    unemployment & a record high stock market.
