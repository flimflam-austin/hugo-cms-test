    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    > Justice Kennedy, who is retiring, referenced _stare decisis_ in an opinion
    upholding a challenge to Roe v. Wade in 1992.

    > 

    > “In practice, the Supreme Court will usually defer to its previous
    decisions even if the soundness of the decision is in doubt.”

> _Application of the doctrine of **stare decisis** confirms that Roe’s essential holding should be reaffirmed. In reexamining that holding, the Court’s judgment is informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling the holding with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling._
