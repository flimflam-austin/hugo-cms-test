    FIGHTING WORDS
    ==============

    Hot rhetoric has reached the boiling point between Iran & the U.S.

    Here’s the CliffsNotes on the last week of this complex relationship.

    Why It Matters
  card_citation: Why It Matters

  card_text: >-
    Important Context:

    ------------------


    *   U.S. designated Iran a state sponsor of terror since 1984; only 3 other
    countries (Syria, North Korea & Sudan) share this label.

    *   Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons (which they deny) has worried several
    U.S. presidents because of Iran’s connection with terror groups & their
    desire to assert themselves as a superpower.

    Why \*Extra Tense\* Now?

    ------------------------


    *   **Saturday:** Attack on Iranian military parade killed at least 25,
    injured dozens. Iran gov’t blames U.S. and threatens retaliation.

    *   **UN General Assembly:** Iran & U.S. Presidents trade jabs.

    *   **Sanctions:**A America will implement sanctions on Iran’s oil market in
    approx. 45 days; both Iran & U.S. under pressure economically &
    diplomatically.

    > “As victims of terrorism in the past and today, we have always been and
    will always remain in the forefront of genuine confrontation with
    terrorism.”

    > 

    > Iranian Pres. Rouhani during UN address. The U.S. State Dep't just issued
    an annual report underscoring Iran's status as a state sponsor of terror and
    highlighted Iran's relationship with groups like al Qaeda.

card_5:
  card_text: "> “We are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially. We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons.”\n> \n> Pres. Trump during UN address. America received pushback from China, France, U.K and Russia (the other signatories of the original nuclear deal) about joining in sanctions on Iran's oil exports; they want to stay in the nuclear deal, for now."

    U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Matt responded to Iranian threats: "We've been
    clear; they shouldn't take us on like that". FYI: Iran fired rockets at U.S.
    embassy in Baghdad & consulate in Basra in early Sept after blaming America
    for igniting anti-Iran dissent.
