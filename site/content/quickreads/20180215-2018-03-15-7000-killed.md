    Deaths By Firearms  

    A Look At 7,000 Deaths

    -------------------------------------------


    *   The 7,000 estimate is based on a study that examined Centers for Disease
    Control figures showing that 1,300 children (ages 0 – 17 years) die from gun
    violence every year.

    *   **53% homicides, 38% suicide**, 6% unintentional & 3% undetermined

    Doing the Math:  

    7,000 Deaths

    ------------------------------


    *   Newtown school shooting took place 5+ years ago in Dec 2012.

    *   1,300 deaths x 5.3 = roughly 6,800 children deaths.

    *   By the end of 2018, the number will rise to **approx. 7,800**.

    *   REMINDER: This includes **ALL deaths related to firearms – NOT just
    school shootings**.
