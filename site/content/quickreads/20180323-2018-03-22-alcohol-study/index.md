    Like A No-No

    -------------------------------


    The **fundraising may have violated N.I.H. policy**, which prohibits
    employees from soliciting or suggesting donations, funds or other resources
    intended to support activities.


    At the very least, it may raise questions about the **scientific integrity
    of the trial**.

    The N.I.H. is now investigating the fundraising outreach. Nevertheless, the
    NYT reports the study "may well be the last word on the subject of moderate
    drinking, since trials like these are both expensive and logistically
    complicated to carry out."
