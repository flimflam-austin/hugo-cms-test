    About the Woman:

    ================


    *   Despite her exceptional academic credentials (#2 in her class at
    Stanford Law), she couldn’t find a law firm that would hire a woman. **Her
    first law job was unpaid.**

    *   From 1960-65, she was a **stay-at-home mom** to her three sons.

    *   In 1965, she became the Arizona Assistant Attorney General, and later
    she became the **first female Senate Majority Leader** (R) in AZ.

Wade_ and striking down a PA law requiring women to obtain **spousal consent for abortion**.\n\nIn 2000, she cast the deciding vote inA _Bush v. Gore,_ settling the dispute in the **2000 election** and awarding the presidency to George W. Bush."
card_5:
  card_text: "> “Treat people well. Dona\x19t mislead them. Dona\x19t be prickly. Dona\x19t say things that are aggravating. Try to be as agreeable as you can be. Try to be helpful rather than harmful. Try to cooperate.\n> \n> O'Connor in 2013 to the Harvard Business Review on what it's like working with colleagues with whom you disagree (potentially) for life. Supreme Court justices have lifetime tenure."
