    GOING TO POT?

    =============


    Canada becomes the 2nd nation in the world to legalize marijuana – will the
    U.S. follow suit?

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    New signs suggest the existing U.S. **federal ban _against_ marijuana could
    become a ban _against_ the federal gov’t interfering** in states where it’s
    legal.

    *   In 1998, medical marijuana was legal in 5 states. By 2008, that number
    nearly tripled. **Today, it is legal in 29 states + DC.**

    Marijuana: State vs. Feds

    -------------------------


    **Marijuana is illegal under federal law.** But, as more states began to
    legalize it within their borders, the federal gov’t shifted its focus away
    from prosecuting **\*most\* marijuana-related crimes** in situations where
    there is compliance with state laws.


    Instead, opting to focus on “**serious drug traffickers while taking into
    account state and local laws**.”

    Policy Change?

    --------------


    *   **January 2018:A** Atty General Jeff Sessions rescinded Obama-era
    policies that eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws, instead opting
    for a tougher stance.

    *   **June 2018:** Just last week, Pres. Trump indicated he is willing to
    loosen the federal blanket ban on marijuana in states where it is legal.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   Pres. Trump **did NOT say** he will end the federal ban on marijuana.

    *   However, he DID say he is willing to support a federal bipartisan bill,
    which would **ease enforcement of the federal ban on marijuana in states
    where it’s legal.**

    *   The bill would **NOT legalize marijuana** on the federal level or force
    states to take any action.
