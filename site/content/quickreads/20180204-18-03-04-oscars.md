    _According to an analysis by the Women’s Media Center:_


    Women make up **23%** of 2018 nominees in behind-the-scenes roles – **that’s
    a small, but significant increase**.


    From 2005 – 2016, **less than a fifth** of non-acting nominations went to
    women.

    In an interview with CNN, Mudbound's Rachel Morrison said "Sure, there's the
    historical significance of it all, but just seeing me get the accolades that
    have been \[denied so many women in the past\] has really been the light at
    the end of the tunnel for so many women and the encouragement they needed to
    keep shooting."
