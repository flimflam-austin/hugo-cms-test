    * A Minneapolis convenience store worker calls police, accusing George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, of using a counterfeit $20. 

    * Police respond & arrest Floyd. Police say Floyd “physically resisted officers.” 

    * Bystander video shows Floyd on the ground, face down & handcuffed, with officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee on Floyd’s neck.

  card_citation: " George Floyd. \"8 minutes and 46 seconds\" became a rallying
    cry for protestors, referencing the time Chauvin held his knee on George
    Floyd's neck. Notably, court documents have listed a range of times from 7
    minutes 46 secs to *more* than 9 minutes for this interaction. The timing
    will be relevant to both sides. Video appears to show Floyd fall
    unconscious. Shortly afterwards, he is loaded into an ambulance and later
    declared dead at a local hospital"

    ## IMPORTANT CONTEXT


    Much about the events of May 25, 2020 comes from police and bystander videos.


    However, NONE of the videos released from various perspectives show the entire length of the encounter.


    We expect to learn a lot more about the details of the incident during the course of the upcoming trials.
