    > “Ellis Island was very unpopular much in the media. When it was opened it
    was very controversial, and as the years went on become more controversial.A
    So these things happening today, the issues are a little different but these
    controversies and some of the main points are the same.A There were some of

    were leveled then in 1890.”
