    Why Study This?

    ===============


    Researchers Say:

    ----------------


    *   1/3 of Americans experience sleep loss.

    *   Sleep loss impacts our performance and quality of life.

    *   Caffiene can boost our performance when used correctly – so they
    developed “an app for that.”

    How Does It Work?

    -----------------


    The app uses an algorithim that considers your sleep cycle and how much
    caffeine you plan to consume – and then spits out what you should drink and
    when.


    Researchers found users upgraded their performance by more than 60% &
    ironically reduced their caffeine consumption by more than 60%.

    Cappucino?

    ----------


    *   6 out of 10 Americans drink coffee daily – this has held steady over the
    last several years.

    *   Coffee drinkers consume nearly 3 cups on avg. every day.

    *   Women drink _slightly_ more coffee than men.

    *   Previous Research: 500 mg of caffeine (2 cups of coffee) or lower = best
    health benefits.
