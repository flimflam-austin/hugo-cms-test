    Background

    ----------


    CIA started releasing more personal info on the notoriously secretive Haspel
    for “Women’s History Month” in March – under the umbrella of honoring women
    in the CIA.


    Critics say this is “propaganda” by CIA to deter from questions about
    Haspel’s record on torture.
