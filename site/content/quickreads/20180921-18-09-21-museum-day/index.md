    How Much Should It Cost?

    ------------------------


    *   About **one-third** of America’s **35,000+ museums** are free.

    *   But with funding under pressure, museums struggle with how much to
    charge.

    *   **Ticket prices are crucial: Admissions represent 7%** of museum’s
    financial support, behind **endowments (22%) & museum store purchases
    (8%).**
