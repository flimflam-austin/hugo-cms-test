    Why This Matters

    ================


    *   Measles is a **highly contagious** and potentially deadly disease.

    *   Unlike some deadly diseases, an effective **vaccine is available**.

    *   Two doses of vaccine is about **97% effective**, according to CDC.

    *   Notable: 2017 spike in measles cases came after a record low year of

    _In 1978, CDC set a goal to eliminate measles from the United States by 1982. Although this goal was not met, widespread use of measles vaccine drastically reduced the disease rates. By 1981, the number of reported measles cases was 80% less compared with the previous year. However, a 1989 measles outbreaks among vaccinated school-aged children prompted the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) to recommend a second dose of MMR vaccine for all children. Following widespread implementation of this recommendation and improvements in first-dose MMR vaccine coverage, reported measles cases declined even more._
