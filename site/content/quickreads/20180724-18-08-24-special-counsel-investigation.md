    BACKSTORY:

    ==========


    In March 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from
    investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign.


    In May 2017, the Deputy Attorney General appointed Robert Mueller, the
    former FBI Director (2001 – 2013), as Special Counsel to oversee the
    Trump-Russia investigation.

    > “I did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty, but he was …. the charges were
    legitimate, but the prosecution tried to make the case about the Russian
    collusion ….. I think that they used Manafort to try to get the dirt on
    Trump.”

    > Paula Duncan, one of 12 jurors who decided the Paul Manafort case, to 'Fox
    News At Night.' Duncan, a Trump supporter, said she (and 10 of her fellow
    jurors) would've found Manafort guilty of all 18 counts but for one holdout
    juror.
