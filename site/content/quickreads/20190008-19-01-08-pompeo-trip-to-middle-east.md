    Why Is He Going?A  


    --------------------


    Sec. Pompeo’s 2 declared priorities:


    *   U.S. will continue to **battle ISIS,**A **but change tactics** (withdraw
    troops from Syria, though he sets no timeline. Nat’l Sec. Advisor Bolton
    echoed this sentiment in Israel over the wknd).

    *   U.S. will continue to work to **thwart Iran** & its “dangerous”
    activities in the Middle East.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), responding to a question about whether the President's declaration that 2,000 U.S. troops will withdraw from Syria was a \"mistake.\" A day after Pres. Trump's announcement, fmr. Sec. of Def Mattis resigned & emphasized the importance of America's allies. NS Advisor John Bolton & Sec. Pompeo are now meeting with key regional Mideast allies."

Obama official, now w/the bipartisan nonprofit Center for a New American Security. Sec. Pompeo plans to speak about America's Middle East policy while in Cairo - the same city Pres. Obama delivered a speech on the same topic."

    YOUR SAFETY AT STAKE

    --------------------


    *   **ISIS:** Last week, two Americans were reportedly captured fighting
    with ISIS in Syria – a reminder of the terrorist group’s powerful ideology
    despite loss of territory.

    *   **Iran:** Funds terrorist organizations, wants to expand anti-American
    influence in region and is suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons.

    Also on Agenda: Yemen

    ---------------------


    *   Yemen, site of a major civil war & humanitarian crisis.

    *   Home to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a dangerous branch
    that plots against U.S & plays a role in the terrorist group’s global
    leadership.

    *   On Jan. 1, a U.S. airstrike killed a suspected al-Qaeda terrorist.

    *   Ally support makes these drone strikes possible.
