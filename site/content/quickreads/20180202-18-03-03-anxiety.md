    About the Study:

    ----------------


    *   80 participants screened on their levels of anxiety & then asked to
    study a set of words

    *   Next, the words were shown to them over various images – some neutral
    pics & some negative.

    *   Only difference in their memory recall? Those with high levels of
    anxiety remembered the words more accurately when they were shown over the
    negative images.

Overall, that could mean that anxious people have a memory advantage over non-anxious people, says Fernandes, especially in emotional situations. But it also has a downside: It shows how people can adopt a a\\u001cnegative retrieval modea\\u001d when recalling events, which could lead to biased memories. a\\u001c_For people with high anxiety, the emotional context in the background tainted their later memory of these words that were otherwise neutral_,a\\u001d says Fernandes.A Co-author Christopher Lee says most people have probably experienced this type of memory bias at some point. a\\u001c_Say youa\\u0019re having the worst day possiblea\\u0014you slept through your alarm, you slipped and fell in muda\\u0014and then the barista atA StarbucksA asks you a totally neutral question, like if you want whipped cream on your mocha_,a\\u001d he says. a\\u001c_Because you entered this situation in such a negative mindset, you may remember him being rude or hostile or horrible for some reason, even when hea\\u0019s not._a\\u001d
