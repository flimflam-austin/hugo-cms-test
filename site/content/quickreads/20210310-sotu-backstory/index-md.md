    ### On the eve of the President's first prime-time address to the nation - a
    lingering question about when he'll address Congress.


    ### **What's the tradition of the State of the Union?**


    ### What to know. Why it matters.

    The President *“shall **from time to time** give to the Congress Information
    of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such
    measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”*


    The Constitution does not stipulate when or how the President speaks to Congress nor mandate a "State of the Union" address, though the tradition dates back to Pres. Washington.

    ## What Is "Tradition"? 


    * Recent tradition is that newly-elected presidents wait a full year before they give their first State of the Union Address to Congress and the nation.

    * What do they do in the meantime? Newly-elected Presidents typically give **\*an address before a joint session of Congress\*** outlining goals.

    * The tradition of addressing a joint session in this way during the 1st year of office began with Pres. Reagan in 1981.
