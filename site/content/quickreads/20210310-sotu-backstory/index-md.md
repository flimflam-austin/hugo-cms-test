    ### On the eve of the President's first prime-time address to the nation - a
    lingering question about when he'll address Congress.


    ### **What's the tradition of the State of the Union?**


    ### What to know. Why it matters.
card_2:
  card_text: >-
    The President *“shall **from time to time** give to the Congress Information
    of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such
    measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”*


    The Constitution does not stipulate when or how the President speaks to Congress nor mandate a "State of the Union" address, though the tradition dates back to Pres. Washington.

    ## What Is "Tradition"? 


    * Recent tradition is that newly-elected presidents wait a full year before they give their first State of the Union Address to Congress and the nation.

    * What do they do in the meantime? Newly-elected Presidents typically give **\*an address before a joint session of Congress\*** outlining goals.

    * The tradition of addressing a joint session in this way during the 1st year of office began with Pres. Reagan in 1981.

    ## Something To Consider:


    * Every president since Pres. Reagan has addressed a joint session of Congress \*in February\* during his first term in office. **Pres. Biden is the first one to not do so in 40 years.**

    * White House: Pres. Biden is focused on the pandemic & the COVID-19 relief package, but they "intend" for the president to deliver a joint address and have "engaged closely" with Congress about future plans.
card_10:
  card_text: While no date has been set (so far) for Pres. Biden address to
    Congress, tradition says he doesn't have to talk at all – for about 100
    years what's now called the State of the Union address was delivered in
    writing. Meanwhile, Pres. Biden's prime-time address Thursday night will
    mark a year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
    "pandemic."
