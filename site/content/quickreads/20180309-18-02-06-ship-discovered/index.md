    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    *   USS LexingtonA = FIRST American aircraft carrier to sink at war

    *   Battle of Coral Sea = FIRST “air-sea” battle in history; opposing ships
    NEVER saw each other.

    *   Marked a notable shift in WWII &A America’s success containing Japanese.

    *   A month later, the “Battle of Midway” turns the tide of the war in
    America’s favor.
