*   **SmartHER Take:** The so-called “Waffle House” shooting is the second mass shooting in 2018 where the shooter was KNOWN to law enforcement; the alleged high school shooter in Parkland Florida was also known to local police before his murderous rampage and reported to the FBI through a tipline. We will continue to investigate what led to the identification of these threatening would-be criminals but the inability to stop a horrendous crime.
