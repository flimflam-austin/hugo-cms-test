    COLLISION COURSE

    ================


    Despite being an island paradise in the middle of wide open ocean,
    hurricanes rarely hit Hawaii.  

    **Why?**
card_2:
  card_text: "Why So Rare?\n------------\n\n> a\x1CYoua\x19re a pretty small spot in a large ocean, and to have something hit you takes a bit of an unfortunate alignment of things.a\x1D\n> \n> Brian McNoldy, University of Miami meterologist says only 5 storms as strong as Hurricane Lane have EVER been recorded \\*near\\* Hawaii. Wind patterns tend to keep storms away."

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   Hawaii marked its anniversary as America’s 50th state **this week** on
    Aug 21 (1959) – only state that’s all islands.

    *   Since hurricanes rarely hit Hawaii, higher risk of significant damage:
    not enough shelters, less prepared, difficult to reach.

    *   All 8 islands in danger.

    *   Officials want citizens to have essential supplies for 14 days.

One warning?\n> \n> a\x1CIt is very important to remember that it only takes one landfalling tropical cyclone to bring major impacts to the State of Hawaii.a\x1D"

    What’s The Difference?
    ======================

    Cyclone vs. Hurricane
    ---------------------

    > **NOTHING.  
    > **You might hear both.

    > “Hurricanes and typhoons are the same weather phenomenon:

    NOAA forecasts suggest a "normal" hurricane season for the Atlantic (0-2
    major hurricanes). Want to see how rare it is for Hawaii to have a
    hurricane? Check out an amazing graphic from NOAA on our source page as well
    as an update on the Kilauea Volcano eruptions.
