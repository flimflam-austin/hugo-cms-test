    How Did We Get Here?

    --------------------


    First pumpkin spice reference dates back to 1796, but it was McCormick & Co.
    who brought it to store shelves in 1934.


    McCormick usesA **cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg & allspice –** _**not pumpkin**._


    Starbucks debuted its pumpkin spice latte in 2003, which is credited for the
    craze as we know it today.
