    Why Now?

    ========


    *   **Oversupply** of crops (at home & overseas) fuels lower prices.

    *   **High Debt** – Farmers currently carrying the highest debt in 4 decades
    (in part because of borrowing to cover several years of low crop prices).

    *   **Trade**: Tariffs (or taxes) on American grown crops exported to China
    or Mexico hurts farmers on top of the depressed prices.

Then the trade dispute happened and that really put a damper on things.a\x1D\n> \n> Curt Hudnutt, Head of Rural Banking for Rabobank, one of the biggest U.S. farm lenders, warning bankruptcies among U.S. farmers will increase. The majority of farms lost money last year."

Trump created a $12B fund to help subsidize farmers impacted by trade disputes. Only a portion of the funds have been accessed."

    The downward trend in prices is predicted to continue for U.S. farmers. U.S.
    Treasury Sec. Mnuchin is in China today, where he will continue trade talks
    this week ahead of the March 2nd deal deadline for the two sides to set new
    terms or continue the trade war.
