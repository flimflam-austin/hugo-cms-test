    POISONOUS LEAVES?

    =================


    *   **Not true**. Poison Control has debunked the often-quoted myth that
    Poinsettias’ sap can be dangerous to small kids & dogs**.**

    *   While irritating, a study found a 50-pound child would have to **eat 500
    leaves** for a harmful effect.

    *   Researchers say the taste would be awful, but advise **keeping it away
    from pets** because it may cause vomiting & diarrhea.

    HOW DO YOU SAY IT?

    ==================


    Poin-set-ah?  

    Poin-set-ee-ah?

    ------------------------------


    The dictionary says both are technically correct.


    But since it was named after a person, Poinsett, English scholars believe
    the added **“ia” should be pronounced** (Poin-set-ee-ah) & it should always
    be **capitalized**.
