    WHO KEEPS OUR NATION’S TOP SECRETS?

    -----------------------------------


    > **4+ million Americans have security clearances.**

    > 

    > **President Trump revoked 1**.

    > 

    > Why some say stripping former CIA Dir. John Brennan of his clearance is an
    attack on free speech, while others say it had to be done.

    Who Keeps Clearance?

    --------------------


    *   **Who**: Former federal employees who had on the job security
    clearances.

    *   **Why**: In case a need arises when he or she can be of use to the
    current administration.

    *   **How long**: Clearance continues (with periodic reviews) as long as
    person avoids sharing classified info, getting into debt, & traveling to
    certain parts of the world, etc.

    Bigger Picture:

    ---------------


    *   Current \*Security Clearance\* system deemed “high risk” by gov’t
    watchdog.

    *   Too many people have security clearances (est. 1.4M at “top secret”
    level) & continual reviews of their eligibility are inconsistent.

    *   Evaluations take too long. More than 700,000 people waiting for security
    clearance, according to most recent estimates.

    John Brennan’s Response:

    ------------------------


    > “This action is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom
    of speech & punish critics.A It should gravely worry all Americans,
    including intelligence professionals, about the cost of speaking out. My
    principles are worth far more than clearances. I will not relent.”

card_10:

    The topic of revoking security clearances came up several weeks ago when
    some, like Brennan criticized the President's meeting with Vladimir Putin.
    Is Brennan sowing "division & chaos" or exercising free speech? Does social
    media change the equation?

*   **SOMETHING TO CONSIDER:** Deputy Dir of the CIA, Mike Morrell, says the argument officials use classified information to criticize the administration doesn’t work because…”Senators and Congressman have security clearances. Senators and Congressman know classified information. And they talk to the media all the time too.” Listen to more here:
