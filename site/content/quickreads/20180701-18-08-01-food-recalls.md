    ---------------

    OR (very seldom) required.

    93%A** in same period, according to industry consultant, Stericycle. FDA
    disputes this data.

    Why All the Recalls?

    --------------------


    **New technology** has regulators & companies able to track down
    contaminants more quickly.


    **Industry consolidation** has different products using the same supply
    chain, so an issue with one supplier can affect multiple products.

    Important to Note

    =================


    It’s not just toxic bacteria that lead to recalls. **Food allergens** made
    up nearly **half (47%) of FDA food recalls & 29% of USDA recalls** in the
    first quarter of this year.


    Congress required food labels to include allergens in 2006, so if an item
    comes in contact with something not listed on packaging, it is recalled.

    You might be surprised to learn how long it takes from the time of discovery
    of a problem to pulling an item off store shelves. An Inspector General
    investigation found it took an average 57 days. A poignant investigation
    takes a closer look - Visit SmartHerNews.com.
