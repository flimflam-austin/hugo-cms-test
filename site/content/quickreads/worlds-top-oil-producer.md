    Don’t Mess with Texas

    =====================


    *   U.S. produces 11M barrels oil per day – more than any country in the
    world for **1stA time since 1973**.

    *   Texas is responsible for **one-fifth of U.S. production**A due to shale
    drilling boom.

    *   **Texas is now on track to produce more oil than Iraq & Iran;**A Mideast
    instability has impacted that region’s oil markets.

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   More production at home makes the U.S. less reliant on volatile Middle
    East, creating more jobs for production & distribution.

    *   Also important to remember: **Oil is a global market.** If Saudi Arabia
    or Russia ramped up production dramatically, it could drive prices lower –
    potentially to a point that would make extracting oil from shale not worth
    it financially.

    The Department of Energy expects US oil production next year to continue at
    this pace or slightly higher, allowing it to remain the world's #1 oil
    producer through 2019.
