    What’s At Stake?

    ----------------


    *   Supreme Court Justice **serves for lifetime.**

    *   Pres nominates Judge; **Senate must confirm.**

    *   Court functions even if all 9 seats aren’t filled; currently 4 “left
    leaning” & 4 “conservative” justices.

    *   Kavanaugh described as a “conservative” judge, which would tip the court
    to the “right.”
card_3:

    *   **July**: Accuser calls newspaper tip line when Judge Kavanaugh
    reportedly on short list of Supreme Court nominees; declines going “on
    record.”A **July 9th**: Kavanaugh nominated.

    *   Accuser sends confidential letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA),
    declines coming forward. Feinstein refers letter to feds.

    *   Story leaks **after** Senate Judiciary Hearing ends.

    Timing Matters

    --------------


    *   Senate Judiciary Cmte was scheduled to vote THIS Thursday for/against
    Judge Kavanaugh. **This isn’t happening.**

    *   **RepublicansA** want Kavanaugh confirmed before midterms (Nov) & next
    SCOTUS term (Oct).

    *   **DemocratsA** want to delay vote; if Senate flips to Dem majority after
    midterms they can block Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

    Some Things To Consider:

    ------------------------


    *   Allegations never surfaced during ANY of Kavanaugh’s prior character
    checks (applying to law school, bar, or federal judge).

    *   The accuser has NOT filed a criminal complaint, but her lawyers says she
    will share her story with the Senate.

    *   No other accusers have come forward at this time.
card_10:
  card_text: >-
    On Monday, Sept 24th, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a public
    hearing, during which Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey
    Ford, will both appear one after the other and testify under oath.
