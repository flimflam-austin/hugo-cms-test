    Major Takeaways: Summit

    -----------------------


    **Pres. Trump** declined to denounce Russia for 2016 election meddling
    saying “_I don’t see any reason why_” Russia would interfere andA “_Putin
    was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today_.”


    **Pres. Putin** confirmed he wanted Trump to win election “_because he
    talked about bringing the U.S. Russia relationship back to normal._“

    How does the U.S. gov't define Russian "meddling"? It's a blanket term often
    referring to online "mischief" - hacking, spreading misinformation, and
    beyond. There's no evidence of changing votes or impacting election results
    - but still illegal.

> “Twelve Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of private communications in a sweeping conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election, according to an indictment announced days before President Donald Trumpa\\u0019s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
> 
> The indictment represents special counsel Robert Muellera\\u0019s first charges against Russian government officials for interfering in American politics, an effort U.S. intelligence agencies say was aimed at helping the Trump campaign and harming his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The case follows a separate indictment that accused Russians of using social media to sow discord among American voters.

> ….
> 
> Mueller did not allege that Trump campaign associates were involved in the hacking effort, that Americans were knowingly in touch with Russian intelligence officers or that any vote tallies were altered by hacking.”
