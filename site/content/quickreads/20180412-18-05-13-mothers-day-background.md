    By the 1920s, mothers nationwide were showered with candy, flowers, cards, &
    other gifts to celebrate Mother’s Day.


    Jarvis, frustrated with the commercialization of the holiday, that she
    intended as a day to **honor the role mothers play in the family, church,
    and community**, spent the rest of her life fighting against its commercial
    success.
