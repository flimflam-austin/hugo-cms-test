    THE WHOLE ANSWER
    ================

    Once and for all, has the debate over dairy finally ended?

    New research says Yes! (Maybe…)

    Dairy, Disease & Death

    ----------------------


    *   New study surveyed 135,000+ people in 21 countries, ages 35-70, over a
    9-year period.

    *   Researchers found those who consumed more milk & yogurt (either whole or
    low-fat), had lower risk of heart disease & death; cheese & butter did not
    result in any change.

    *   The study is limited and doesn’t explain WHY this is the case.

    > “Parents have started to look at milk not as a good thing and they are
    wary of it. The message to them is not to be scared of milk, or to limit its
    consumption, and to encourage children of all ages to keep drinking it
    freely.”

    > 

    > Dr. Mona Eissa, The University of Texas Health Science Center, on a
    separate study that researched obese children & dairy consumption, which
    found obese children who drank \*any\* milk had better blood sugar control.

    > “Greater consumption of total dairy products may be of importance in the
    prevention of weight gain in middle-aged and elderly women who are initially
    normal weight.”

    > 

    > Study published in the American Journal of Nutrition 2016 that examined
    dairy consumption & weight gain in women. The authors found women with
    higher intakes of fat from dairy had lower weight gain.

    Whole Milk: Bad Rap?

    --------------------


    *   Low-fat milk provides same calcium and nutrients as whole milk, just
    with lower calories/fat.

    *   However, as we lower our fat content, we tend to eat more carbs and
    sugar.

    *   Science has not fully explained why whole dairy products may lower our
    risk for diabetes, or weight gain.

    Overall, Americans are drinking less milk & obesity rates are rising. Some
    say lack of dairy is a factor since we often replace milk with other
    beverages. However, docs caution suddenly consuming whole milk & cheese
    isn't a good strategy for weight-loss or overall health.
