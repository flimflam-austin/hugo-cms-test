    ============================


    A look at the deal ahead of final votes:

    WHY IT MATTERS:

    ===============


    *   Gov’t funding runs out at midnight on Thursday (2/8).

    *   Stops automatic gov’t spending cuts (aka “sequester”).

    *   Raises gov’t borrowing limit until March 2019 (after this year’s midterm
    elections).

    *   Deal is a rare display of bipartisanship in Congress with each side
    getting a little $omething.
