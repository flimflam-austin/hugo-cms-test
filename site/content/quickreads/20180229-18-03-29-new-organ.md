    New Human Organ?

    ================


    “Interstitium”

    --------------


    Study says its discovered the body’s biggest organ AND it may hold the **key
    to understanding how cancer spreads.**


    But is it really as “new” as reported? **Some say no…they’ve known about it
    for DECADES.**

    including the possibility that the direct sampling of interstitial fluid may
    become a powerful diagnostic tool.”

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    “New” organ = mesh-like fluid-filled spaces that provide both cushion and
    connective tissue to entire body.


    _“Importantly, the finding that this layer is a highway of moving fluid may
    explain why cancer that invades it becomes much more likely to spread.”

    NOT “News” To Some…

    -------------------


    *   **Myofascial Release**: Developed more than 4 decades ago.

    *   Form of body work that targets connective tissue to loosen or “release”
    the fascia for health benefits.

    *   Instead of “interstitium”, therapists call the **entire** network
    “fascia”.

*   **Full Quote from Myofascial Release pioneer John F. Barnes to SmartHer News**:_“It is refreshing to see science is finally catching up to what I’ve been teaching in my Myofascial Release seminars for the last 40 years. A The fascial system is one of the most important structures of our body and is significantly tightened from physical or emotional trauma which produces crushing pressure on pain sensitive structures. A It produces symptoms of pain, headaches, fibromyalgia and a myriad of women’s pain and health problems.__The fascinating fascia is a liquid crystal three dimensional web. A In the space of the web, which is actually not space, but a fluid/viscous substance called the ground substance of the fascia which tends to solidify due to trauma and is the main transport medium of our body. **A This means that whatever nutrition we ingest, the fluid we drink, the air we breathe, all the biochemistry hormones and information/energy that every one of the trillion of cells needs to thrive must go through the fluidity of the fascia**.”__“I would highly recommend purchasing Dr. Jean-Claude Guimberteau’s book, Architecture of Human Living Fascia. He is a French hand surgeon and he represents over 20 years of research on the fascial system. If you go to page 163, I have provided a more detailed explanation of the fascial system and Myofascial Release.”_\-John F. Barnes
