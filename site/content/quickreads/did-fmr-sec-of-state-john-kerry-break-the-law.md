    Why This Matters:

    -----------------


    *   Private American citizens aren’t supposed to communicate with foreign
    officials to influence matters of national importance (“**The Logan Act**“).

    *   **Context:** Some say Mike Flynn, Pres. Trump’s former national security
    advisor, violated the Logan Act when he spoke with the Russian ambassador
    before Trump’s inauguration.

    Logan Act

    ---------


    *   Named for a Pennsylvania Quaker Dr. George Logan, friend of VP Thomas
    Jefferson, who traveled to France in the late 1700s and tried to negotiate
    on behalf of the United States. President John Adams wasn’t happy. Hence, a
    new law.

    *   **No one has ever been convicted of the Logan Act in more than 220
    years.**

This is a former secretary of state engaged with the worlda\x19s largest state sponsor of terror, and according to him a\x13 right? You dona\x19t have to take my word for it….He was talking to them. He was telling them to wait out this administration.”\n> \n> Sec of State Mike Pompeo"

    ----------------


    **Important**: During his presser, Sec. Pompeo squarely blamed Iran for
    firing rockets at America’s embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in
    Basra.


    **What’s Happening**: Iran backs some Iraqi politicians, we support others.
    Iran blames the U.S. for stirring up dissent against the officials they
    support.

    Kerry admitted to speaking to the Iranian Foreign Minister about Yemen,
    Syria, and Iranian backed terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, and
    beyond. He says he has every right to speak to Iranian officials because
    past public officials, like Henry Kissinger, have done the same.
