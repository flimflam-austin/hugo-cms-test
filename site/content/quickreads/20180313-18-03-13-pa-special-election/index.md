    Why is Pennsylvania’s “Special Election”  

    so “special”?

    --------------------------------------------------------


    Voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District will head to the polls
    Tuesday to vote for a new member of Congress…  

    EVEN THOUGH the district will **disappear** after November’s election.

    The Disappearing District

    -------------------------


    In January, Pennsylvania’s highest court ruled the state’s congressional map
    was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander favoring Republicans, and
    ordered lawmakers to draw a new map for all of the state’s 18 congressional
    districts.

    All Eyes on PA-18  

    Why It Matters:

    -----------------------------------


    *   Pennsylvania is a **swing state**.

    *   In 2016, **Trump won** PA-18 by about 20 percentage points.

    *   Even though PA-18’s registered **Democrats outnumber Republicans**, only
    two Dems have held the seat in 100+ years.

    *   **$15.6+ million:** Amount spent by both sides in the surprisingly close
    race.
