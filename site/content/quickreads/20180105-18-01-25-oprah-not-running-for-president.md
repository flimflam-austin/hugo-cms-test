**The singular Oprah Winfrey on braving the elements, the way forward for women, and why, for now at least, she doesna\\u0019t want to be president**

**byA LAURA BROWN**

OW:A \[Laughs\] I actually saw a mug the other daya\\t…a\\tI thought it was a cute mug. All you need is a mug and some campaign literature and a T-shirt. Ia\\u0019ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not. And so ita\\u0019s not something that interests me. I dona\\u0019t have the DNA for it. Gaylea\\u0014who knows me as well as I know myself practicallya\\u0014has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, a\\u001cWhena\\u0019s Oprah going to run?a\\u001d So Gayle sends me these things, and then shea\\u0019ll go, a\\u001cI know, I know, I know! It wouldna\\u0019t be good for youa\\u0014it would be good for everyone else.a\\u001d I met with someone the other day who said that they would help me with a campaign. Thata\\u0019s not for me.
