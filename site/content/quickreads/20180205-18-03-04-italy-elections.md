    Italy Elects New Gov’t  

    Why It Matters

    ---------------------------------------


    *   Italy: European Union (EU) founding member country; symbolic & economic
    importance.

    *   First election in 5 years – will determine gov’t for next 5 years.

    *   No clear winner, but Euroskeptic, anti-establishment parties gained most
    votes, & ruling center-left party lost ground. **This marks a change.**

    Word To Know:  

    “Euroskepticism”

    --------------------------------


    **_Euroskepticism_:**


    Political platform that doubts the benefits of a unified Europe aka “EU” &
    advocates for its dismantling.


    _New York Times:_ “That anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as a strong dose
    of **euroskepticism**, swept Italy this election season.”

    Key Issues: Immigration & the Economy

    -------------------------------------


    **600K** have migrated to Italy since the last election in 2013.


    **8th largest global economy** is growing, but debt is at the 2nd highest
    level in Euro area.

    unemployed.

    No Clear Winner?

    ================


    *   **5-Star movement & Center Right Coalition** win most votes.

    *   Any party or coalition needs more than 40% support to win enough seats
    to govern. **None did.**

    *   Meant to encourage coalition building, but may end in a “hung
    Parliament.”

    *   Experts say 2017 changes to Italy’s election laws make it harder for one
    single party to win.
