    Levi: Jean Make-Over

    --------------------


    *   The rips & holes in your jeans are often done by hand; one pair of jeans
    can take 20 minutes.

    *   Distressing jeans can use 1,000s of chemicals.

    *   Lasers allow last minute fashion design changes.

    *   Shorter production time = Shorter turnaround time to consumers.

    *   Levi says in next 2 years all jeans will use lasers.
