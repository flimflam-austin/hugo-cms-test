    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    *   When we successfully diet, our bodies burn stored fat.

    *   When we stop dieting, our bodies can start storing fat in anticipation
    of being hungry again, instead of burning calories as they come in.

    *   Scientist have discovered a way to potentially “turn off” our bodies’
    desire to store fat after dieting.

    *   Could help with yo-yo dieting and obesity therapies.

    Protein: Potential Link  

    Your Brain & The Scale

    ------------------------------------------------


    > “Manipulating this protein offers the opportunity to trick the brain and
    not replace the lost weight through increased appetite and storage of fat.”
