    NFL: Players Must Stand

    -----------------------


    Days ahead of Memorial Day, NFL announces new policy on national anthem.
    Turns out the \***new**\* policy isn’t really \***new\***A at all.


    Why Now?

    Important Context:

    ------------------


    *   NFL players didn’t always come on the field for the national anthem –
    **only since 2009.**

    *   “New policy” allows players to choose to yet again NOT go on the field
    for the national anthem.

    *   \*If\* on the field, players must **“stand and show respect”** during
    the anthem or **face a league fine & possibly a fine from the team.**

    Why Now?

    --------


    **NFL:**A “It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false
    perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This
    is not and was never the case.”  

    **Something To Consider**: Americans are watching less TV overall & NFL
    viewership has declined by millions since 2015. Some viewers say they
    boycotted the NFL because of the players on-field protests.

    > “This is fear of a diminished bottom line. It’s also fear of a president
    turning his base against a corporation. This is not patriotism. Don’t get it
    confused.”

    > Chris Long, Philadelphia Eagles defensive end, responding to the "new
    policy" via Twitter. Long supports players on-field protests and is an
    outspoken critic of President Trump.

    Different sports have different policies for player etiquette during the
    national anthem. The NBA has a strict one - and Nascar - none at all.

    Despite the NFLa\\u0019s approval of a revised policy thatA requires players on the field to stand during the national anthem, Jets chairman Christopher Johnson told Newsday on Wednesday that his players are free to take a knee or perform some other protest without fear of repercussion from the team.League owners unanimously adopted a policy that allows players who dona\\u0019t want to participate in the anthem to remain in the locker room. Players who do appear on the field for the anthem must stand; if they dona\\u0019t, their respective club faces a league-issued fine and teams can levy additional fines.a\\u001cI do not like imposing any club-specific rules,a\\u001d Johnson said. a\\u001cIf somebody \[on the Jets\] takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players. I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer that they stand? Of course. But I understand if they felt the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that wea\\u0019re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I dona\\u0019t want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I wona\\u0019t. There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, thata\\u0019s just something Ia\\u0019ll have to bear.a\\u001d
