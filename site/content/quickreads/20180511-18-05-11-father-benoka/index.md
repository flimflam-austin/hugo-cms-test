    Why Does This Matter?

    ---------------------


    *   Father Benoka use to live and work in Mosul and survived the ISIS
    invasion. He says Christians \*still\* face the **threat of genocide**.

    *   The **Shiite Muslim** majority govt in Iraq & Iran’s Shiite regime work
    together through “Shiite Militias”.

    *   Benoka says he believes the goal of these Shiite Militias inside Iraq is
    to **push out minorities and claim land for Iran**.

    This unique perspective comes from an area few journalists venture. As focus
    remains on the "Iran Deal" overall, we want to share the experience of
    someone on the ground in the Middle East. It's one story - We look forward
    to telling more.
