    Turns out a prison on an island = EXPEN$IVE

    -------------------------------------------


    *   All food & supplies shipped in.

    *   No fresh water. _(1M gallons of water barged in weekly.)_

    *   **$3-5M** needed just for repairs.

    *   **3 times more expensive** to operate. (_In 1959, the daily cost per
    inmate at Alcatraz was $10.10 vs. $3 at a U.S. prison in Atlanta._)

    *   U.S. Gov’t: more cost effective to close Alcatraz & build new.
