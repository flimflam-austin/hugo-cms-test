    Why It Matters:

    ===============


    *   Iran = State sponsor of terror since 1984 and no friend of the USA.

    *   Iran supports Syria’s Pro-Assad forces – Syria is key territory &
    strategic ally for Iran.

    *   Investigation into crash continues.

    *   If confirmed, this will be first time Israeli plane shot down by enemy
    fire since 1982.
