    “Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree
    from Trump University. He’s playing the American public for suckers: He gets
    a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.”

    2016

    Why It Matters

    ==============


    *   President Trump has repeatedly commented on wanting more Republicans in
    Congress, in part to help the White House agenda.

    *   Romney has a strong chance of keeping a Senate seat held by Republican
    Orin Hatch for 40 years (!) – “Red”.

    *   However, it remains a question if Romney would support President Trump’s
    priorities.
