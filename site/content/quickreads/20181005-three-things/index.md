    WHAT THE FBI’S REPORT SAYS:

    ---------------------------


    *   **We don’t know** and we probably never will because it won’t be made
    public.

    *   FBI’s 1992 report of its investigation into allegations by **Anita
    Hill** into then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas weren’t made public
    either.

    *   **We do know:A** FBI interviewed 9 people.

    WHEN WILL THE SENATE VOTE:

    --------------------------


    *   Wednesday PM, Senate Majority Leader started procedures necessary for a
    final vote.

    *   Friday AM, Senate will vote on cloture (a vote to end debate). If
    passed, Senators can still debate up to 30 hrs before final vote.

    *   Saturday TBD, full Senate will vote on nomination – **51 votes needed to
    confirm nominee.**

    WILL KAVANAUGH GET CONFIRMED:

    =============================


    *   Senate Republicans hold a narrowA 51-49 majority and only a simple
    majority (51) is needed.

    *   That means Kavanaugh will likely be confirmed UNLESS **twoA of the three
    following “undeclared” GOP Senators vote**A against their party:A Susan
    Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), or Jeff Flake (R-AZ).

    If there is a tie in the Senate, the Vice President will cast the deciding
    vote. The Supreme Court nominee wrote an editorial in Friday's Wall Street
    Journal; Time magazine put Christine Blasey Ford on the cover. You can see
    both on our source page.
