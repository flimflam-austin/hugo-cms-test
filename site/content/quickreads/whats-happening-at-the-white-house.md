    Why Timing Matters:

    -------------------


    > _“The high-profile hiring search comes at a pivotal time as the president

    Despite rampant rumors, no official reason was given for Kelly's upcoming
    departure. Widespread speculation aside, the Special Counsel has not
    directly implicated Pres. Trump in any crime or accused him of collusion.
    Investigation continues.
