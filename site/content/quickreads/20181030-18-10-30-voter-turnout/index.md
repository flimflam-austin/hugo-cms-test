  card_text: "Analysts expect a big jump in turnout for 3 reasons:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Turnout tends to jump during a President’s first midterm election.\n*   Turnout during primary elections increased. Ex: 56% more eligible voters voted in this year’s House primary elections compared to 2014.\n*   Voter registration skyrocketed (800,00+ new voters – a record vs. 771,321 in 2016)."
