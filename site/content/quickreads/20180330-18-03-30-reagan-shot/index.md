    “The verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity was a bad verdict.”

    --------------------------------------------------------------------


    Patti Davis, President Reagan’s daughter to NPR in 2015


    In 2016, 34 years after a jury found him insane, a federal judge released
    Hinckley into the custody of his mother after doctors at the mental hospital
    where he lived for decades said he was no longer a threat.

    Jim Brady’s Lasting Legacy

    --------------------------


    After he recovered, Jim & his wife Sarah became advocates for stricter gun
    control laws in the U.S.


    In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Handgun Violence Protection
    Act into law. The Act requires federally licensed firearms dealer (about 60%
    of all gun sales) to conduct background checks of potential gun buyers.

    In 2014, when James Brady died his death was ruled a homicide because he
    died as a result of the injuries he sustained 33 years earlier when he was
    shot, but prosecutors decided against charging Hinckley, and he was released
    just two years later.
