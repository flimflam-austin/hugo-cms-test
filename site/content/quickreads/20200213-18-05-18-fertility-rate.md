    Why It’s Surprising

    -------------------


    Last year, the birthrate even **declined for women in their 30s**, a shocker
    after rates had been rising as more women delayed pregnancy.


    The only group to see a **higher birthrate was women in their 40s**.


    Baby booms typically follow economic booms, but **the fertility rate hasn’t
    recovered since 2010.**

    > “Every year I look at data & expect it will be the year that birthrates
    start to tick up, and every year we hit another all-time low. It’s one of
    the big demographic mysteries of recent times.”

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    Fewer babies means **less young workers to pay into Social Security &
    Medicare** for an aging population.


    It may also affect the workplace with **too few workers for jobs** that need
    to be filled.


    In the U.S., declines in rates haven’t led to drops in population, mainly
    due to immigration.

    More than 3.8M babies were born in the U.S. last year, but last year's drop
    in the nation's birth rate (about 2%) is the largest drop since 2010. And
    while there's no need to be alarmed yet, researchers point to Japan's
    "demographic time bomb" on why this matters. Read more here.

    *   The rate of births to women ages 15 to 44, known as the general fertility rate, sank to a record low of about 60 per 1,000.
    *   Women in their early 40s were the only group with higher birth rates in 2017, up 2 percent from the year. The rate has been rising since the early 1980s.
    *   The cesarean section rate rose by a tiny amount after having decreased four years. Studies have shown C-sections are more common in first-time births involving older moms.
    *   Rates of preterm and low birth weight babies rose for the third straight year, possibly for the same reason.
    *   Birth rates for teens continued to nosedive, as they have since the early 1990s. In 2017, they dropped 7 percent from the year before.
    *   Rates for women in their 20s continued to fall and hit record lows. They fell 4 percent.
    *   Perhaps most surprising, birth rates for women in their 30s fell slightly, dipping 2 percent for women ages 30 to 34 and 1 percent for women 35 to 39.
