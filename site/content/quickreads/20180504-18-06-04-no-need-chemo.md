    Basics of Study

    ---------------


    *   Focus: early stage tumors (before cancer has chance to spread).

    *   Doctors use a genetic test to predict cancer reoccurrence – results
    determine treatment.

    *   Mid-range readings often got recommended chemo & hormone therapy; study
    focused on this group and now challenges the use of chemo.

    *   **70%: NO benefit from chemo.**

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   **Affirmation**: Breast cancer study from 2016 found little difference
    in outcome between patients treated with chemo vs. those without; genetic
    testing on tumor also used to determine treatment.

    *   **One caveat:**A Women under 50 with breast cancer \*may\* benefit from
    chemo, but **docs don’t know why.**

    Some suggest this isn't a move away from simply chemo; but a move toward
    more personalized medicine. The WSJ points out this is part of a trend in
    cancer treatment - that has doctors leaning towards (and proving) less
    invasive care is healthier and less costly.
