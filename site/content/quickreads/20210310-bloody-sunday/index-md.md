    ## The Background 


    * Congress passed the 15th Amendment in 1870 to guarantee that the right to vote “*shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitud*e.” 

    * However, many states passed laws or employed practices that still limited access for some voters – i.e. poll taxes, literacy exams, fraud, and intimidation.

    ## "Bloody Sunday"


    * Approx. 600 nonviolent activists planned to march 54 miles from Selma to Montgomery, AL as a protest for African-American voting rights. 

    * They made it only 6 blocks, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge – where law enforcement ordered the march to stop & disperse. 

    * Armed officers, many in gas masks, beat and tear-gassed protesters. 

    * Photographers captured the violent scene, broadcast around the world.

    > “*Mr. Williams said, ‘Can I have a word?’ He said, ‘There will be no
    word.’ And about a minute or more Major Cloud ordered the Troopers to
    advance … they moved forward with their clubs up over their—near their
    shoulder, the top part of the body; they came rushing in, knocking us down
    and pushing u*s.”


    Congressman John Lewis - a young civil rights leader at the time - led the march with Hosea Williams, a fellow activist.
