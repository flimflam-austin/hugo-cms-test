    Why This Matters

    ----------------


    *   Walmart’s stock can have broad impact – it accounted for a third of the
    Dow’s overall decline Tuesday.

    *   1 of 30 stocks traded on the Dow but its higher stock price means it
    weighs heavier on market overall.

    *   Plus, investors see it as a symbol of America’s economy.

    Why Did This Happen?

    --------------------


    *   eCommerce business increased overall, but not in final months of 2017.

    *   Inventory issues for online sales surfaced during holiday season, i.e.
    gift items squeezed space for basic goods & created problems.

    *   **Bottom Line:** Walmart (world’s largest retailer & America’s largest
    private employer) didn’t meet expectations.
