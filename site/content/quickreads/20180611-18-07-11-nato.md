    > “I agree with you that we have to do make sure that our allies are
    investing more.A The good news is that allies have started to invest more in
    defense. After years of cutting defense budgets, they have started to add
    billions to their defense budgets.A And last year was the biggest increase
    in defense spending across Europe and Canada in that generation.”

    Why Timing Matters?

    -------------------


    *   NATO troops deployed to areas like Poland as a way of countering an
    emboldened Russia (Russia ignored international borders & “took” Crimea from
    Ukraine).

    *   Pres. Trump criticized NATO members (who want protection from Russia)
    AND pointed out their own relationships w/the Kremlin before his mtg
    w/Russian Pres. Putin next week in Helsinki.

    Is NATO worth the investment? One commentator says: "The issue is not
    whether NATO is still useful, but whether the alliance can reform itself
    before it implodes."

*   **Is NATO Worth Preserving? (from 2016)A** The Soviet Union has collapsed, Germany is now in the European Union, and the EU has a larger population and economy that the United States. But Putina\\u0019s Russia is still nuclear and aggressive. It expands anywhere it senses weakness. Germany still earns suspicion in Europe, whether because of Chancellor Angela Merkela\\u0019s destructive immigration policies or the equally unwise practice of rich German banks recklessly lending to bankrupt Mediterranean nations. The European Union never managed to unite its disparate nations into something cohesive and similar to the individual states of America.In sum, a powerful Russia will always have to be watched. A dynamic and headstrong Germany will always have to be integrated into some sort of military alliance. And the United States will always have a natural self-interest in preemptively keeping kindred Europeans from killing each other.The West is increasingly under assault. It is the target of radical Islamic terrorists, it is losing its deterrence with Russia and China, and it is seen as weak by rogue regimes such as Iran and North Korea.The issue is not whether NATO is still useful, but whether the alliance can reform itself before it implodes.
