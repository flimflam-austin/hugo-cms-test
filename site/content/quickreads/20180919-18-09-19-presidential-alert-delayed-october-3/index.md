    What’s Going On?

    ----------------


    FEMA testing a “Presidential Alert” – an announcement from the President for
    use only in the event of **national emergencies**.


    The “text test” was scheduled for THIS Thursday Sept. 20 at 2:18 p.m. EST,
    but **will instead go out on October 3rd** because FEMA says it’s focusing
    on Hurricane Florence recovery.

    Why Now?

    --------


    *   95% of Americans own a cell phone.

    *   Congress authorized “emergency wireless alerts” to communicate with the
    public. Amber alerts for kidnapped children or tornado warnings often use
    this system.

    *   You can opt out of receiving Amber Alerts but NOT for this national
    alert.

    Some argue this is a great tool for communicating with the public during
    dire times; others say it presents a risk for hacking or abuse. Either way,
    this will be the first wireless emergency alert directly from an American
    President.
