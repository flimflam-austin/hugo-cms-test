    September is often the peak of hurricane season, and so far at least, the 2018 season has not shaped up to be nearly as deadly or expensive as 2017, when three immense storms a Harvey, Irma and Maria a assaulted the United States with heavy winds and rains.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration lowered its forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season last month, and said it now expected no more than 13 named storms for the year. In May, forecasters were anticipating as many as 16 named storms. Officially, the Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.
