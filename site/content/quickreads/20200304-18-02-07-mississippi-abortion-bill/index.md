    What Does MS Bill Say?

    ----------------------


    *   Prohibits abortion after 15 weeks.

    *   Abortion only allowed if health of mother is in danger or baby will not
    survive outside the womb after full-term.

    *   Rape or incest NOT exceptions.

    *   Mississippi is 1 of 17 states that doesn’t allow abortions after 20 wks.
    The 15 week “mark” is unprecedented.

    Why Is This Significant  


    --------------------------


    **Supreme Court Showdown In The Making  

    **


    *   Roe V. Wade legalized abortion, but held a woman’s right to an abortion
    is **not absolute**.

    *   States may restrict or ban abortions when a baby can survive outside
    womb (aka legally as “fetal viability”).

    The 15 week mark in Mississippi is why this law is controversial and
    challenges "norms" on when a child can survive outside womb. That medical
    debate has legal implications.
