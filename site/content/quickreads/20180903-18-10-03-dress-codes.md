    WHY?

    ----


    *   School districts following NOW’s guidance say they want to avoid
    inequitable & unnecessary disciplinary measures affecting girls
    disproportionately; **more girls got in trouble than boys.**

    *   CA’s Alameda school district is the latest to adopt a dress code that
    allows items once deemed “too distracting” (ex: short shorts, & midriffs).

Some argued the policy was too vague and enforced differently depending on a student's particular body type (\"body shaming\")."

    that. …. But I think it’s extraordinarily misled.”

    > Marie Hsu, Alameda, CA math teacher and mother of two young children. She
    expressed concern about not enforcing a stricter dress code and whether or
    not that sends the signal to girls that it's okay to "sex it up" or dress
    inappropriately with no accountability.

    Businesses nationwide are also revamping their dress codes to embrace a more
    "gender neutral" approach to avoid gender-based dress codes, especially in
    the wake of the #MeToo movement. Is this a step forward or back?
