    Saving Private Ryan

    ===================


    *   Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks & Matt Damon

    *   Cost $70M, including $12M on Omaha Beach D-Day scene.

    *   Spielberg didn’t use story boards for notorious D-Day scene, relying
    instead on photos & news reels.

    *   The graphic violence nearly earned it an “NC-17” rating and prevented
    Spielberg from letting his 13-year-old son see his film.

    > “The minute we finished the D-Day/Omaha Beach sequence, I knew we had
    something really special to show audiences around the world.A I think all of
    us who worked on that film – from Director Steven Spielberg down to the
    lowliest extra in crowd scenes – can be proud that we had a part in making
    Saving Private Ryan.”

> “When you make something as subjective and perishable as movies or scripted TV shows, being a part of one that rises above the rest and promises to be around for many generations is a remarkable experience.A When a project like that – such as Saving Pvt. Ryan – celebrates the rugged, determined Americans who fought and won World War II, it’s especially rewarding.A You never know when you’re making a movie, how audiences will react.A I didn’t have that problem with SPR.”
