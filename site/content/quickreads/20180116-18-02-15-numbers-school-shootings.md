    Florida Shooting

    ================


    “It is a horrifying statistic. And it is wrong.”

    ------------------------------------------------


    Washington Post calls out statistic generated by anti-gun group that states
    Wednesday’s shooting was the 18th school shooting in the USA this year.

    “This is the 18th school shooting in the U.S. in 2018.”

    -------------------------------------------------------


    *   Nonprofit “Everytown for Gun Safety” tweeted out this statistic.

    *   Everytown counts ANY gun discharge in school or on school property as a
    “school shooting” – even if school is closed, shots are fired accidentally,
    or no one is injured.

    Two Sides

    ---------


    _Everytown_ says any gunfire in school/on school grounds “undermines the
    sense of security’ of students.


    _Washington Post_A says all gun discharges on school grounds are not equal
    and some should not count as a “school shooting” – numbers should not be
    inflated.

    Washington Post Argues:

    -----------------------


    _“The figures matter because gun-control activists use them as evidence in
    their fight for bans on assault weapons, stricter background checks and
    other legislation. Gun rights groups seize on the faults in the data to
    undermine those arguments and, similarly, present skewed figures of their
    own.”_

    Others Agree

    ------------


    “…this play on gun-control emotions is particularly troublesome because it
    takes the spotlight off of what is really worrisome. In this case, the
    shooter was well known to the school, known to the FBI, and known to many
    others as a deranged person with a serious violent streak.So why isn’t the
    focus of the public debate on what went wrong?” _Investors Business Daily_
