    Will the Hits  

    Keep on Coming?

    -------------------------------


    Most analysts still consider this a “normal correction” – not a “bear
    market” with continued selling.


    However, the losses are unsettling after a really strong 2017, the 1st year
    in history where the S&P 500 showed gains EVERY month.
