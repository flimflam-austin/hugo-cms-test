    In 2017, Carey spoke to Billboard about how her modern day Christmas anthem
    almost wasn't. With Christmas still weeks away, the 1994 hit has already
    made its way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Rolling Stone Top
    100. In 2019, it was the most-streamed holiday song with 308.9M audio and
    video streams. Christmas is Mariah's holiday - she recently told WSJ “I
    really do live from Christmas to Christmas."
