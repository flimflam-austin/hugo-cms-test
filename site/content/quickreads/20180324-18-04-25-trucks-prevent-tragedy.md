    Trucks Prevent Tragedy

    ----------------------


    Michigan State Police shut down a highway outside Detroit, asking 13 semi
    trucks to make a “wall” for a man threatening to jump.


    Truckers have helped police in similar situations in the past, but usually
    not in this large of numbers.


    The man, in his 30s, did not to jump and walked to safety.
