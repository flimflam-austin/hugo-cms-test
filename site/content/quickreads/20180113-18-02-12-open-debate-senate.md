    Rare Monday in Senate  

    “Open Debate”

    -------------------------------------


    *   Open Debate = _Just that_

    *   Any senator can bring legislation or amendments for consideration.

    *   Why now? **IMMIGRATION**

    *   Why It Matters? Coming off last week’s compromise on a budget bill,
    Senate \*could\* continue bipartisanship on immigration reform.

    Important To Know:

    ==================


    *   President Obama used executive action to create DACA.

    *   President Trump can use executive action to rescind DACA.

    *   Both sides arguably use DACA as bargaining for larger immigration
    reform.

    *   Congress originates laws – For immigration reform to last, it needs to
    come from Congress.
