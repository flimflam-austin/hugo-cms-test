    Impressive Performance

    ----------------------


    UMBC jumped out early & never trailed Virginia in the 2nd half.


    Stunning not only that they won, but how certain the outcome was for the
    last 15 mins of the game.


    At 11:06ET UMBC’s website crashed.


    @UMBCAthletics gained 13K Twitter followers in last 2 mins of game.
