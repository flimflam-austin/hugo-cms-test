    The Great Straw Debate
    ----------------------

    First, plastic bags.  
    Now, plastic straws?  
    Straw bans span coast to coast, but stir up questions.

    Why Now?

    Why Hate On Straws?

    -------------------


    > “Straws are a luxury, we do not need straws to have our drinks, and I
    think it’s an easy step forward where we can have a great impact for our
    environment.”

    > 

    > Brooklyn City Councilman Rafael Espinal who introduced a straw ban for
    America's largest city in late May, following previous official bans in
    Seattle, Oakland & Miami Beach.

    Impact? Data Debate

    -------------------


    *   You’ll see this number A LOT: **Americans use an est. 500,000,000 straws
    a day** (that would mean every single American uses more than 1 straw a
    day).

    *   **That estimate is based on a 9-year-old’s research project.**

    *   Whatever the number, debate continues on whether straws are public enemy
    #1 for pollution.

    The Last Straw?

    ---------------


    *   Straw ban part of renewed focus on reducing plastic in the ocean. 60-80%
    of all marine debris is composed of plastic: WCS.

    *   Study looking at efficacy of general plastic bans says **initial results
    encouraging,** but **more research needed**.

    *   Other study: fishing gear, balloons & plastic bags = biggest threat to
    ocean life, doesn’t name straws.

    The patent for the first straw was approved in 1888, but a patent for
    "drinking tubes" for disabled Americans came before that - another argument
    against the straw ban is it will hurt the disabled who depend on straws to
    drink.
