Jonathan Schanzer to SmartHER News:A _Turkey is a NATO ally and a traditional buffer between the West and the Middle East. And it has been extremely useful in this regard in terms of helping us keep the US-led order in the Middle East. Over the last decade, however, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country has become increasingly radical and anti-American. We are watching our alliance with the crucial country unravel in real time. And **we may also be watching Turkey switch sides from America to Team Russia and Iran.A [http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/schanzer-jonathan/](\"http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/schanzer-jonathan/\")**_
