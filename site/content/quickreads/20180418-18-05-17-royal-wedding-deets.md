*   **Why Prince Harry & Megan Markle Plan to Delay Their Honeymoon:**

    _If that wasn’t enough, Kensington Palace is also confirming that Harry and Meghan will not be going on their honeymoon, which will reportedly be at a luxury tented camp in Namibia, as quickly as most couple’s head off. Traditionally, newlyweds honeymoon almost immediately after a fabulous send-off after their wedding’s evening reception, but Harry and Meghan have their first official engagement as a married couple just days after their nuptials._
