    All About Acrylamide:

    ---------------------


    *   Studies on mice show acrylamide exposure increases risk for some types
    of cancer; **findings from human studies are inconsistent.**

    *   EPA watches & regulates this chemical in drinking water.

    *   Found in **plastics**, grouts, **cosmetics**, & cigarette smoke.

    *   Found in foods like **fries**, potato chips, crackers, cookies, cereals,

    has been on California's Prop 65 list of chemicals since 1990) in coffee
    isn't harmful and that any risks are outweighed by coffee's benefits. Read
