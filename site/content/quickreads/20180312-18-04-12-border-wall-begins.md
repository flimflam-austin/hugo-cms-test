    IS IT A FENCE OR A WALL?

    ------------------------


    > Controversy over if this in fact the “big, beautiful” border wall Pres.
    Trump promised — or not.

    > 

    > Currently, 1/3 of the border has a barrier that **up until Monday was
    called a “fence”** by Border Patrol.

    > This new 20-mile stretch is being **called a “wall”** **by Border
    Patrol**A despite it being **the exact same structure used previously**.
