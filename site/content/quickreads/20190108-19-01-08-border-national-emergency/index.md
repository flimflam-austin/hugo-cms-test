    =================


    **“_I can do it if I want… We can call a national emergency and build it
    very quickly_.”**


    A president can declare a national emergency – **EVERY president since 1976
    has done so –**A \*BUT\* may President Trump do so in order to fund a border
    wall?


    What To Know

    The **1976 National Emergencies Act** allows a president to declare an
    emergency in order to, among other things:


    *   take property & commodities

    *   limit travel & prohibit trade

    *   invoke martial law & send troops


    The Act does NOT define “national emergency.”A The president must use
    existing laws to do so.

    Presidential Power Limits

    -------------------------


    *   The president must identify an **existing law** to invoke the emergency
    power (example: use the legal definition of an “immigration emergency” to
    make his case).

    *   Emergencies **expire** after one year UNLESS renewed.

    *   Emergency can be rescinded any time via a **joint resolution** passed by
    both houses of Congress.

    BOTTOM LINE: Yes, it is within President Trump's legal authority to declare
    a national emergency without Congressional approval, \*HOWEVER\* if he does
    so in order to build a border wall, he is all but guaranteed to face a legal
    challenge.
