*   **NYSE’s first female president points to gender diversity problem:** [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/nyses-first-female-president-points-to-gender-diversity-problem.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/nyses-first-female-president-points-to-gender-diversity-problem.html)
*   **Stacey Cunningham: feeling the heat on the trading floor & in the kitchen:** [https://www.ft.com/content/58a80dd4-5089-11e7-bfb8-997009366969](https://www.ft.com/content/58a80dd4-5089-11e7-bfb8-997009366969)  
    _She refers to Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the NYSE, which allowed her to trade on the floor. If she hadn”t done that, if she hadn”t said, “I”m not allowed to be there, but I am going to just go do it anyway”, I never would have been able to walk on the trading floor without thinking about it. And I never gave it a thought. Later that evening, Cunningham will take me to a room at the exchange named after Siebert, who died in 2013. Among the items showcased there are a photograph of women trading on the floor during the second world war and Siebert”s trading floor jacket, made of multicoloured fur. When she bought her seat in 1967, there was no ladies” bathroom in the luncheon club, the members-only space that encompassed the entire seventh floor. The exchange ultimately made one for her by converting a telephone booth. (It was still there when Cunningham left in 2005.)_
