    Backwards Training 101

    ----------------------


    *   Started running 0.5 mile backwards last summer, slowly increasing run
    lengths.

    *   Ran 7 marathons _forwards_, qualifying him for Boston.

    *   Trains on treadmills (which he says can be pretty boring) & in parks
    (looking out for obstacles).

    *   During Boston Marathon, he’ll have a spotter to help him avoid spills or
    running into other people.

    How Hard Is Running Backwards Anyway?

    -------------------------------------


    > _“SOOOO much harder!A It’s definitely not an efficient way of human
    movement.A You use your calves, quads and glutes so much more than forwards
    running.A You also use up a ton more energy.A I can’t stop eating!”_
