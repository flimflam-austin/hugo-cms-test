    Exact Origin?  

    No One Knows For Sure

    -------------------------------------


    > “This custom started in medieval times…people often concealed weapons in
    their hands. The handshake was a way of affirming that neither you nor the
    person you were greeting was carrying anything intended to harm.”

    Do We Shake Hands…

    What makes a good handshake?

    ----------------------------


    > “In North America and Europe, a firm handshake is an appropriate form of
    greeting. In Asia and the Middle East the customary grip is gentler; a
    too-hearty grip could be interpreted as aggressive.”
