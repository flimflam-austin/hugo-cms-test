* **Crowley and Grimm crash: Top takeaways from Tuesday”s primaries ~A**

_The 2020 Democratic landscape gets some early definition._  
_After then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor”s 2014 defeat in a Republican primary in Virginia, some predicted a tidal wave of anti-incumbent sentiment that would reshape the Republican Party._

_In the end, only two other House GOP incumbents lost: Ralph Hall of Texas, who was 90 years old when he was narrowly defeated in a GOP primary runoff, and Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan, the eccentric reindeer rancher whose brother told reporters that he was mentally imbalanced._

_While Republican primary voters didn”t sweep out incumbent members by the score, they did sweep in Trump during the next presidential primary, rejecting a dozen other candidates with sterling political rA(C)sumA(C)s in favor of a first-time candidate who appealed to their emotions._

_It”s against this backdrop that Ocasio-Cortez”s victory on Tuesday could be the most significant moment in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination thus far. Crowley, a white man who began his congressional career in the late 1990s as a centrist, New Democrat (though he was more reliably liberal in recent years), lost to a 28-year-old Latina — a first-time candidate who describes herself as a Democratic socialist and favors single-payer health care._

_Sanders, rejected in the primaries in New York two years ago, was quick toA embraceA Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday night, suggesting her campaign focused on some of the same themes his did in 2016. Former HUD Secretary JuliA!n Castro was also quick out of the gate toA congratulateA her._
