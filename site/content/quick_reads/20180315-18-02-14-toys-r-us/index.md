      ====================

      ## Toys ‘R’ Us Is Closing

      > ‘We’re putting a for sale sign on everything.’

      ## What It Means:


      * **33,000** U.S. workers to lose jobs.

      * Potentially **700 stores closing** in America; including Babies ‘R’ Us.

      * CNBC reports **200 U.S. stores may be spared** in a deal that would also
      sell off its Canadian locations.

      * During the holidays, Toys R Us employs over **100,000 workers**.

      ‘The last six months have been pure hell.”


      * CEO as quoted by WSJ in a conf. call to employees Wednesday.

      * Toys ‘R’ Us filed for bankruptcy protection in Sept. 2017. The goal was
      to emerge with fewer stores & less debt so it could better fight rivals.

      * Instead, THIS is how the CEO describes the company’s fight for survival.

      # Why This Matters


      ## U.S. Toy Industry = $27B


      * Toys ‘R’ Us = **2nd largest** U.S. toy retailer, represents **15% of
      sales**.

      * But, you guessed it, **Amazon is #1** as more shop online.

      * Lesson in debt: Toys ‘R’ Us had billions in debt – couldn’t invest in
      changes to help it modernize.

      * Major fallout for Mattel, Hasbro & smaller toy makers.

      ## The American Dream:


      * Toys ‘R’ Us founder Charles Lazarus dreamed of having a store of his own
      when he went to visit his dad’s bike shop.

      * **1948:** When Lazarus returned from fighting in WWII, he opened a
      children’s furniture store in D.C., just as the Baby Boom began.

      * **1950s:** Expanded to toys, built store to look like the cutting-edge
      “self-service” supermarkets.
