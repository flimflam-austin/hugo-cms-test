      Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase CEO, before backtracking soon after saying he
      shouldn't have said it. I'm not running for President. Dimon, a lifelong
      Democrat, is one only 2 Wall Street CEO still in place since the financial
      crisis. He has said he would like running the country, but it is unlikely
      a rich banker would win over the liberal Democrats.

      Jim Bridenstine, NASA administrator, on the possibilities of corporate
      sponsorship for NASA missions, including branding on rockets and the

      interest between private companies & public interest and may violate
      NASA's own rules.
