      > “I knew it was going to be a dogfight. It’s just a way of God basically

      # “Hyper Magenta”


      ## New Marketing Strategy


      * According to WSJ, Nike decided sponsored golfers would wear the same hue
      during The Masters.

      * That meant bitter rivals sported the same color shirt (or “hyper
      magenta” -A _Golf Week_) on the same day while battling for the
      championship.
