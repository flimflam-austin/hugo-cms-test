      It Wasn’t Always  

      Memorial Day…


      * Tradition dates back to Civil War.

      * Leader of veterans group proclaimed May 30th – **Decoration Day** – a
      day to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice by decorating soldiers’
      graves **with flowers**.

      * May 30th chosen reportedly because flowers bloomed nationwide.

      According to lore, a group of women visiting a cemetery to decorate the
      graves of Confederate soldiers, saw neglected graves of Union soldiers and
      decided to place flowers on ALL the graves despite the war ending a year
      earlier.

* **Difference between Memorial Day & Veterans Day**:A [https://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetday_faq.asp](https://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetday_faq.asp)Q. What is the difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day?A. Many people confuseA Memorial DayA and Veterans Day. Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. While those who died are also remembered,A Veterans DayA is the day set aside to thank and honorA ALL those who served honorably in the military – in wartime or peacetime. In fact, Veterans Day is largely intended to thankA LIVING veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served – not only those who died – have sacrificed and done their duty.
