      ## UFC President Dana White called it “the most disgusting thing that has
      ever happened in history of the company.”


      McGregor & his entourage attacked a bus full of fighters, throwing chairs,
      trash cans, and anything else that wasn’t pinned down, injuring several
      fighters and bystanders.

      Will Face Charges…  

      Instead Of A Comeback.

      Although McGregor (21-3) hasn't fought in the UFC since he won the
      lightweight belt in November 2016, he reportedly made $140M from his
      August 2017 boxing match against Floyd Mayweather.
