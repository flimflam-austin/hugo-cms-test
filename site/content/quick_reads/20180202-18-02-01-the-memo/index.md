      # Bottom Line Analysis


      > “The memo is not a “dud,” but while it confirms anti-trump bias at top
      of FBI/DOJ (which we already knew/suspected) not sure that makes it a
      “smoking gun” either.”

      # The President Says


      “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice
      Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of
      Democrats and against Republicans – something which would have been
      unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!”

1. **Read the unredacted Nunes memo**: http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20180129/106822/HMTG-115-IG00-20180129-SD001.pdf
2. **Trump nears decision on releasing GOP Russia memo (AP)**  
Democrats have called the memo a cherry-picked list of GOP talking points that attempts to distract from the committee”s own investigation into Russian meddling in the election that sent Trump to the White House. They have prepared their own memo in response, but Republicans voted to block its immediate public release.  
The drama comes as special counsel Robert Mueller also is investigating whether the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia during the campaign and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry by, among other actions, firing Comey. Republicans have intensified their pressure on the Justice Department as Mueller”s probe has moved closer to Trump”s inner circle.  
Trump has been telling confidants in recent days that he believes the memo will validate his concerns that the FBI and Justice Department conspired against him, according to one outside adviser familiar with those conversations but not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.A [https://apnews.com/a93bad5f2d964cf7ad7231eeb80a9a42/FBI-in-public-fight-with-Trump-over-releasing-Russia-memo](https://apnews.com/a93bad5f2d964cf7ad7231eeb80a9a42/FBI-in-public-fight-with-Trump-over-releasing-Russia-memo)
3. **PRESS RELEASE: DEVIN NUNES:** Regardless, it”s clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign. Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again.A A [https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854](https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854)
4. **EDITORIAL: ADAM SCHIFF**  
On Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) moved to release a memo written by his staff that cherry-picks facts, ignores others and smears the FBI and the Justice Department — all while potentially revealing intelligence sources and methods. He did so even thoughA he had not readA the classified documents that the memo characterizes and refused to allow the FBI to brief the committee on the risks of publication and what it has described as material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo”s accuracy. The party-line vote to release the Republican memo but not a Democratic response was a violent break from the committee”s nonpartisan tradition and the latest troubling sign that House Republicans are willing to put the president”s political dictates ahead of the national interest.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rep-nuness-memo-crosses-a-dangerous-line/2018/01/31/cbdabedc-0696-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html?utm_term=.d6bc4bbd2000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rep-nuness-memo-crosses-a-dangerous-line/2018/01/31/cbdabedc-0696-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html?utm_term=.d6bc4bbd2000)
