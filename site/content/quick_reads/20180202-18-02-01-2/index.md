**Whatever happens with the memo, Devin Nunes and Adam Schiff should step down from the House Intelligence Committee**  
byA Tom RoganA |A Feb 1, 2018, 4:33 PM

For a start, the issues that the committee oversees are gravely serious. Their task includes the monitoring of U.S. and foreign intelligence activities at home and abroad, and consideration of how intelligence is collected. Members are also briefed on information provided byA allied intelligence servicesA who trust the United States to keep their secrets safe.

For all these reasons, bipartisan collaboration is crucial if a committee is to do its job effectively.

But that’s not what’s happening in the House.

On the contrary, as the memo saga rumbles on, Nunes is weaponizing his agenda at the behest of the president and Schiff is running from one cable news studio to another, preaching the death of the republic. Moreover, seeing as Nunes and Schiff represent their committee on the so-called “gang of eight” covert action committee, their partisanship could jeopardize the nation’s most closely guarded secrets.A [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/whatever-happens-with-the-memo-devin-nunes-and-adam-schiff-should-step-down-from-the-house-intelligence-committee/article/2647866](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/whatever-happens-with-the-memo-devin-nunes-and-adam-schiff-should-step-down-from-the-house-intelligence-committee/article/2647866)
