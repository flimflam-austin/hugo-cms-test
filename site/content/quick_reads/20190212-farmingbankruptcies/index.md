      # Hurt In The Heartland


      From meat to milk and the vegetables in between, more American farmers
      filed for bankruptcy last year than during the financial crisis a decade
      ago.


      Why Now?

      Kirk Duensing, Nebraska Farmer, who says low prices for soy & corn crops
      combined with high interest loans has left him more than $1M in debt. He
      has sold land and equipment to try to stay afloat.

      # Why Now?


      * **Oversupply** of crops (at home & overseas) fuels lower prices.

      * **High Debt** – Farmers currently carrying the highest debt in 4 decades
      (in part because of borrowing to cover several years of low crop prices).

      * **Trade**: Tariffs (or taxes) on American grown crops exported to China
      or Mexico hurts farmers on top of the depressed prices.

      dispute happened and that really put a damper on things.’  
        
        
        
      Curt Hudnutt, Head of Rural Banking for Rabobank, one of the biggest U.S.
      farm lenders, warning bankruptcies among U.S. farmers will increase. The
      majority of farms lost money last year.

      ## Why It Matters:


      **Your Kitchen Table**: _“…bankruptcies are climbing across swaths of the
      Midwest that produce much of the nation’s grain and meat.”_ (WSJ)


      **Your Tax Dollars**: Pres. Trump created a $12B fund to help subsidize
      farmers impacted by trade disputes. Only a portion of the funds have been
      accessed.

      The downward trend in prices is predicted to continue for U.S. farmers.
      U.S. Treasury Sec. Mnuchin is in China today, where he will continue trade
      talks this week ahead of the March 2nd deal deadline for the two sides to
      set new terms or continue the trade war.
