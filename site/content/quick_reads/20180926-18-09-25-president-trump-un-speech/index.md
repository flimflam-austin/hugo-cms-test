      > “The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have
      embezzled billions of dollars from Iran’s treasury, seized valuable
      portions of the economy, and looted the people’s religious endowments, all
      to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war. **Not
      good**.”

      > “OPEC and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the
      world, and I don’t like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of these
      nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high
      oil prices. **Not good.**“  
        
        
        
      Pres. Trump referred to America as the largest energy producer anywhere on
      the face of the Earth - a fact that U.S. oil production now outpaces all
      other nations.

      ## What To Know:


      * OPEC = Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

      * Members like Saudi Arabia & Russia supply nearly 50% of total world’s
      oil supply.

      * OPEC “stabilizes” oil markets by agreeing to certain production output;
      that supply impacts price.

      * Pres. Trump wants OPEC to keep oil supply up, so prices stay down.
      **OPEC may not agree**.

      ## Connecting The Dots


      * Iran is part of OPEC.

      * Expected U.S. sanctions will prevent some Iranian oil from hitting the
      market.

      * Less global supply = potentially higher oil prices.

      * Higher oil prices may impact U.S. economy. This is why Pres. Trump wants
      OPEC to ramp up production, in part, to cover U.S.-imposed loss of Iranian
      oil.
