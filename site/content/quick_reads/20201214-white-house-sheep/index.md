      ## The Backstory


      * In 1918, President Wilson had sheep brought to the White House as a way
      to exemplify a model American family in helping WWI efforts.

      * The sheep saved money and manpower – “maintaining” the White House.

      * At the flock’s peak, 48 sheep grazed throughout the back and front
      lawns.

      > “The sight of sheep grazing on the South Lawn of the White House may
      seem unusual, but during World War I, it was a highly visible symbol of
      home front support of the troops overseas.”

      ## Why Sheep?


      * In addition to their contributions as “landscapers,” the sheep’s wool
      raised money for the Red Cross.

      * Wool was auctioned off and raised over $50,000 for the organization’s
      war aid.

      * In 2018, a woman donated the wool her father had bought during the
      auction. It had been kept in a safety deposit box for 100 years. It can
      now be seen at Woodrow Wilson’s Presidential Library & Museum.

      According to reports in the Washington Post, the sheep had eaten down the
      White House grass, fell ill during the flu pandemic and developed a fear
      of the growing number of cars passing by, which added to the challenges of
      keeping them; they "retired" in 1920.
