      ## Who & What


      **Who**: Aaron Burr was Vice President of the United States under Pres.
      Jefferson. Alexander Hamilton was a “Founding Father,” the first U.S.
      Treasury Secretary and a powerful political figure. Both veterans of the
      Revolutionary War.


      **What**: A duel. Dueling was illegal in New York and New Jersey, but NJ
      had a reputation for more leniency.

      ## Where & When


      **Where**: Weehawken, New Jersey (across the Hudson River from New York
      City) in the early hours of July 11th, 1804


      **When**: Each man left New York City from separate docks at 5 a.m.. Four
      men rowed them across the Hudson River.

      ## Why?


      * No one knows why **specifically**.

      * Over the years, their political differences put them on a collision
      course. Hamilton supported Jefferson who defeated Burr for the presidency.
      Hamilton also supported Burr’s opponent for NY governor.

      * Reportedly one particularly bad insult by Hamilton about Burr at a
      dinner sparked the face-off, but the exact comment remains a mystery.

      ## The Night Before


      > “But you had rather I should die inno⟨c⟩ent than live guilty. … God’s
      Will be done. The will of a merciful God must be good.”  
        
      Alexander Hamilton to his wife, Elizabeth (Eliza) the night before his
      duel to Aaron Burr, where he insinuates he doesn’t want to kill Burr.
      Conflicting accounts exist of who shot first and whether Hamilton missed
      on purpose.

      ## The Day After


      * Alexander Hamilton dies at 2 pm on July 12th.

      * Benjamin Moore, Episcopal bishop of New York delivered communion to him
      before his death.

      * Moore wrote an account that evening, relaying Hamilton said before he
      died: _“I have no ill will against Col. Burr. I met him with a fixed
      resolution to do him no harm. I forgive all that happened.”_

      > “Let those who are disposed to justify the practice of duelling, be
      induced, by this simple narrative, to view with abhorrence that custom
      which has occasioned in irreparable loss to a worthy and most afflicted
      family: which has deprived his friends of a beloved companion, his
      profession of one of its brightest ornaments, and his country of a great
      statesman and a real patriot.”

      Burr continued to serve as VP until 1805 and was never convicted for the
      crime. 200 years later, a Broadway musical "Hamilton" put the two men back
      in the spotlight again in their former home of New York City. Hamilton,
      the musical, just debuted on Disney's streaming service.

_“Give me the steady, uniform, unshaken security of constitutional freedom. Give me the right to be tried by a jury of my own neighbors, and to be taxed by my own representatives only. What will become of the law and courts of justice without this? The shadow may remain, but the substance will be gone. I would die to preserve the law upon a solid foundation; but take away liberty, and the foundation is destroyed.” Alexander Hamilton_
