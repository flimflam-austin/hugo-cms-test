      If you have an under-vaccinated population, and you introduce a measles

      Clark County Public Health Director Alan Melnick on a measles outbreak

      Republican issue, and we’re finding out today it’s a human issue.”


      Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), the Senate's only black Republican, as Virginia's
      AG, third in line for Governor, admitted to dressing up in blackface in

      democratic leadership, after the Governor admitted to wearing blackface in
      the 1980s & the Lt. General was accused of sexual assault in 2004 - a
      charge he denies.

      Gen. Votel says his duty now is to execute those orders, but added he
      isn't under pressure to leave by a certain date.

      those who promoted #Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry
      it out safely.”

      insisting it will not renegotiate a deal to allow Britain to leave the EU
      next month. Without a deal, both sides warn of "considerable disruption."
      UK PM Theresa May is in Brussels today for a series of meetings with EU
      officials, including Tusk.

      ceremony will go without an official host for the first time in 30 years.
