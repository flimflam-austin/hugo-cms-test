      ## The Findings:


      * Catholic school students are **less disruptive**, exhibited **more
      self-control** and **respect** than public AND private school students.

      * One Disclaimer: _“Families who send their children to Catholic schools
      make a conscious choice to do so, they likely differ from other families
      in unobservable ways.”_

      ## Big Picture


      * Current Education Debate: **Should we approach school discipline
      differently?** Especially becauseA of “differential suspension rates for
      minority and non-minority students”?

      * Study accounted for “race, gender, socioeconomic status, & family
      immigrant status” & arrived at same result. The authors have a few
      theories as to why.

      > “Perhaps students are more likely to internalize such values when they
      know **they are loved not only by their teachers but by their Creator,**
      or when they perceive that misbehavior may have **eternal consequences**.
      Maybe it’s something else entirely.”

      Regardless, one thing is certain: Religion can mold hearts and minds in
      ways that suspensions, restorative justice, and Positive Behavioral
      Intervention and Supports (PBIS) can’t begin to match. Do you agree or
      disagree? Read more:

T_hat doesn”t mean that such secular approaches—and schools—don”t have their place. Of course they do. And so do character education, ethics classes, and civics, all of which can contribute to the development of self-discipline. School leaders should choose the options that best suit their kids and culture._  
_That said, our results suggest that Catholic schools in particular are doing something meaningful in the realm of self-discipline. So it”s deeply unfair that the politics of education continue to prevent many parents from accessing them, and it”s a tragedy for the nation that many of these valuable educational institutions continue to close. To the extent that school choice programs can widen access to great schools—Catholic or otherwise—that boost academic performance and self-discipline, they deserve our eternal support._
