      ## Top Lawmakers React To Florida Shooting


      Gun Law Debate Reemerges


      Simply put the debate focuses on “**Quality vs Quantity**.”


      Does America not have _enough_ gun laws? Or is this a quality issue –
      existing laws are flawed or are not properly enforced?

      > “From early reporting, we understand there may be some mental issues
      with this shooting. So, the question is, “Are those laws where they need
      to be?”

      “.@SpeakerRyan, there are any number of ways we could anticipate & prevent
      gun violence. There is no doubt in my mind that if legislation to expand
      background checks came to a vote, it would pass with bipartisan support.
      #EnoughIsEnough”


      House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) Twitter Feb 15, 2018

      “I’m deeply saddened by the horrific violence in Florida. Praying for the
      victims, their families, and the Parkland community. Always grateful for
      first responders who charge into harm’s way.”


      Senator Mitch McConnell, Twitter, Feb 14, 2018

      “Another shooting in our schools, today at Stoneman Douglas High School in
      Parkland, Florida. Yes, our children are resilient, but this is not a
      burden they should ever have to bear. My heart aches for these children &
      their families. #StopGunViolence”


      Senator Chuck Schumer, (D-NY) Twitter, Feb 14, 2018
