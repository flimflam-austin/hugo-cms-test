      More than fifty years before the U.S. Constitution was amended to
      guarantee women equal voting rights, Wyoming granted women the right to
      vote on this day in 1869.

      ## Women’s Suffrage In WY


      * Wyoming was still a territory in 1869 when a bill was signed into law
      granting women the right to vote, sit on juries, and hold public office.

      * Some lawmakers didn’t take the bill seriously; others saw it as way to
      increase population in the new territory.

      * When WY applied for statehood in 1889, the legislature said it would
      rather stay out of the Union for 100 years than join without voting rights
      for women.

      ## Why?


      * No one really knows why Wyoming took a stand on women suffrage.

      * Many historians credit Esther Hobart Morris. As a young widow and
      mother, she quickly realized the societal and legal constraints for women
      in America.

      * After she remarried and moved to the Wyoming territory, she reportedly
      advocated for women’s voting rights; she soon became the territory’s first
      female justice of the peace.

      ## Name To Know:  

      Louisa Swain


      * On September 6, 1870 in Laramie, WY, the nearly 70-year-old became the
      FIRST woman to legally vote in the U.S. since 1807, when New Jersey
      rescinded women’s voting rights.

      * Swain beat #2 (a 27-year-old) to the polls by 30 minutes.

      * In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution proclaiming September 6th
      as “Louisa Swain Day.”

      ## Big Picture


      * Fighting for a woman’s right to vote happened on *both* state & fed
      levels.

      * Before the 19th Amendment passed in 1920 granting women the right to
      vote in all (federal, state & local) elections, 15 states allowed women to
      vote in state elections and 12 had laws allowing women to vote for
      president.

      * Women in 21 states gained the right to vote as a result of the 19th
      Amendment.

      December 10 is "Wyoming Day" to honor the first of many achievements
      toward women's equality in the Equality State. Wyoming, which is also home
      to the U.S.’s first female governor, elected its first female U.S. senator
      last month -- Republican Cynthia Lummis.
