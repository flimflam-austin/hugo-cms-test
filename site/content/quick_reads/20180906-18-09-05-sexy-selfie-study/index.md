      ## Selfie Study


      * Researchers looked at social media posts in 183 countries.

      * **Results:** More “sexy selfies” come from places, like U.S., where
      women have more opportunities.

      * **Why?** Researchers say areas with greater upward mobility often have
      higher income inequality.

      * Analysis:A **Sexy selfies “sell”**; reflect desire to climb in social
      status.

      > ‘So, when a young woman adjusts her bikini provocatively with her phone
      at the ready, don’t think of her as vacuous or as a victim. Think of her
      as a strategic player in a complex social and evolutionary game. She’s out
      to maximise her lot in life, just like everyone.’

      What Do Men  

      Have To Do With It?


      **Not as much as you might think.**


      Study: Women post more sexy selfies in countries with **less gender
      discrimination**.


      Researchers: sexy selfies play to primitive instincts of **women to
      compete with other women**,A for higher status, and finding a mate.

      "In evolutionary terms, these kinds of behaviors are completely rational,
      even adaptive. The basic idea is that the way people compete for mates,
      and the things they do to put themselves at the top of the hierarchy are
      really important." Read more about the study here:
