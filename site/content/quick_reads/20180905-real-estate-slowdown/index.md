      ## Cause For Concern?


      * **High Home Prices:** Median cost of U.S. homes was up 6.2% in June vs.
      last year – a lower gain from the previous month.

      * **Rising Mortgage Rates:** 30-year fixed 4.5% vs. 4% at start of 2018.

      * **Homebuilding Slows:A** hit a 9-month low in July and has yet to
      significantly rebound.

      * **Fewer Foreign Buyers:** Overseas purchases down a record 21%.
