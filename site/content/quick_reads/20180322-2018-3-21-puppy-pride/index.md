      # PETA isn’t Happy


      > ‘Designating a specific breed as Ohio’s state dog would increase the
      demand for purebred dogs and entice puppy mills to churn out litters of
      them.”

      # Ohio’s “Lab” Test


      Should the bill become law, Ohio will become the 13th state to have a
      state dog, and the first to recognize the Labrador.


      In 2015, Maine also proposed to recognize the Labrador as its state dog,
      but it was rejected.


      do you have a state dog?
