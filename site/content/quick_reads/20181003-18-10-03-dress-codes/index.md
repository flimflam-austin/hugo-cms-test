      ## WHY?


      * School districts following NOW’s guidance say they want to avoid
      inequitable & unnecessary disciplinary measures affecting girls
      disproportionately; **more girls got in trouble than boys.**

      * CA’s Alameda school district is the latest to adopt a dress code that
      allows items once deemed “too distracting” (ex: short shorts, & midriffs).

      > “because more of the policy was focused on girls’ clothing than boys,
      girls were being sent out of the classroom for infractions more often than
      boys, which meant they were losing more class time than their male
      peers.”  
        
        
        
      Alameda, California Unified School District on why it changed its dress
      code policy. Some argued the policy was too vague and enforced differently
      depending on a student's particular body type (body shaming).

      > “It’s good not to punish girls for being distractions. I fully, fully
      get that. …. But I think it’s extraordinarily misled.”  
        
        
        
      Marie Hsu, Alameda, CA math teacher and mother of two young children. She
      expressed concern about not enforcing a stricter dress code and whether or
      not that sends the signal to girls that it's okay to "sex it up" or dress
      inappropriately with no accountability.

      Businesses nationwide are also revamping their dress codes to embrace a
      more "gender neutral" approach to avoid gender-based dress codes,
      especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Is this a step forward or
      back?
