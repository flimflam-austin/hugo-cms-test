      ## Why It Matters


      * California: **world’s 5th largest economy**, others may follow suit.

      * Female quotas exist in European countries like Norway, Germany &
      France;A **CA law is a 1st for U.S**.

      * 25% of California’s publicly heldA corporations don’t have women on
      their boards.

      * Several studies point to better company performance with females on the
      board.

      > ‘I’m not at all convinced it would pass legal muster. …you are saying
      you need to single out women and get them on boards. The question is can
      you make that preference & will it hurt men?’  
        
        
        
      Jessica Levinson, Loyola Law School professor, on why the new California
      law may be vulnerable to a court challenge. Critics argue it may lead to
      unqualified candidates receiving the role, simply due to their gender.
      That said, several studies point to better company performance with
      females on the board.

      ## Something to Consider


      80% of the largest 3,000 companies headquartered in California are
      incorporated (formed) in Delaware.


      Critics of California’s new law say corporations are governed by laws of
      the state in which they are incorporated, not where the main office is
      based – and this law will cause confusion & unnecessary fines.

      Companies like Apple & Facebook don't yet meet the requirement, set to
      take effect in the coming years. What do you think of this new law? A
      precedent or a problem?
