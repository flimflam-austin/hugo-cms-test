      > ‘Classical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies
      all of it. But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into
      something.’  
        
        
        
      Susanne Bier, Bird Box Director, on the film's unconventional success

      ## Why It Matters


      * Attendance in movie theaters is down.A Netflix’s foray into movies still
      new, but will couch viewership compete with theaters?

      * Film originally panned by movie critics.

      * Earned “R-rating” in theater, but no constraints in viewers’ homes.

      * Many artists rebuff Netflix, wanting a widespread theater release. **Is
      this a game changer?**

      Netflix is eyeing the music industry, recently adding "Springsteen on
      Broadway" & Taylor Swift's "Reputation" concert to its offerings. Resale
      tickets cost $270 to as much as $40K/each; Netflix hopes not leaving your
      couch is incentive to sign up.
