      ## IMPORTANT CONTEXT:


      In recent years, the % of eligible voters who turn out for midterms has
      declined.


      * 2014: **41.9%**

      * 2006: **47.8%**

      * 1998: **45.3%**

      * 1990: **49.3%**

      * 1982: **51.9%**

      ## Analysts expect a big jump in turnout for 3 reasons:


      * Turnout tends to jump during a President’s first midterm election.

      * Turnout during primary elections increased. Ex: 56% more eligible voters
      voted in this year’s House primary elections compared to 2014.

      * Voter registration skyrocketed (800,00+ new voters – a record vs.
      771,321 in 2016).

      With Election Day one week away, the number of voters participating in
      early voting has already broken records in Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
      Indiana, Minnesota, Nevada, Tennessee, and Texas.
