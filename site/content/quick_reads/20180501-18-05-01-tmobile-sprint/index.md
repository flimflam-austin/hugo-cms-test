      > **What’s different this time?**  

      Their sales pitch: merger makes the U.S. beat China on 5G wireless
      (ultra-fast internet).  
        
        
        
      **Why would that plan work?**  

      Trump Admin shown 5G is a priority.  
        
        
        
      **Not everybody is buying it…**  

      _“I’ll stipulate that John Legere (CEO of T-Mobile) is the world’s
      greatest salesman. But what he’s selling right now, it’s old stuff.”_

      ## How Will Deal Affect You?


      > 


      * **Less Competition:** U.S. wireless market dominated by 3 players.

      * **Closer in Size:**A Tie-up gives T-Mobile/Sprint 100M customers (AT&T
      93M, Verizon 116M).

      * **5G:** Faster rollout of a nationwide higher-speed internet network.

      * **Higher Bills?:** Unclear, but Economics 101: less competition = higher
      prices.

      > _‘Combination will not only result in less choice for consumers, it will
      provide greater incentive for the 3 remaining companies to act in
      concert.”_

      _‘I think this deal is good for consumers. …T-Mobile led this aggressive,
      consumer-focused charge… (rivals have) been forced to follow suit.’_

**_Will my bill go up?_**  
_Possibly, but not immediately. It”s difficult to promise that prices will remain at their current levels, even though the companies say consumers should expect the deal to lower prices.**But more competition is generally regarded as better for consumers. After all, look at what happened after regulators denied an attempted merger by T-Mobile and Sprint in 2014.**That year, after regulators signaled they would reject a deal, the two companies began a price war that rippled across the industry. Then in August 2016, T-Mobile was the first carrier in the United States to offer unlimited voice, text and data plans. The next day, Sprint began offering a $100 unlimited voice, text and data plan for two lines. Six months later, Verizon and then AT&T followed with similar offerings. Over all, wireless prices declined 13 percent from March 2016 to March 2017, according to the Labor Department._
