      ## Why Now?


      > ‘This is the reality setting in that you’ve got to plan this out.”  
        
        
        
      Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), responding to a question about whether the
      President's declaration that 2,000 U.S. troops will withdraw from Syria
      was a mistake. A day after Pres. Trump's announcement, fmr. Sec. of Def
      Mattis resigned & emphasized the importance of America's allies. NS
      Advisor John Bolton & Sec. Pompeo are now meeting with key regional
      Mideast allies.

      > ‘One day he (President Trump) is saying we are in Syria for the long
      term to fight Iran. The next day Trump says we’re leaving in 30 days and
      Iran can do whatever it wants in Syria. It’s impossible to be effective in
      this environment.”  
        
        
        
      Ilan Goldenberg, fmr. Obama official, now w/the bipartisan nonprofit

      ## YOUR SAFETY AT STAKE


      * **ISIS:** Last week, two Americans were reportedly captured fighting
      with ISIS in Syria – a reminder of the terrorist group’s powerful ideology
      despite loss of territory.

      * **Iran:** Funds terrorist organizations, wants to expand anti-American
      influence in region and is suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons.
