      ## Why al-Shabab Matters:


      * al-Shabab = “The Youth”

      * Terrorist Islamist group; wants to rule with Sharia law.

      * Attacks/murders innocent civilians in Kenya, Somalia & East Africa.

      * U.S. recently expanded operations againstA al-Shabab due to concerns the
      group will gain more territory & power in Africa and launch attacks on
      Americans, either overseas or in U.S.
