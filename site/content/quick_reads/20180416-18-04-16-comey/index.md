      # REVENGE or MORE?


      “**He is morally unfit to be president.**“


      Ahead of the release of his book, former FBI director James Comey sat down
      with ABC News to make HIS case against the President.

      ## Comey on Pres. Trump:


      **Likens him to a mob boss & offers few kind words:** “This president is
      unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values.”


      **Stops short of calling him a criminal:** ‘I have one perspective on the
      behavior I saw, which while disturbing and violating basic norms of
      ethical leadership, may fall short of being illegal.’

      ## Pres. Trump on Comey:


      “James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR.”


      “He is a weak and untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a
      terrible Director of the FBI.”


      “It was my great honor to fire James Comey!”

      ## Is Comey’s Book A Game Changer?


      Legal experts question whether Comey’s words could come back to hurt him
      or the FBI’s Russia’s probe.


      **What To Watch For:**  

      If what Comey says in an interview or book is inconsistent with his
      previous public statement, he may discredit himself and potentially impact
      current investigations.
