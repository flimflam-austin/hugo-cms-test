George Washington traveled from his home in VA to the nation’s then-capital: New York City.\n* He took the oath of office on an outdoor balcony in front of a large crowd, his hand on a Bible – thus beginning the current tradition.

      ## Why January 20?


      * Inauguration Day used to take place on March 4 due to how long it took
      to collect & count votes.

      * The **20th Amendment** in 1933 changed Inauguration Day to Jan. 20.

      * The Constitution states one presidential term is ended and the new one
      begins at noon on the 20th, and has only one other specific requirement
      for the day: **the new president must take an oath of office.**

      ## The Parade


      * Inaugural parades began as an informal event escorting the president
      **to the Capitol** to be sworn in.

      * **1809**: the inauguration of James Madison included the first
      formally-planned parade route, with participants from around the country.

      * Modern day: the parade and its thousands of attendees escort the
      President and VP **from the Capitol** to the White House.

      ## Unique Moments:


      1801: Pres. Thomas Jefferson remains the only president to walk to and
      from his inauguration ceremony.


      1925: Inaugural address first broadcast on the radio (Pres. Coolidge).
      1949: First televised inauguration (Pres. Truman’s second term).


      1961: Army flame throwers melted the snow off Pennsylvania Ave. so the
      parade could go on.

      The presidential oath is typically recited with one hand on a Bible,
      though it is not required. John Q. Adams took his oath in 1825 using a
      book of law. Pres. Theodore Roosevelt held up his hand. Pres. Obama used
      Pres. Lincoln's Bible for both inaugurations, and added Dr. MLK Jr's Bible
      for his second. Pres. Trump also used the Lincoln Bible in addition to his
      own.
