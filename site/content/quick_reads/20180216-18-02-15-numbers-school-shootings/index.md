      # Florida Shooting


      ## “It is a horrifying statistic. And it is wrong.”


      Washington Post calls out statistic generated by anti-gun group that
      states Wednesday’s shooting was the 18th school shooting in the USA this
      year.

      ## “This is the 18th school shooting in the U.S. in 2018.”


      * Nonprofit “Everytown for Gun Safety” tweeted out this statistic.

      * Everytown counts ANY gun discharge in school or on school property as a
      “school shooting” – even if school is closed, shots are fired
      accidentally, or no one is injured.

      ## Two Sides


      _Everytown_ says any gunfire in school/on school grounds “undermines the
      sense of security’ of students.


      _Washington Post_A says all gun discharges on school grounds are not equal
      and some should not count as a “school shooting” – numbers should not be
      inflated.

      ## Washington Post Argues:


      _“The figures matter because gun-control activists use them as evidence in
      their fight for bans on assault weapons, stricter background checks and
      other legislation. Gun rights groups seize on the faults in the data to
      undermine those arguments and, similarly, present skewed figures of their
      own.”_

      ## Others Agree


      “…this play on gun-control emotions is particularly troublesome because it
      takes the spotlight off of what is really worrisome. In this case, the
      shooter was well known to the school, known to the FBI, and known to many
      others as a deranged person with a serious violent streak.So why isn’t the
      focus of the public debate on what went wrong?” _Investors Business Daily_

* **No, There Haven’t Been 18 School Shootings This Year — Not Even Close:** _In fact, of the 18 “school shootings,”A only five occurred during school hours, and only four — including the latest — are what most people would consider a school shooting; in which someone brings a gun to school with the intent of shooting students.A_ _Of those three previous shootings, only one resulted in deaths, when a 15-year-old boy armed with a handgun opened fire inside a Kentucky high school and killed two fellow students while injuring 14 others. The two others resulted in two injuries.A This is by no means meant to downplay the seriousness of this issue. These are all terrible tragedies, and parents have the right to expect that their children are safe at school._A [https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/no-there-havent-been-18-school-shootings-this-year-not-even-close/](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/no-there-havent-been-18-school-shootings-this-year-not-even-close/)
