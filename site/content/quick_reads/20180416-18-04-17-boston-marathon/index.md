I couldn”t be happier for Desi, said Rainsberger, a longtime coach in Colorado Springs whose daughter, Katie, was a 10-time Colorado state champion for Air Academy and is now a sophomore at track powerhouse Oregon. It”s just going to be a great statement for the future of all our little girls who are growing up, “Hey, I”m going to be a runner.”A She is gutsy, she”s a bourbon drinker, she”s a beer drinker, she”s a blue-collar girl, she”s living in Michigan. It doesn”t get any better than that.
