      ## The Final Resolution:


      “… the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and
      white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field,
      representing a new constellation.”  
        
      **Red**: valor  

      **White**: purity  

      **Blue**: perseverance

      ## Who Made The First Flag?


      * It remains one of the great mysteries of American history.

      * Common lore suggests Betsy Ross, a seamstress in Philadelphia, the city
      where the Continental Congress met.

      * Surprisingly, no facts support or document this story.

      * Historians generally agree Ross likely knew Gen. Washington & sewed
      flags in her family’s shop.

      into law. Why does the flag get folded 13 times? Each fold has a meaning.
