      # GAME CHANGER


      ## What If There Were No More Mosquitoes?


      Experiment wipes out 80% of “one of the world’s most dangerous pests” in a
      bid to save millions of lives from disease-carrying mosquitoes.


      DEETS ON NO MORE DEET

      ## The Experiment


      * **Who:** Researchers infected “Aedes aegypti” male mosquitoes with
      bacteria making them sterile.

      * **Where:** Released 3M in Australia.

      * **What:** Sterile male mosquitoes didn’t bite or spread disease, and
      when they mated with wild females, eggs didn’t hatch – effectively wiping
      out population.

      * **Why:** The mosquitoes spread diseases like dengue fever & zika.

      ## Why it Matters


      * Majority of mosquitoes don’t spread diseases, BUT 3 most deadly (found
      globally) are responsible for **17% of infectious disease transmissions**.

      * Researchers say this experiment **offers a potential new solution**.

      * In May, the CDC warned the US is **“not fully prepared”** for these
      **widespread & difficult to control diseases.**

      Why do we need mosquitoes anyway? And what's the downside to wiping out a
      population? Read on here.

It”s not an important part of the environment and it”s a major spreader of diseases around the world, CSIRO”s Paul De Barro told AAP._

* **What if Every Mosquito on Earth Went Extinct Tomorrow?: (FROM 2014)**

_**Public health entomologist Grayson Brown of the University of Kentucky:** If mosquitoes went extinct: Mosquito larvae are very important in aquatic ecology. Many other insects and small fish feed on them and the loss of that food source would cause their numbers to decline as well. Anything that feeds on them, such as game fish, raptorial birds, etc. would in turn suffer too. Mosquitoes can be wiped out but the ecological damage that would be necessary (draining swamps/wetlands, applying pesticides over wide areas), along with strict regulatory enforcement, would make eradication not worth it unless there was a very serious public health emergency._
