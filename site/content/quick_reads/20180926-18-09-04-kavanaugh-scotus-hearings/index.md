      # High Court Hearings


      Judge Brett Kavanaugh


      **91% of U.S. likely voters agree Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions impact
      everyday life, yet 65% can’t name Pres. Trump’s 2nd SCOTUS nominee**,
      according to a recent C-SPAN survey.

      ## Why Have Hearings?


      * President has power to nominate, but Senate must confirm.

      * During the hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee will ask Kavanaugh
      about his judicial philosophy to get an idea of how he *might* rule in the
      future.

      * Expect to hear about big issues: abortion, presidential powers, etc.

      ## KAVANAUGH’S CHANCES?


      * In 2017, the Senate changed its rules to allow confirmation by a simple
      majority (51 of 100) instead of needing 60 votes.

      * GOP will have a 51-49 majority going into the confirmation vote;
      Kavanaugh may get “Yes” votes from Democrats as well.
