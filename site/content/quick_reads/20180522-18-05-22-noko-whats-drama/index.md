      ## “Denuclearization”


      The White House wants North Korea to agree to “denuclearization.”


      * Definition: “Total. Full. Complete” removal of all nuclear weapons in
      North Korea (Sec. of State Mike Pompeo).

      * National Security Advisor John Bolton mentioned a “Libya-model”
      denuclearization – this sparked trouble in NoKo.

      ## Quick Catch-Up: Libya


      * Libya negotiated “denuclearization” in 2003 in return for $anctions
      relief.

      * Libyan regime collapsed during Arab Spring (2011); unrelated to nuke
      deal but U.S. had an active role (w/NATO) forcing regime out.

      * NoKo: Libya’s fate show why NoKo NEEDS nukes – for security, leverage
      and to keep America from meddling in its affairs.

      ## Debate: Denuclearization


      * NoKo views Bolton’s comments as “an awfully sinister move to impose on
      our dignified state the destiny of Libya…”

      * Could “denuclearization” for North Korea mean no nukes on **ENTIRE
      KOREAN PENINSULA**? The U.S. doesn’t have nukes in South Korea but a key
      military base. Could that change?A **Is that a non-starter for the
      summit?**

      SmartHER Tip: Watch what's going on with China (NoKo trade partner). The
      U.S. said it's putting "the trade war on China (tariffs) on hold" after
      positive talks. We don't know all the details, but we're watching the
      timing...

> _Bolton said North Korea had used negotiations in the past to camouflage its weapons development and he was skeptical about its intentions. He said U.S. ally South Korea, which restarted talks with North Korea this year, should be cautious before agreeing to anything with Pyongyang._  
  
  
  
_We should insist that if this meeting is going to take place, it will be similar to discussions we had with Libya 13 or 14 years ago: how to pack up their nuclear weapons program and take it to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, he said._
