      U.S. economic growth has boosted demand for oil which means most consumers
      should be able to afford to pay more at the pump, BUT wildcards in
      oil-producing areas may mean higher prices ahead.

      get over it. But $4 is like the electric fence in Jurassic Park. There’s
      no getting over that."_**

      ## WHAT’S TO BLAME?


      * **Seasonality:** Federal & state laws **require cleaner, costlier gas.**

      * **Iran:** Reimposing **sanctions may constrict supply** & while we don’t
      get our oil from Iran, Econ 101 says less global supply = higher prices.

      * **Saudi Arabia:** World’s largest oil producer signaled it wants oil
      prices $80-$100/barrel. Oil just toppedA **$70/bbl, a level notA seen

      ## Feeling Tapped Out?


      Higher gas prices are on track to **cost Americans an extra $38B** this
      year, **erasing about one-third of the direct benefit from Pres. Trump’s
      tax cuts**, Morgan Stanley estimates.


      If gas stays at these levels for the year, it’ll **cost the average
      American household $450 extra**.

* **Best days of the week to buy gas via GasBuddy:**A [https://www.gasbuddy.com/NewsRoom/PressRelease/600](https://www.gasbuddy.com/NewsRoom/PressRelease/600)  
_GasBuddy analyzed gas price data from the period of January- March 2018 and found that the first day of the work week offers the lowest average gas price in 21 states, making it the best day to fill-up. Friday is the worst day to buy gas in 19 states, having the most expensive average._  
_Though there is variation in daily gas prices across different states, the consensus is that the earlier motorists fill-up during the week, the better, says Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. Following Monday, Sunday is the cheapest day to fill-up. A Conversely, Thursday follows Friday as the most expensive day to fill-up._  
_Consumers are missing a big opportunity at the pump when it comes to saving time and money, says DeHaan. Our data shows that most motorists are filling up on not only the most expensive day, but the busiest. Having a tank of gas last until Sunday or even Monday each week can collectively save drivers $2.6 billion, and spare the headache of not being able to find an available pump._
