      # Your Rideshare Rights


      * Most drivers are independent contractors and own their cars.

      * Laws have yet to catch up with technology and differ state to state (&
      sometimes by locality).

      * In most states, it’s legal to secretly record you b/c you don’t have a
      ‘**reasonable expectation of privacy**’ in someone else’s car AND consent
      is only required from one party (ie: the recorder).

      > ‘This is one of those things that’s certainly a breach of our norms, but
      the law might not be a great way to take care of that yet…. That could
      change if the law evolves, but it’s moving pretty slow when it comes to
      this technology.”  
        
        
        
      Chip Stewart, journalism professor at Texas Christian University, who
      studied the privacy implications of live streaming technology and the
      right to record.

      Most rideshare drivers employ dash cams for security purposes and to
      protect against false reviews, but others are ca$hing in by selling their
      data to real estate or self-driving car companies.
