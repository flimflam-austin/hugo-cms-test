      > “The giant drill is clearly meant as a show of strength by Vladimir
      Putin and his military, a demonstration that – despite Western sanctions,
      including against the defence sector – the country remains defiant.”  
        
        
        
      Sarah Rainsford, BBC journalist in Moscow, who adds Russia views NATO as a
      threat as well.

      ## What You Should Know:


      * Russia holds these military drills every year; last year’s was also
      historically large & in September (but not during 9/11).

      * This year: 300,000 Russians participating; 36,000 tanks.

      * Drills prepare for a massive conflict.

      * Some say Russia inflates the numbers, BUT military strength part of
      Pres. Putin’s agenda.

      ## “UNPRECEDENTED”


      * It’s not just the size of the military drill, but the fact **China added
      more than 3,000 troops to Russia’s annual exercise.**

      * Russian & Chinese leaders reportedly meeting during drills.

      * Takeaway: This is a significant show of cooperation vs. the United
      States as a global leader (what both sides refer to as a “unipolar
      world”).

      The U.S. participates in smaller "war games" with NATO & with South Korea.
      By preparing to work with allies, we rehearse what would happen in a
      crisis. Some note Russia/China together could challenge U.S. military
      dominance.

The Russian military has increased both the scope and frequency of its maneuvers amid tensions with the West. It also has expanded military ties with China.A Moscow and Beijing have conducted a series of joint military maneuvers, including exercises in the South China Sea and navy drills in the Baltics last summer.A The two countries have forged what they described as a strategic partnership, expressing their shared opposition to the unipolar world — the term they use to describe perceived U.S. global domination.
