      ## HOW IT CAME TO BE:


      * Many presidents and their families had Christmas trees INSIDE the White
      House.

      * On **Christmas Eve 1923,** Pres. Coolidge became the first to light a
      tree on the outside lawn, starting an **annual tradition**. Middlebury
      College in VT, his home state, donated a balsam fir.

      * 2,500 electric bulbs lit the 48-ft tree in front of a crowd of 3,000.

      * **Host**: National Park Service & its non-profit National Park
      Foundation

      * **Tree:A** From 1924 – 1953 live trees were used, then cut trees were
      used until 1973. Live trees have been used ever since.

      * **Decorations**: Family company, Hargrove Inc., has decorated the tree
      since 1954; Earl Hargrove would fix light bulbs, climbing the tree dressed
      as Santa.
