      The three hidden words on NASA's Perseverance rover's parachute reading
      "dare mighty things" are from an 1899 speech by Pres. T. Roosevelt (then
      NY governor) in which he emphasizes the need to embrace challenges,
      advising "not to shirk difficulties, but to overcome them; not to seek
      ease, but to know how to wrest triumph from toil and risk."

[‘Dare mighty things’: The man behind the secret message in the Mars rover’s parachute ~ “We’ve been wanting to do this kind of mission for nearly six decades now,” Clark said. “When we dare mighty things, we actually can accomplish phenomenal successes.”](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/27/world/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-parachute-scn/index.html)

[FULL SPEECH FROM PRES. THEODORE ROOSEVELT (THEN GOVERNOR OF NY):](https://history.msu.edu/hst203/files/2011/02/Roosevelt-The-Strenuous-LIfe.pdf)

EXCERPTS:

_“I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph._

_…a healthy state can exist only when the men and women who make it up lead clean, vigorous, healthy lives; when the children are so trained that they shall endeavor, not to shirk difficulties, but to overcome them; not to seek ease, but to know how to wrest triumph from toil and risk._

_Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat._

_If we are to be a really great people, we must strive in good faith to play a great part in the world. We cannot avoid meeting great issues. All that we can determine for ourselves is whether we shall meet them well or ill._

_We have a given problem to solve. If we undertake the solution, there is, of course, always danger that we may not solve it aright; but to refuse to undertake the solution simply renders it certain that we cannot possibly solve it aright._

_We cannot sit huddled within our own borders and avow ourselves merely an assemblage of well-to-do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond. Such a policy would defeat even its own end; for as the nations grow to have ever wider and wider interests, and are brought into closer and closer contact, if we are to hold our own in the struggle for naval and commercial supremacy, we must build up our power without our own borders._

_I preach to you, then, my countrymen, that our country calls not for the life of ease but for the life of strenuous endeavor. The twentieth century looms before us big with the fate of many nations. If we stand idly by, if we seek merely swollen, slothful ease and ignoble peace, if we shrink from the hard contests where men must win at hazard of their lives and at the risk of all they hold dear, then the bolder and stronger peoples will pass us by, and will win for themselves the domination of the world. Let us therefore boldly face the life of strife, resolute to do our duty well and manfully; resolute to uphold righteousness by deed and by word; resolute to be both honest and brave, to serve high ideals, yet to use practical methods. Above all, let us shrink from no strife, moral or physical, within or without the nation, provided we are certain that the strife is justified, for it is only through strife, through hard and dangerous endeavor, that we shall ultimately win the goal of true national greatness.”_
