      # So Now What?


      Republicans control the Senate by a 50-49 majority due to Sen. John
      McCain’s prolonged absence, limiting the impact of any efforts by the
      Democrats to thwart Trump’s nominee.

      Kavanaugh served as a law clerk for Justice Kennedy alongside Pres.
      Trump's 2017 Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Justice Kennedy was
      appointed by a republican president (Reagan) but was the court's "swing"
      vote not wedded to one ideology.
