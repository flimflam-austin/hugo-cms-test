      ===============

      deadly mix of 7,000 chemicals in smoke from regular cigarettes. However,
      **e-cigarette aerosol is not harmless**. It can contain harmful and
      potentially harmful substances, including nicotine, heavy metals like
      lead, volatile organic compounds, and cancer-causing agents.”
