      President Trump takes on Amazon.


      More than 6 out of 10 American households have an Amazon “Prime”
      Membership.


      But is this part of a bigger deal that no one is watching?

      makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.
      Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the
      country…not a level playing field!”

      ## Post Office Problem$


      * U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is bleeding money (lost $2.7B last yr, **$63B
      since 2007**), mostly due to pension & health care costs.

      * Pkg delivery a source of revenue, but not enough to cover losses.

      * USPS has “deal” with Amazon but we don’t know the specifics (USPS is
      independently operated and makes deals with retailers outside of gov’t
      oversight).

      > “I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike
      others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our
      Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.),
      and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!”

      Fact Check:  

      Is Amazon A Tax Cheat?


      * One of largest U.S. companies, but pays nearly $0 in fed’l taxes (by
      using tax breaks & credits)

      * Amazon paid $957M in income taxes in 2017.

      * Amazon *used* to not collect sales tax (arguably hurting state/local
      govt), but has since ’17.

      * Amazon uses USPS to deliver pkgs because it’s cheaper. Period.

      Fox Business Anchor & Harvard Business School Grad, Melissa Francis, says
      the tweets on Amazon are all part of the President's plan to negotiate
      Amazon DOWN on a completely separate government contract. She says this is
      a pattern...

* **SmartHer Take**: Amazon didn’t cause the U.S. postal service’s downfall, but it usually pays less using USPS than it would from other big corps (FedEx & UPS), and like other big corps, it pays taxes, but benefits from tax breaks / loopholes.
