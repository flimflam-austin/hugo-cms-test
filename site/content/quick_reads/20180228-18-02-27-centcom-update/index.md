      # Key Takeaways


      * **ISIS**: Losing “physical caliphate” but pressure needs to continue.

      * **Iran**: Moving dangerous missiles around the Middle East to places
      like **Yemen**.

      * **Russia**: Major mischief maker, undermining efforts inside **Syria**.

      * Something to watch: **China’s** growing presence in Middle East, such as
      a port in **Pakistan** and military base in **Djibouti** (Africa).

      ## Top Priority: Iran


      > “Make no mistake, while we continue to confront the scourge of
      terrorism, **Iran**’s malignedA actives across the region pose long term
      threat to stability in this part of the world.”

      ## Why It Matters:


      * CentCom’s focus on Iran, despite all the major players, serves as a
      reminder of Iran’s powerful role as an anti-American state sponsor of
      terror.

      * The Middle East impacts our national security, not only because of
      terrorism threat, but also economically (oil markets, shipping lanes,
      investment of military “men & materials”).

      SmartHER News quotes the "open" session available to the public; General
      Votel also testified in a classified setting not open to the press. This
      is normal practice, but important to mention.
