      In 2017, Carey spoke to Billboard about how her modern day Christmas
      anthem almost wasn't. With Christmas still weeks away, the 1994 hit has
      already made its way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Rolling
      Stone Top 100. In 2019, it was the most-streamed holiday song with 308.9M
      audio and video streams. Christmas is Mariah's holiday - she recently told
      WSJ “I really do live from Christmas to Christmas."
