      ## Study: Highlights


      **Women:** “on average happier and more optimistic’ (researchers looking
      at recent readings of “optimism” vs. what women felt in comparison data
      from 1968-75).


      Those with **less than a high school education** (especially white
      Americans) suffered from **greater declines in optimism** over the years
      (and higher mortality rates).

      Why?


      * Does optimism lead one to pursue better quality of life? i.e. pursuing
      better health, jobs, education = longer lives.

      * TBD. Researchers found optimism fluctuated and longevity seemed impacted
      as well by $$ or education.

      * Past Study: Some researchers believe our physiology is healthier when we
      are more hopeful.

      Education may not *just* impact optimism, but also employment. The U.S.
      unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma is nearly 6%.
      With a college degree? 1.9% (U.S. unemployment rate: 3.9%).
