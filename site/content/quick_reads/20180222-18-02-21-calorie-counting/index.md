      States. It’s time for U.S. and other national policies to stop focusing on
      calories and calorie counting.’

      ## Study by Journal of the American Medical Association


      * Goal: To test whether genetics determines what diets work for certain
      people and not others.

      * Findings: **Quality over quantity mattered.** Type of food, not
      calories, led to weight loss.

      * BTW: Genetics alone doesn’t determine ability to lose weight.

      calories they eat and then telling them to cut back on 500 calories, which
      makes them miserable.’ Find out what Dr. Chris Gardner says we should do
      instead:
