      Exact Origin?  

      No One Knows For Sure


      > “This custom started in medieval times…people often concealed weapons in
      their hands. The handshake was a way of affirming that neither you nor the
      person you were greeting was carrying anything intended to harm.”

      Do We Shake Hands…  

      To Smell Each Other?


      Say…A **_What?_**


      One study suggests we touch our face more often after shaking hands,
      without even realizing it – an instinctual way to “sniff out” the other
      person.

      ## What makes a good handshake?


      > “In North America and Europe, a firm handshake is an appropriate form of
      greeting. In Asia and the Middle East the customary grip is gentler; a
      too-hearty grip could be interpreted as aggressive.”
