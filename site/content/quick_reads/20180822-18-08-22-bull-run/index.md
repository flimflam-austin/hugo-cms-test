      ## Why It Matters


      * **Stocks’ “bull market”** (sustained period when stocks are rising &
      expected to continue to rise) on track to be **longest in history**.

      * Surprising after **stocks plunged 50% during the financial crisis**
      ending March 9, 2009.

      * Gains have **added trillions of dollars** to household wealth, boosting
      the economy and retirement savings.

      ## Important Context


      * Last time stocks rose for this long was theA **dot-com boom** (October
      1990 – March 2000).

      * However, during the 1990s run, stocks rose 417%. That’sA **nearly 25%
      *MORE* than this current bull market** **run,**A according to LPL
      Financial.

      * Bottom line: **it’s the longest bull market, but not necessarily the
      greatest.**

      > “ThisA bullA marketA has been breathtaking…valuations in general have
      become stretched; however, corporate earnings have been strong, and I
      believe US stocks are likely to continue to outperform in the shorter term
      given the strength of the US economy and the perceived safety of US stocks
      in the midst of trade wars.”

      Strong earnings growth continues to power the stock market, but experts
      warn investors to continue to watch trade disputes and possible higher
      interest rates. Timing matters: the Federal Reserve, which sets interest
      rates, meets on Friday to discuss the economy & policy.
