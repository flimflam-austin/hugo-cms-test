      ## Death Knell For Cursive?


      > Nearly a century after the credit card was first introduced, the way you
      pay with it is about to change A **starting this weekend.**

      people do smiley faces.’_

      Change At The Checkout


      Starting Saturday, American Express, Discover, MastercardA & Visa will
      **stop requiring signatures**.


      * Signatures used to help verify your identity. NowA “no longer reliable.”

      * Most people just scribble an illegible signature.

      * Most businesses don’t even bother to check.

      ## So I’ll Never Sign Again?


      Not collecting signatures is optional, leaving retailers to decide.


      But speeding up checkout lines is a powerful incentive. (Walmart calls
      signatures “worthless.”)


      Restaurants may still ask so the customer has the opportunity to tip.


      no auTOGRAPHS, PLEASE.

      ## Is Your Safety in Jeopardy?


      _‘Our fraud capabilities have advanced so that **signatures are no longer
      necessary to fight fraud**.’_  

      Jaromir Divilek, American Express


      * Microchips in credit cards create unique codes for each purchase, making
      cards harder to copy.

      * Once merchants upgraded swipe technology, signatures became “largely
      irrelevant.”
