      # Border Emergency?


      **“_I can do it if I want… We can call a national emergency and build it
      very quickly_.”**


      A president can declare a national emergency – **EVERY president since
      1976 has done so –**A *BUT* may President Trump do so in order to fund a
      border wall?

      The **1976 National Emergencies Act** allows a president to declare an
      emergency in order to, among other things:


      * take property & commodities

      * limit travel & prohibit trade

      * invoke martial law & send troops


      The Act does NOT define “national emergency.”A The president must use
      existing laws to do so.

      ## Presidential Power Limits


      * The president must identify an **existing law** to invoke the emergency
      power (example: use the legal definition of an “immigration emergency” to
      make his case).

      * Emergencies **expire** after one year UNLESS renewed.

      * Emergency can be rescinded any time via a **joint resolution** passed by
      both houses of Congress.

      BOTTOM LINE: Yes, it is within President Trump's legal authority to
      declare a national emergency without Congressional approval, *HOWEVER* if
      he does so in order to build a border wall, he is all but guaranteed to
      face a legal challenge.
