      > “It’s wonderful to be the first to do something, but I didn’t want to be
      the last, and if I did not do the job well enough there might be no second
      woman on the court.”

      # About the Woman:


      * Despite her exceptional academic credentials (#2 in her class at
      Stanford Law), she couldn’t find a law firm that would hire a woman. **Her
      first law job was unpaid.**

      * From 1960-65, she was a **stay-at-home mom** to her three sons.

      * In 1965, she became the Arizona Assistant Attorney General, and later
      she became the **first female Senate Majority Leader** (R) in AZ.

      PA law requiring women to obtain **spousal consent for abortion**.


      In 2000, she cast the deciding vote inA _Bush v. Gore,_ settling the
      dispute in the **2000 election** and awarding the presidency to George W.

      > “Treat people well. Don’t mislead them. Don’t be prickly. Don’t say
      things that are aggravating. Try to be as agreeable as you can be. Try to
      be helpful rather than harmful. Try to cooperate.  
        
        
        
      O'Connor in 2013 to the Harvard Business Review on what it's like working
      with colleagues with whom you disagree (potentially) for life. Supreme
      Court justices have lifetime tenure.
