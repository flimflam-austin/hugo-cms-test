      # COPY THAT.


      ## Identity Theft Costs Us $17B Every Year.


      But while we’re all focused on cybercriminals… maybe we should remember
      that  

      relic in the office – the copy machine.

      ## Copy Machines Have Hard Drives, Too.


      Since 2002, every copier contains a hard drive – like your computer’s –
      storing an image of every document copied, scanned, or emailed.


      In 2010, CBS investigation found copiers for sale for $300, which it
      called a **“pot of gold” for identity thieves.**

      * Since CBS’s report in 2010, the industry stepped up security with hard
      drive encryption & automatic file scrubbing.

      * However, aA 2015 Ponemon survey showed **only** **38% of respondents
      were confident printer data was wiped before disposal or
      refurbishment.**  


      * This *despite* federal & some state laws requiring it.
