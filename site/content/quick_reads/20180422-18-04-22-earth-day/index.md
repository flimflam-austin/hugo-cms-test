SCOTT PRUITT

By Christine Todd Whitman

“Until recently, decades of scientific research on climate change formed the springboard for the EPA”s protective and effective measures. However, under the administration of Scott Pruitt, the agency is experiencing a new wave of policymaking—or rather, policy dismantling. (He has already dismantled the Clean Power Plan, which would have regulated carbon dioxide emissions in the power sector, and is now targeting vehicle-emissions standards.) If his actions continue in the same direction, during Pruitt”s term at the EPA the environment will be threatened instead of protected, and human health endangered instead of preserved, all with no long-term benefit to the economy.”

_Whitman, who served as EPA administrator under President George W. Bush, is a former governor of New Jersey_

* **Pruitt Leads the Way on Regulatory RollbackA**  
[https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/03/26/pruitt_leads_the_way_on_regulatory_rollback_110563.html](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/03/26/pruitt_leads_the_way_on_regulatory_rollback_110563.html)

Before taking over at the EPA, Pruitt was as a leading opponent of regulatory overreach by the agency. As general of Oklahoma, for instance, he dissolved the Environmental Protection Unit and instead created a Federalism Unit to fight President Obama”s aggressive regulatory agenda. He broughtA more than a dozen lawsuitsA against the EPA, fighting such rules as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule and the Clean Water Rule, and successfully challenging the Clean Power Plan.A Now, as EPA administrator, Pruitt is taking even more direct action and doing so in a cooperative and transparent manner. When Office of Management and Budget Director Mick MulvaneyA discussed the deregulation effortA at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, he highlighted the rules that were top priority for the administration”s regulatory roll back: the Waters of the United States rule and the Clean Power Plan. Both fall within Pruitt”s jurisdiction at the EPA. No surprise that action on EPA regulations has moved to the forefront of the administration”s agenda.
