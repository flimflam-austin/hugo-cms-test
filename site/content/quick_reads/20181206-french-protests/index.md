      ## Fuel Tax Sparked Protests


      * France recently announced the next **fuel tax** increase on Jan. 1,
      2019; the “green tax” seeks to discourage use of fossil fuels.

      * Fuel prices in France cost approx. **$6-8/gal**. Taxes **would have
      added an extra 28Ac/gal to diesel** (the most popular fuel).

      * **Huge anti-government protests**A & riots followed over the last 3
      weeks;A 4 people died.

      ## FUEL TAX CANCELLED


      > ‘…if there is such a level of anger … it’s because we still have a lot
      of things to improve.’  
        
        
        
      Pres. Macron speaking to French lawmakers Wednes. As the threat of more
      protests loom, lawmakers canceled the fuel tax from the 2019 budget.
      Macron didn't start the fuel tax - it dates back to 2014 and has gradually
      risen over the last few years. Regardless, Macron's critics say his
      policies favor the wealthy.

      ## PROTESTS MAY NOT END


      > “There will be more demonstrations. We remain mobilized.’  
        
        
        
      Lionel Cucchi, protestor/spokesman. While the protests started because of
      the fuel tax, the anger ignited *other* protests varying from farmers
      wanting higher wages, to students, to truckers threatening to strike. One
      analyst described protestors as middle class & squeezed by the welfare
      state - paying high taxes but feeling few benefits.

      ## Why It Matters


      * Protests in France have inspired other violent protests in Europe.

      * In Brussels, protestors took to the streets over higher taxes and food
      prices.

      * **Big Picture**: The European Union is under pressure as the U.K’s exit
      looms & Russia rattles Ukraine. How long will this political crisis in
      France last? What’s the impact?

      America has a fuel tax too. Federal & state fees typically add
      approximately 52Ac/gallon. These taxes have helped to pay for roads &
      bridges, though debate rages about their efficacy. The nat'l avg. for a
      gallon of unleaded in America is $2.44/gal.
