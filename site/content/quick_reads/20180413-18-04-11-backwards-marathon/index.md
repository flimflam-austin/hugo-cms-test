      what’s ahead of you, seizures can come out of nowhere at anytime… Though
      for me it’s only temporary.”

      ## Backwards Training 101


      * Started running 0.5 mile backwards last summer, slowly increasing run
      lengths.

      * Ran 7 marathons _forwards_, qualifying him for Boston.

      * Trains on treadmills (which he says can be pretty boring) & in parks
      (looking out for obstacles).

      * During Boston Marathon, he’ll have a spotter to help him avoid spills or
      running into other people.

      ## How Hard Is Running Backwards Anyway?


      > _“SOOOO much harder!A It’s definitely not an efficient way of human
      movement.A You use your calves, quads and glutes so much more than
      forwards running.A You also use up a ton more energy.A I can’t stop
      eating!”_

      ## Charity Close to His Heart


      * Loren is running in memory of a brother he never met. Brian, his
      father’s son from a previous marriage, died in his sleep after suffering
      non-stop seizures.

      * 1 in 26 Americans will be diagnosed with epilepsy.

      * He’s more than halfway to his goal of raising $100K for the Epilepsy
      Foundation for research & local programs.
