      ## Why This Matters


      * Walmart’s stock can have broad impact – it accounted for a third of the
      Dow’s overall decline Tuesday.

      * 1 of 30 stocks traded on the Dow but its higher stock price means it
      weighs heavier on market overall.

      * Plus, investors see it as a symbol of America’s economy.

      ## Why Did This Happen?


      * eCommerce business increased overall, but not in final months of 2017.

      * Inventory issues for online sales surfaced during holiday season, i.e.
      gift items squeezed space for basic goods & created problems.

      * **Bottom Line:** Walmart (world’s largest retailer & America’s largest
      private employer) didn’t meet expectations.
