      # FIGHTING WORDS

      Hot rhetoric has reached the boiling point between Iran & the U.S.

      Here’s the CliffsNotes on the last week of this complex relationship.

      ## Important Context:


      * U.S. designated Iran a state sponsor of terror since 1984; only 3 other
      countries (Syria, North Korea & Sudan) share this label.

      * Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons (which they deny) has worried several
      U.S. presidents because of Iran’s connection with terror groups & their
      desire to assert themselves as a superpower.

      ## Why \*Extra Tense\* Now?


      * **Saturday:** Attack on Iranian military parade killed at least 25,
      injured dozens. Iran gov’t blames U.S. and threatens retaliation.

      * **UN General Assembly:** Iran & U.S. Presidents trade jabs.

      * **Sanctions:**A America will implement sanctions on Iran’s oil market in
      approx. 45 days; both Iran & U.S. under pressure economically &
      diplomatically.

      > “As victims of terrorism in the past and today, we have always been and
      will always remain in the forefront of genuine confrontation with
      terrorism.”  
        
        
        
      Iranian Pres. Rouhani during UN address. The U.S. State Dep't just issued
      an annual report underscoring Iran's status as a state sponsor of terror
      and highlighted Iran's relationship with groups like al Qaeda.

      > “We are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut
      their purchases substantially. We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor
      of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons.”  
        
        
        
      Pres. Trump during UN address. America received pushback from China,
      France, U.K and Russia (the other signatories of the original nuclear
      deal) about joining in sanctions on Iran's oil exports; they want to stay
      in the nuclear deal, for now.

      U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Matt responded to Iranian threats: "We've been
      clear; they shouldn't take us on like that". FYI: Iran fired rockets at
      U.S. embassy in Baghdad & consulate in Basra in early Sept after blaming
      America for igniting anti-Iran dissent.
