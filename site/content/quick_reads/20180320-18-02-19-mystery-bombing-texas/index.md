      ## What You Should Know:


      * **FBI & ATF devoting resources** to investigation. (Important: No matter
      where you live, federal tax dollars flowing to solve this crime).

      * Cops consider the tripwire bomb a ‘**significant change**’ – because of
      technology & target (seemingly random people).

      * Tripwire use also indicates a **level of sophistication**, according to
      law enforcement.
