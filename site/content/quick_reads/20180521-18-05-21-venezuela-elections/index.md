      ## More Oil Than Saudis, Why Are People Starving?


      * Venezuela’s oil is offshore or far underground, making it expensive to
      extract. It’s also less-desirable, harder-to-refine heavy crude.

      * **Gov’t drove out foreign oil cos**. for control, oil output at a
      30-year low.

      * In turn, gov’t printed more money, led to hyperinflation. Everything =
      expensive.

      tighter financial sanctions, including measures making it harder to export
      oil. That, coupled with new Iran sanctions, may spell higher oil prices
      for the world. Read more here.
