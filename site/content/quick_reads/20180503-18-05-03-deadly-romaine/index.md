      But I Still See It In Stores  

      & Restaurants… Is It Safe?


      Some grocery chains (Kroger, Meijer) & restaurants (Panera) have announced
      they are no longer sellingA or serving romaine from the Yuma area. But
      without that explicit assurance, Consumer Reports says it’s best to stay
      clear.
