      ## Why Some Don’t Like It:


      > “2,232 pages. $1.3 trillion. 48 hours.”  
        
        
        
      Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), Twitter, March 21, 2018 ~ Some feel there's TOO
      much spending and not enough public debate.

      > “Victory for conservatives today is that all of America now knows what a
      budget busting bomb this bill is. Hopefully, today’s battle will embolden
      conservatives to descend on Congress and demand Constitutional
      government.”  
        
        
        
      Sen Rand Paul (R, KY) Twitter, March 22, 2018 (He doesn't like the bill
      either)

      ## Bipartisan Support


      While some of the loudest critics came from conservative corners, the bill
      did receive some bipartisan support and that’s how it passed.


      _‘This is a bill that puts the middle class and those struggling to get
      there first.”_  

      Senator Chuck Schumer (D, NY) WSJ

      ## Why Pres Was Angry:


      _“I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact
      that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the
      Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is
      desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.”_  

      Pres. Trump, @Twitter, Friday March 24, 2018 8:55 a.m.

      ## For Your Consideration:


      * If Pres. did not sign spending bill by Saturday, gov’t would’ve shut
      down for the 3rd time this year, but ultimately he signed it.

      * The issue of immigration reform and $$ for a border wall (not a fence)
      continue to linger.

      ## Interesting Side-Story:


      * Despite the spending bill passing with majority support, one senator
      tried to derail it.

      * Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch didn’t like that his late “nemesis” was
      getting a forest renamed after him & tried to stop the bill passing
      because of it.

      * Proving the 2200+ page bill may have a lot of overlooked line items.

* NEW YORK TIMES:  
_There”s money for fencing, but no wall._  
_Nowhere was the dynamic on more vivid display than on Mr. Trump”s cherished proposal to spend tens of billions of dollars on a wall on the nation”s border with Mexico.The bill includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security — including new technology and repairs to existing barriers — but not Mr. Trump”s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. That includes $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing that was previously authorized under the 2006 Secure Fence Act, passed during the George W. Bush administration. But the measure prohibits building a concrete wall or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.The measure also explicitly rejects Mr. Trump”s plan for a hiring spree of border officers, an idea critics have condemned as an attempt to unleash a deportation force. The president signed an executive order during his first week in office last year calling for 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and he sought 2,000 in his budget request. The bill caps the number at 65_.A [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/trump-government-spending-bill.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/trump-government-spending-bill.html)
