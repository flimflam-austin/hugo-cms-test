      ## GROWING PAINS


      > **_‘I think it’s pretty much impossible to start a company in your dorm

      some mistakes.”_**  
        
        
        
      **Why it matters:**  

      The 33-year-old**A** ditched his trademark t-shirt & jeans for a navy

      FAKE NEWS &  

      HATE SPEECH


      > **_‘I agree that we’re responsible for the content.’_**  
        
        
        
      **Why it matters:**  

      This one is a biggie. Zuckerberg previously claimed that Facebook is not a
      media company, and takes no responsibility for what gets posted on the
      platform. This new admission could spell major changes for tech.

      ## RUSSIA INVESTIGATION


      > **_‘I know we’re working with them.’_**  
        
        
        
      **Why it matters:**  

      He said he hadn’t been interviewed by special counsel Mueller’s team, but
      offered few detailsA citing confidentiality. Mueller has charged 13
      Russians in a plot to interfere in the 2016 presidential election through
      social media propaganda – some of which was on Facebook.

      ## NEW LAWS COMING?


      > **_‘I’m not the type of person who thinks that all regulation is
      bad.’_**  
        
        
        
      **Why it matters:**  

      Republicans have yet to back it, but the Senate’s #2 Republican John
      Cornyn says people expect action. That said, in testimony Zuckerberg had
      to explain Facebook’s basic workings, highlighting how unprepared Congress
      is to impose game-changing rules.

      Overall, Zuckerberg came out largely unscathed in the nearly 5 hours of
      testimony. Facebook stock rose 4.5% on what investors deemed a positive
      performance. Zuckerberg will appear before the House Energy and Commerce
      Committee at 10AM ET today.
