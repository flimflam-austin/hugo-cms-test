      “At first it was a struggle and we didn’t know where our next cent was
      coming from. But we believed in our enterprise.”  
        
      Maurice McDonald, who with his brother Richard opened the first
      McDonald's. The two brothers left their home state of New Hampshire after
      the Great Depression, and headed to California to make it in the movie
      business. When their Hollywood adventure failed, they started with a hot
      dog stand, & later opened a restaurant in San Bernadino.

      > “I was an overnight success alright, but 30 years is a long, long
      night.”


      Ray Kroc developed the "McDonald's System" which later became the
      McDonald's Corporation. He focused on consistent, fast service across
      franchises, which also led to the development of Hamburger University
      where attendees received their degree in Bachelor of Hamburgerology. The
      program continues today.

      The world's largest fast food restaurant (by sales) just released guidance
      to its franchise owners in light of COVID-19. Some suggestions? Touchless
      sinks, automatic towel dispensers, and potentially face shields, a long
      with lingering questions about the expense for owners & the experience for
      customers.
