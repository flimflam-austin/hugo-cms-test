      # BAD RAP?


      We’re eating more tree nuts than ever…and they may have **FEWER** calories
      than we thought.

      ## BACKSTORY


      * **BACKGROUND:** The USDA and most food manufacturers rely on a
      century-old formula (1 gram of protein = 4 calories; 1 gram of fat = 9
      calories) to calculate a given food’s calorie content.

      * **RECENT:** That formula might not apply when it comes to certain tree
      nuts because they aren’t broken down (digested) like other foods, and
      therefore our bodies don’t absorb as much energy (calories).

      ## About The Studies


      * 2011: USDA researchers began studying how almonds, walnuts, & pistachios
      are digested in human “waste.”

      * Using those samples, researchers calculated how much fat, protein,
      carbohydrates, & calories were absorbed by the participant.

      * **Results:** Nuts had fewer *digestible* calories vs. calorie counts on
      labels: almonds (-32%), walnuts (-21%) & pistachios (-5%).

      ## WHY?


      > “If they’re not digested, then maybe the calorie content is not
      correct.”  
        
      Dr. David Baer, one of the USDA researchers involved in the studies.

      ## Also Worth Noting


      * Researchers found the more the nut is cooked (or processed), the more
      calories digested. Example: Almond butter has more calories than roasted
      almonds, but roasted almonds have more calories than raw almonds.

      * U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service unit
      conducted the studies. Nut producers and organizations contributed
      funding.

      ## BIG PICTURE


      > “We can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know
      incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.”  
        
      Prof. Tim Spector, Kings College in London, on nutrition science: "No
      other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies."
      Food manufacturers create their own nutrition labels. Research has raised
      questions about accuracy of labels & whether counts can be
      "one-size-fits-all."

      Kind Bars recently announced it's cutting the calorie counts of its nut
      bars by 10-30 calories per bar because of the new research. Are
      chocolate-covered nuts next? DON'T COUNT ON IT! Mars, which owns a share
      of Kind, isn't planning on lowering its calorie counts for M&M’s with
      almonds.
