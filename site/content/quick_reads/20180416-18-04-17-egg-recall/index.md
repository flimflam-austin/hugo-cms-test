_“AA red flag is there only for peopleA withA heart disease risk factors, says Julia Zumpano, RD, LD, of Cleveland Clinic”sA Preventive Cardiology Nutrition Program._

_‘There is no current recommendation on how many eggs you should consume each week,’ says Zumpano. ‘Research indicates that total saturated fat contributes more to LDL (bad) cholesterol than dietary cholesterol.’A She points out that egg whites are safe and a good source of protein. It is egg yolks that have the cholesterol and saturated fat you”re trying to avoid._

_‘If you have heart disease or high cholesterol, be cautious about the number of egg yolks you consume, and take into account all the other forms of saturated fat (red meat,A beef, pork, veal and lamb, poultry skin, whole-milk dairy or full-fat cheese) in your diet,’ says Zumpano.”_
