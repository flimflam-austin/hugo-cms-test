      in Basra, Iraq - the same building targeted by Iran rockets earlier this

      typical decline we had been expecting. That’s not going to be good news
      for motorists.”

      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reacting to the company's latest security
      breach. On Tuesday, hackers gained access to some 50 million accounts by

      > ‘They are part of our family, and their care needs to be a consideration
      during divorce proceedings.’  
        
        
        
      Assemblymember Bill Quirk (D-Hayward) who was behind new legislation just
      signed into law in Calfiornia that puts pets more in the category of
      children, rather than property (like a television or car), in divorce
      proceedings. Quirk argues the law will allow for better attention to who
      gets sole or shared custody.
