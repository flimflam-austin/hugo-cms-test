      “Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a
      degree from Trump University. He’s playing the American public for
      suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy
      hat.”

      # Why It Matters


      * President Trump has repeatedly commented on wanting more Republicans in
      Congress, in part to help the White House agenda.

      * Romney has a strong chance of keeping a Senate seat held by Republican
      Orin Hatch for 40 years (!) – “Red”.

      * However, it remains a question if Romney would support President Trump’s
      priorities.
