      > "My understanding is that they did it low-key and weren’t looking for
      publicity. There were enough to send every police officer, firefighter and
      extended family to the concert, and then some. The gesture was absolutely
      generous, significant and appreciated.”

      “I’ll always leave room for negotiation.”  
        
      President Trump responding to a question about funding a border wall
      during a press conference. Pres. Trump has requested $25B for border
      security (specifically a border wall), an allotment Congress has not met.
      While the President said he could shut down the government in the future
      by not approving a spending bill without that $$, he also said that when
      it comes to funding he has no red line and just wants great border
      security.

      Rallying cry at a Sunday protest in Russia against proposed hikes to the
      retirement age. The new legislation would move the retirement age for men
      to 65 from 60, and 63 from 55. The new bill has impacted Pres. Putin's
      popularity, though he says it's needed. We have to proceed not from
      emotions, but from the real assessment of economic conditions..., Putin
      said.

QA A A Thank you, Mr. President.A To follow up on what you were saying about the shutdown, sir, are you saying that you would be willing to shut the government down in September if it does not fully fund $25 billion worth of your border wall and also deliver all of the immigration priorities that you listed in your tweet?A Or are you leaving some room for negotiation there?_PRESIDENT TRUMP:A I”ll always leave room for negotiation.A But this has been many years; this isn”t just Trump administration.A We”re new.A This has been many years, even decades.A We have immigration laws.A We have border security.A We have all sorts of things going on that are — it”s disgraceful.A We are doing a phenomenal job.A We”re setting records.A But we have laws that don”t work.A So we”re working around those laws, and it”s unfortunate.**I have to take my hat off to the Border Patrols, for the law enforcement, to ICE, which really has been maligned by the Democrats.A The job they do — they go into these MS-13 nests — nests of bad, bad people — killers, in many cases.A And they go in there fearless, and they do an incredible job.A And they get them out.A They either go to jail or they get out of the country.A So I want to just take my hat off to ICE and the brave people that have really been maligned by the Democrats.**We need border security.A Without a border, as this gentleman can tell you also — because the Prime Minister really was — it was a very big factor in his win, and other people”s win in Italy — but it was a big factor in my win.A We need border security.A Border security includes the wall, but it includes many other things.A We have to end the lottery.A We have to end the chain.A The chain is like a disaster.A You bring one person in, and you end up with 32 people.A We have to end these horrible catch-and-release principles, where you catch somebody, you take their name, and you release them.A You don”t even know who they are.A And then they”re supposed to come back to a court case, where they want us to hire thousands of judges.A The whole thing is ridiculous.A And we have to change our laws, and we do that through Congress.**So I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.A As you know, we are already approving things in various bills, including we”re going to be taking care of the military.A We always put the military and law enforcement very high.A But I would be certainly willing to consider a shutdown if we don”t get proper border security.A Thank you.**Please.**QA A A Sir, just to follow up on that quickly: Is the $25 billion a red line for you?**PRESIDENT TRUMP:A I have no red line, unlike President Obama.A I just want great border security.A Okay?_
