      ## How Much Will The Summit Cost?


      **Short Answer: No one knows.**


      We don’t even know the precise location of the summit (a resort island
      called “Sentosa” rumored as meeiting ground).


      Singapore says: “…we’re willing to bear (some of the costs) to play a
      small part in this historic meeting.”

      U.S. can't pay for NoKo's bills (without waivers from the Treasury)
      because of sanctions. North Korea isn't used to paying its own bills - In
      fact, it didn't even pay for its own athletes to attend the Olympics.
