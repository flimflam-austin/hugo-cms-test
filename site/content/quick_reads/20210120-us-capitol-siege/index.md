      > “This is an unprecedented incident. If this investigation was a football
      game, we’d still be in the first quarter.”


      FBI Assistant Director in Charge Steven M. D’Antuono speaking last week.
      As the many investigations continue, law enforcement has requested the
      public's assistance. To date, the FBI alone has received countless tips
      and over 140,000 photos and videos.

      ## Unanswered Questions


      **The many lingering unknowns include:**


      * Why were law enforcement seemingly unprepared, understaffed & slow to
      respond?

      * Was there a coordinated attack plan? If so, who organized it, how many
      were a part of it (vs. rally attendees), and was there a specific goal or
      target(s)?

      * What, if any, assistance or guidance did the perpetrators get, and from
      whom?

      BIG PICTURE: Although the number of criminal cases are increasing daily,
      the legal proceedings are still in very early stages. As the numerous
      investigations continue and new information develops, we expect to learn a
      lot more in the days and weeks to come.
