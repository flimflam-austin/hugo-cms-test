      First State Enacts  

      “Free-Range Parenting” Law


      **UT leads** — TX & NY may be next.


      Here’s what **“free-range parenting”** means and why some say it fosters
      self-reliance & independence, while others say it is dangerous, and
      possibly illegal.

      Those who practice “**free-range parenting**” allow their kids to do
      things like, go to the park, walk to school, or take public
      transportation, **alone or with other children, but without any adult
      supervision.**


      Legal issues arise when child protective authorities view those
      “**freedoms**” as parental neglect & initiate legal proceedings against
      the parents to “**protect**” the kids.

      Although child abuse & neglect laws vary by state, the U.S Constitution
      protects theA “**_fundamental right ofA parentsA to makeA decisions
      concerning the care, custody, and control of their children_**.”


      Parents may parent as they see fit UNLESS they do something, or fail to do
      something, that places a child in **imminent risk of danger of physical or
      emotional harm.**

      **The Utah Law carves out exceptions to the state’s child neglect laws**
      by providing parents may permit their kids to engage in activities w/o
      adult supervision, like


      * “traveling to and from school”

      * “engaging in outdoor play”

      * “remaining at home unattended”  

      (so long as they are ofA “**sufficient age and maturity**” & theirA
      “**basic needs are met**.”)

      Did a particular event start this "free-range parenting" law in Utah? Not
      really...It's part of a lobbying effort that began several years ago.
      Here's the background:

(FROM CBS) What is free-range parenting?The idea can be traced back to something former New York Daily News columnistA Lenore Skenazy wrote a decade ago. She let her then 9-year-old son ride the New York City subway, and got labeled as “America’s worst mom.” “If you’re neglecting a child, that’s awful. You will be prosecuted. If you’re trusting your child and you taught them to cross the street and look both ways and not go off with strangers, you’re an old-fashioned parent, and that’s not against the law,” Skenazy says now.In 2015, a Maryland couple was investigated by child welfare authorities when they allowed their then 10- and 6-year-old kids to walk home alone from a park. Cases like that prompted the Utah law. “I don’t think that it’s healthy for them to always have mom, you know, right there watching them, making sure that they’re doing everything the way I want them to,” Butler said. “It’s healthy for them to explore play on their own.”Arkansas tried to pass a similar law but failed, and New Jersey is now considering one too. Parents who support letting their children roam point to crime statistics that show violent crime has actually gone down by half since 1991.
