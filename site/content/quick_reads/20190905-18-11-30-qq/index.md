His family's annual Christmas light display has taken place for at least 15 years & attracts throngs of onlookers. The town says the holiday display costs taxpayers at least $45K for resources to ensure traffic and pedestrian safety. Town officials want Apruzzi to foot the cost; Apruzzi believe his lights reflect his freedom of expression and he won’t pay."
