      ## How Much Should It Cost?


      * About **one-third** of America’s **35,000+ museums** are free.

      * But with funding under pressure, museums struggle with how much to
      charge.

      * **Ticket prices are crucial: Admissions represent 7%** of museum’s
      financial support, behind **endowments (22%) & museum store purchases
      (8%).**
