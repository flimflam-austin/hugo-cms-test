      > “An almond doesn’t lactate.”  
        
        
        
      Commissioner Scott Gottleib addressing food labels and the term "milk" -
      which he says refers to a product from a lactating animal. The FDA is
      reviewing the "public health consequences" of labeling different products
      "milk" when originally the term referred to only cow's milk.

      ## Why This Matters


      * Big Picture: Americans drinking less dairy milk, while consumption of
      “alternative” milks (almond, coconut, oat, etc.) on the rise.

      * The dairy industry says use of the term “milk” for other products
      misleads the public into believing alternatives provide the same
      nutritional value as cow milk, when they don’t; they want a new law
      “protecting” the milk label.

      > “No one owns the English language, and we’re not backing down.”  
        
        
        
      Michele Simon, Exec. Dir, Plant Based Foods Association, who wants to
      resolve this conflict in a "peaceful manner." The FDA has shown signs of
      empathy for the dairy industry, but enforcing any change to the language
      remains questionable.

      Laws DO exist to protect certain products, such as "bourbon" (whiskey
      produced in the United States in a particular way). Will that extend to
      cow's milk? Should it?
