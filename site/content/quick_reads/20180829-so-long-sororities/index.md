      WHY?  

      Administrative Pressure


      In 2016, Harvard said it would prevent Class of 2021 members of
      single-gender groups from holding student leadership roles, receiving
      endorsements for fellowships, & becoming varsity captains.


      Accordingly, Alpha Phi, Harvard’s last remaining Greek sorority, has
      become the co-ed group, ‘**The Ivy**.”

    body: "> “It is with deep sadness that we accept Iota Tau’s decision to cease activities. New sanctions put in place by Harvard University placed our members in an untenable conflict a\x13 to choose between their supportive, empowering women-only space and external scholastic and leadership opportunities.”  \n  \n  \n  \nRenee Zainer, Alpha Phi International President and Chairman of the International Executive Board"

      # What About The Guys?


      9 male-only groups, including 3 fraternities, remain.A 4 formerly
      male-only groups are now coed.


      The more established history of Harvard’s male-only organizations (and
      their powerful alumni) are believed by some to carry more weight inA
      resisting the sanctions, according to the Harvard Crimson.

      # BIGGER PICTURE


      ## Participation in ‘Greek Life’ decliningA overall.


      * **Alcohol-related** and/or **hazing-related violence** mayA deter
      membership; certain universities have simply suspended their “Greek Life”
      programs.

      * Others say a push towardA **gender inclusivity** is the cause.

      Harvard isn't alone. Recently, Wesleyan University and Trinity College
      mandated their fraternities & sororities be co-ed. Trinity's mandate
      lasted 3 years. Wesleyan's was also short-lived after a fraternity sued
      the school over it and won.
