      ## “The verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity was a bad verdict.”


      Patti Davis, President Reagan’s daughter to NPR in 2015


      In 2016, 34 years after a jury found him insane, a federal judge released
      Hinckley into the custody of his mother after doctors at the mental
      hospital where he lived for decades said he was no longer a threat.

      ## Jim Brady’s Lasting Legacy


      After he recovered, Jim & his wife Sarah became advocates for stricter gun
      control laws in the U.S.


      In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Handgun Violence
      Protection Act into law. The Act requires federally licensed firearms
      dealer (about 60% of all gun sales) to conduct background checks of
      potential gun buyers.

      In 2014, when James Brady died his death was ruled a homicide because he
      died as a result of the injuries he sustained 33 years earlier when he was
      shot, but prosecutors decided against charging Hinckley, and he was
      released just two years later.
