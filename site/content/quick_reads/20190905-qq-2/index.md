      Rakuten Securities Australia as the U.S. & China agree to postpone new
      tariffs and continue talks for 90 days. Meeting on the sidelines of the
      G20 Saturday, Presidents Trump & Xi's trade truce was broadly seen as
      "positive," but there is caution. If no deal is reached in 90 days, U.S.
      warns it will raise tariffs from 10% to 25%.

      Emily Grove of Anchorage, Alaska taking cover in her bathtub after
      back-to-back earthquakes measuring 7.0 and 5.7 rocked the area Friday,
      briefly triggering tsunami warnings. While Alaska has experienced powerful
      earthquakes over 7.0, it is rare for one to strike this close to a densely
      populated area.

      Rabah Mendez, protesting as part of the worst riots in a decade in Paris.
      Activists dubbed the "yellow jackets" have torched cars, looted shops, and

      doesn’t work all the time.”  
        
        
        
      Former First Lady Michelle Obama speaking to a sold-out NYC crowd for her
      new memoir Becoming about why sometimes women can't have it all. Obama
      went on to say the Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg's feminist mantra lean
      in, which says women should be assertive to overcome workplace inequities,
      doesn't always work. Becoming is the best-selling book of 2018.

      John Drennan after losing the engagement ring he used hours earlier to
      propose to his girlfriend of 10 years Daniella Anthony. The ring slid off
      and ended up falling 8 feet down a utility grate in Times Square. Police
      tried to help, but it was too dark. By Sunday morning, NYPD's emergency
      services unit had success and tracked down the UK couple to return the
      ring.
