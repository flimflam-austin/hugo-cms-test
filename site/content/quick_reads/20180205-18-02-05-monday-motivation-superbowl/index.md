      ‘Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not;
      nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not;
      unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is
      full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are
      omnipotent.’
