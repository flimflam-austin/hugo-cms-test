      > “It will be a source of great gratification to the many widows and
      orphans that have been made almost friendless by the Great Battle here, to
      have you here personally.”

      ## The Battle of Gettysburg


      * Brutal battle: July 1-3, 1863

      * 100,000+ Americans fought; 1 in 5 killed, wounded or missing.

      * Union soldiers pushed back Confederates, the victory arguably a tipping
      point in the war.

      * It took nearly another 2 years of fighting until the South officially
      surrendered.

      Gettysburg Address. Re-read the whole speech on our source page.
