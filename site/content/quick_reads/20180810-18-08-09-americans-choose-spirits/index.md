      ## Why Less Beer?


      * Craft beer competition (though that’s not making up for the shortfall in
      beer drinking completely).

      * ‘Sex In The City’ effect: Hit TV show – the cast made cocktails
      (specifically cosmos) cool.

      * Millenials drink less than older generation; choose drinks based on
      what’s perceived as healthier.

      Bud, finding local competition.

      mix are all feeling the pinch”_ (WSJ)
