      ## TX Early Voters Broke Records This Year


      * Texas voter turnout is usually low.

      * Ex: TX ranked 47th in voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election.

      * By Friday, at the end of the early voting, more than 885k Texans (52%
      Dems & 48% Reps) had cast their ballots – up more than 50% since the 2014
      midterm primary elections.

      In 2017, Texas gained just about 400,000 residents.


      **More Texans *MEANS*** **More Electoral Votes**
