      # BACKSTORY:


      In March 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from
      investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign.


      In May 2017, the Deputy Attorney General appointed Robert Mueller, the
      former FBI Director (2001 – 2013), as Special Counsel to oversee the
      Trump-Russia investigation.

      > “I did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty, but he was …. the charges
      were legitimate, but the prosecution tried to make the case about the
      Russian collusion ….. I think that they used Manafort to try to get the
      dirt on Trump.”  
        
        
        
      Paula Duncan, one of 12 jurors who decided the Paul Manafort case, to 'Fox
      News At Night.' Duncan, a Trump supporter, said she (and 10 of her fellow
      jurors) would've found Manafort guilty of all 18 counts but for one
      holdout juror.
