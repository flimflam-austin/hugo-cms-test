      meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister after he left office:  
        
        
        
      _“I met with him at a conference in Norway. I think I saw him in a
      conference in Munich at the World Economic Forum. So I’ve probably seen
      him three or four times.”_

      ## Why This Matters:


      * Private American citizens aren’t supposed to communicate with foreign
      officials to influence matters of national importance (“**The Logan
      Act**“).

      * **Context:** Some say Mike Flynn, Pres. Trump’s former national security
      advisor, violated the Logan Act when he spoke with the Russian ambassador
      before Trump’s inauguration.

      ## Logan Act


      * Named for a Pennsylvania Quaker Dr. George Logan, friend of VP Thomas
      Jefferson, who traveled to France in the late 1700s and tried to negotiate
      on behalf of the United States. President John Adams wasn’t happy. Hence,
      a new law.

      * **No one has ever been convicted of the Logan Act in more than 220
      years.**

    body: "> “I’ll leave the legal determinations to others. But what Secretary Kerry has done is unseemly and unprecedented. This is a former secretary of state engaged with the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, and according to him a\x13 right? You don’t have to take my word for it….He was talking to them. He was telling them to wait out this administration.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSec of State Mike Pompeo"

      ## ICYMI: Big Story


      **Important**: During his presser, Sec. Pompeo squarely blamed Iran for
      firing rockets at America’s embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in
      Basra.


      **What’s Happening**: Iran backs some Iraqi politicians, we support
      others. Iran blames the U.S. for stirring up dissent against the officials
      they support.

      Kerry admitted to speaking to the Iranian Foreign Minister about Yemen,
      Syria, and Iranian backed terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, and
      beyond. He says he has every right to speak to Iranian officials because
      past public officials, like Henry Kissinger, have done the same.
