      ## Why Do We Need It?


      * VP detailed concerns of other nations “weaponizing space” with efforts
      to develop satellite-killing rockets, citing threats from Russia & China.

      * U.S. is increasingly dependent upon satellites. National security, TVs,
      phones, GPS, weather prediction (i.e. agriculture), & finance (i.e.
      swiping your credit card) are all linked to space.

      > “There is a threat out there, but it is being handled by the U.S. Air
      Force today. It doesn’t make sense to build a whole other level of
      bureaucracy in an already bureaucratic DOD (Department of Defense).”

      ## Something to Consider


      President Trump cannot create a Space Force without Congressional
      approval.


      VP mentioned the request for funding will come in the President’s next
      budget (unveiled in February).


      **Remember:** Congress controls purse strings & allocating taxpayer money.

      VP Pence announced the Space Force because he's chairman of the National
      Space Council - a concept created under Pres. Eisenhower that was
      disbanded during Clinton administration. Trump ‘restarted’ it in 2017.

“When _you think about the history of this, people have forever believed that space was a sanctuary and it is not. It is becoming more contested, more congested and more competitive than ever before. And in order to preserve space, we have to be willing to defend it.” -A NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine_
