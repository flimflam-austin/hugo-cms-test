      ## Timing Is Everything


      New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gave birth to a girl named
      “Neve” on **June 21**.


      **June 21** would have been Pakistan’s late two-time Prime Minister
      Benazir Bhutto’s 65th birthday.


      In 1990, Bhutto became the **FIRST** world leader to give birth in office
      (She was assassinated in 2007).
