      # DACA Drama


      * Supreme Court will not hear an expedited legal appeal on DACA.

      * Trump administration requested The Supremes look at case when lower
      courts halted President Trump’s unwinding of the program.

      * DACA kicked back to lower courts. **Fate & timeline unknown.**

      **D**eferred **A**ction for **C**hildhood **A**rrivals:


      The 2012 Obama-era policy granted provisional work permits and temporary
      protection from deportation for nearly 800,000 young people brought to
      U.S. illegally as kids, but NO pathway to citizenship.

      ## How We Got Here:


      **Sept 2017:** President Trump announced repeal of DACA program & gave
      Congress until March 5th to come up with broader immigration reform.


      **January 2018:** California federal court issued a preliminary injunction
      halting repeal of DACA program & ordered gov’t to resume accepting DACA
      renewal applications.

      ## Why It Matters


      * Supreme Court’s decision not to hear appeal early says nothing about the
      merits of the case or how court might ultimately rule.

      * DACA recipients can continue to apply for DACA renewals while the
      California case works its way through the court system.

      * March 5th deadline is moot; Pres. Trump cannot cancel program during
      ongoing court challenges.
