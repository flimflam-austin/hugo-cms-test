      ## Good Catch-Up


      _“Facebook was hit with one of itsA biggest scandals everA when multiple
      outlets reported that a researcher’s app pulled personal information about
      270,000 users and 50 million of their friends, then passed that data to
      Cambridge Analytica.”_

      Why It Matters:  

      (Even If You Don’t Use FB)


      Here’s One Reason


      * Political ads, by law, have to be noted as such.

      * Reports say FB data was used by a private company to target
      voters/consumers.

      * Was the material clearly marked as political paid-for ads or was it more
      sinister to sway opinions?

      ## Big Take Away?


      Facebook knew back in 2015 that a professor shared data with a private
      company against their policies.


      Zuckerberg blames that company forA certifying data was erased and lying
      about it.


      Another way to look at it?A Facebook did not insure the data, collected
      against their policies, was erased.

      ## Important To Note:


      **FB says in 2014 they *already* made important changes.**


      **Before 2014:** when you signed up for an app using your FB Account, your
      friend’s contact could be accessed without them having the app themselves.
      **After**: If you sign up for an app, your contacts are protected unless
      your friends sign up too.

      ## What FB is doing NOW:


      1.A Investigate all apps on the platform; audit to make sure they are
      following rules.  

      2. Restrict access to data. When you use your FB account to sign inA for
      apps, less info will be shared.  

      3. FB putting an easier way for users themselves to be reminded what apps
      they have and restrict access.

      P.S. Birthdays, Addresses, of you and your friends through your FB
      accounts were easily shared in previous years. Where is all that info now?
      Who has it? What are they doing with it? Some lingering questions...
