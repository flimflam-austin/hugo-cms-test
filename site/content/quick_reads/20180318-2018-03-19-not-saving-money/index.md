      ## Encouraging Economy = NOT Encouraging Savings


      * Unemployment Rate is at a post-Recession low = **more employed**

      * Best wage growth since 2009 = **making more money**

      * Consumer sentiment at 14-year high = **growingA confidence in the
      economy**

      * S&P 500 (a gauge of stock market performance) is up 3% in 2018, after
      21% rise last year.

      # FINANCIAL FAIL


      > ‘With a steady, significant share of the working population saving
      nothing or relatively little, it’s virtually guaranteed that they’ll be
      unable to afford a modest emergency expense or finance retirement.’
