      ## LESSONS FROM THE PAST


      Why were certain American cities hit brutally hard by the 1918 flu
      pandemic while others were spared?

      _“Schools, theaters, churches and dance halls in cities across the country
      were closed. Kansas City banned weddings and funerals if more than 20
      people were to be in attendance. New York mandated staggered shifts at
      factories to reduce rush hour commuter traffic. Seattle’s mayor ordered
      his constituents to wear face masks.”_

      flu outbreak of 1918.

      ## WHAT TO KNOW:


      **What They Researched**: In 2007, the National Institute of Health funded
      two studies examining the government response to the flu pandemic of 1918.


      **What They Found**: Government intervention (containment/restrictions)
      worked to help slow the spread of the flu, but the real life-saving
      factor: **how quickly the measures were put in place**.

      ## One Example


      Both St. Louis and Philadelphia put similar measures in place, such as
      banning large gatherings.


      St. Louis put the ban in place 48 hours after first cases emerged.


      Philadelphia put the ban in place two weeks after first cases emerged.


      “Peak mortality” rates in St. Louis were 1/8 that of Philadelphia.

      ## WORTH NOTING


      > “… had San Francisco left its controls in place continuously from
      September 1918 through May 1919, the analysis suggests, the city might
      have reduced deaths by more than 90 percent.  
        
      Researchers concluded this about public measures: the earlier the better,
      and the longer imposed, the more effective. Many cities removed measures
      too early allowing re-transmission to occur.

      ## ONE LESSON?


      > “… in the event of a severe pandemic, cities will likely need to
      maintain (non-pharmaceutical interventions) **for longer than the 2–8
      weeks that was the norm in 1918**.”  
        
      Both studies note the challenges of comparing the past and present.
      However, both came to the conclusion that during a pandemic with no
      vaccine, public measures may need to be in place longer than previously
      believed.

      ## Something To Consider


      Researchers said finding precise public measures, their timing and how
      effective (how many people REALLY followed the guidance) is challenging.


      Some cities, like Philadelphia, handled a large influx of soldiers from
      WWI where others did not. This is one reason for the disease spread – but
      also a factor for concentrated mortality rates.

      "...nonpharmaceutical interventions may buy valuable time at the beginning
      of a pandemic while a targeted vaccine is being produced.” Dr. Anthony
      Fauci reacting to this 2007 study. Dr. Fauci remains at the NIH’s National
      Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, helping to lead the U.S.
      response to COVID-19.
