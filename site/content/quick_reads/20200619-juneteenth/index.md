      ## Historical Context


      * 1619: Commonly marked as the start of the African slave trade in the
      colonies.

      * By 1690, slaves existed in every colony.

      * By 1804, all the Northern states voted to abolish slavery, but slavery
      persisted in the North well into the 19th century since many laws took a
      gradual approach.

      * In 1861, the Civil War began.

      ## Emancipation Proclamation


      **Sept. 1862:** Pres. Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation
      Proclamation, which states “_all persons held as slaves… henceforward
      shall be free.”_


      * **Declared slaves free *in rebelling Confederate states*** & allowed
      them to join the U.S. military, effective Jan. 1863.

      * The 10 states weren’t under Union control, so it couldn’t be enforced.

      ## 13th Amendment


      **Jan. 1865:** Congress passed the 13th Amendment, which states “_neither
      slavery nor involuntary servitude… shall exist within the United States_.”


      * **Officially abolished slavery in the U.S.**

      * Adopted in Dec. 1865 after the required three-fourths of the states
      ratified it.

      * Did You Know? Due to a clerical error, Mississippi didn’t ratify the
      13th Amendment until 2013.

      ## June 19, 1865


      * Two months after the end of the Civil War, a Union general & troops
      arrived in Galveston, TX to notify slaves of the end of slavery and the
      Civil War.

      * Although it was 2-1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery
      persisted in Texas & other Southern states.

      * Slavery in the U.S. didn’t end swiftly, but June 19 is observed as its
      official end, also known as “Emancipation Day.”

      > “The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a
      proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.
      This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of
      property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore
      existing between them becomes that between employer & hired labor…”

      ## From Texas & Beyond


      * African-Americans began celebrating Emancipation Day on June 19, 1866.

      * In 1980, Texas became the first state to celebrate Juneteenth as a state
      holiday.

      * Today it is not a federal holiday, but at least 45 states & DC observe
      it. It’s a paid holiday for NY state workers.

      * Many businesses are also celebrating this year. Ex: Twitter, Nike and
      the NFL are giving their employees a paid holiday, and Chase will close
      early.

      Juneteenth has risen in national prominence this year amid a reignited
      conversation about race in America that has sparked both fervent civil
      discourse and unrest. Pres. Trump rescheduled a June 19 campaign rally in
      Tulsa, OK (the site of a historic 1921 race massacre) to June 20 because
      the rally fell on Juneteenth.
