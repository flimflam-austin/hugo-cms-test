      # Would you “Amazon” your health?


      * More than half of all American households have Amazon Prime.

      * Amazon “Smart Home” products (like Alexa) can relay information, give
      directions.

      * Whatever Amazon learns from health care venture with Chase/Berkshire
      Hathaway could be test for more public products.
