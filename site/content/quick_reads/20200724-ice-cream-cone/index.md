      * The inventor: An original foodie, Charles E. Menches.

      * A twist? Others who claim to have invented the ice cream cone *also*

      ## The Story Goes…


      Charles observed a girl(s) using baked goods for ice cream as a serving
      bowl.


      He took a cake, rolled it around his finger, and filled it with ice cream.


      _“It is from the time of the Fair that the edible ‘cornucopia,’ a cone
      made from a rolled waffle, vaulted into popularity in the United States.”_

      An Italian patented an ice cream cone concept in 1903 but it described
      "edible cups with handles." Charles and Frank Menches also claimed to have
      invented the hamburger. Read more about the heated controversy over "who
      owns the cone" on our source page.
