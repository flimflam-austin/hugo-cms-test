      > “The term ‘sexual assault’ means **any nonconsensual sexual act**
      proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim
      lacks capacity to consent.”

      ## Let’s Clear This Up:


      * Prof. Christine Ford has accused Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh nominee
      of **sexual assault**.

      * Despite her allegations, she hasA **not** filed a criminal complaint.

      * The Senate Judiciary cmte is **NOT** a court of law & they will not
      decide if a sexual assault happened. Instead, they vote on whether
      Kavanaugh should be considered for SCOTUS.

      Some in the media have chosen to use the umbrella term "sexual misconduct"
      to refer to the accusations against Kavanaugh; misconduct includes, but is
      not limited to assault. Thank you to our SmartHER reader who asked for the
      definition. Keep the questions coming. We are here to help!
