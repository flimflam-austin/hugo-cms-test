      ## Putin: Alleged Poisoning


      * Russia accused last week of using a nerve agent to attack 2 UK citizens
      (one a former Russian spy). World leaders, including U.S., condemned
      attack.

      * First public comments: Putin says it’s “nonsense” to think Russia would
      be involved before major election or before hosting World Cup this summer,
      but he’s ready to cooperate with investigation.
