      ## Something To Consider:


      * Younger Americans did the worst. Only 19% of those younger than 45
      passed the exam.

      * More than 70% of respondents couldn’t name original 13 colonies.

      * While survey was given to respondents on paper with multiple choice
      answers, those trying to pass citizenship test must answer questions
      verbally.

      Informed or not, voters are headed to the polls next month, and both
      parties use American history to bolster their platforms. The question is:
      do Americans know enough to understand what's true American history and
      what's not?
