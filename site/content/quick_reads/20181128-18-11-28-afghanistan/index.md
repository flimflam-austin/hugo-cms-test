      ## BIG PICTURE


      * Coalition combat missions (U.S. & NATO) ended in 2014, but approx.
      15,000 U.S. soldiers remain in Afghanistan supporting and training Afghan
      troops.

      * The Trump administration has allowed the military to operate more freely
      to target terrorists, but also reportedly wants to negotiate a “peace
      deal” with the Taliban.

      ## Something To Consider:


      > The Taliban now control more of Afghanistan than any other time during
      America’s longest war; al Qaeda remains a close ally of the Taliban.  
        
      _“Al Qaeda remains a threat. Its operatives are fighting in more countries
      around the world today than was the case on 9/11.”_

      ‘It is heart wrenching. Lando was an incredibly charismatic human beinga|
      and it’s hard to imagine someone like that gone. It’s like you feel a hole
      open inside of you that you didn’t even know was there... Andrea Brixey
      who taught Sgt. Jasso in middle school.
