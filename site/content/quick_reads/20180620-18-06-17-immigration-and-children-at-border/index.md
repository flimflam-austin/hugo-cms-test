      ## Why Separate Children?


      **Side effect** of Pres. Trump admin’s *new* “zero tolerance” policy – a
      **direct response to trying to deter surge of border crossings.**


      ANY adults crossing border illegally **will be arrested**A – Previously,
      an adult crossing illegally with child(ren) may not face prosecution.

      ## Children: What Happens?


      * Children become custody of Dep’t of Health & Human Services’ Office of
      Refugee Resettlement.

      * Children stay in care of HHS **on average** 50 days before a sponsor
      family found.

      * DHS: Last year, 90% of children released to sponsor who was either a
      parent or close relative.

      > “It is inconsistent with our American values to separate these children
      from their parents unless there is evidence of abuse or another very good
      reason. We need to fix our immigration laws, but using children is not the
      answer.”

      Watch For: Terms "parents" & "families" used in this debate. DHS says part
      of challenge of illegal immigration is "ascertaining parental
      relationship" for children. See inside a shelter for yourself:

As the Trump administration argues, referring immigrants for prosecution is not new policy. But prior administrations did not enforce the practice the way Trump has.Before Trump came into office, families were detained together, sent back immediately or paroled into the country, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Now, prosecution is happening across the board and has become the uniform policy.”The policy has ramped up substantially with the new administration,” Margulies said. “Making that a staple of immigration policy is a new feature.”
