      ## Not A Natural White


      “…a quality of toughness without brittle hardness.”  
        
      A description of the unusual sandstone used to the build the White House.
      The stone was not *naturally* white - but "light gray or tan, and is
      streaked or clouded with buff, yellow, or red colors that give it a warm
      tone," according to the U.S. geographical survey.

      ## Why “White” House?


      * **The Contrast**: Traditionally, buildings of the era were constructed
      in red brick.

      * **The “White Wash”**: The original sandstone weathered poorly so after
      the British burned parts of the White House in the War of 1812, repairs
      incl. white-washing & painting the exterior.

      * **The Style**: Irish-born architect modeled the White House from a
      famous, grand mansion in Ireland.

      ## “The Seat Of The Empire”


      * Pres. Washington chose the location of the “executive mansion”,
      strategically near rivers (& his home in Mt. Vernon).

      * Maryland & Virginia each gave a little land to create the District of
      Colombia.

      * D.C. straddles the North & South, “harnessing” wealthy southern states
      to help pay the federal gov’t’s war debt.

      * **What’s inside:** 28 fireplaces, 132 rooms, & 35 bathrooms. The
      President’s residence has 6 levels.

      Whoever "wins the White House" this year will follow a tradition of every
      U.S, president since Pres. John Adams, the first inhabitant, in 1800 - a
      full 8 years after construction began. Adams wrote the line on the front
      of our card stack in a letter to his wife Abigail a day after moving in.
