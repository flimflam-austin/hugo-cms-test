      Dinosaur sale was totally legal. U.S. laws say fossils found on private
      land belong to the landowner. But if it is a new species, who gets to name
      it? The auction house says one thing while the science world says another.

_Naming new species is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature, which award priority to the first validly published name, not to the owner of the specimen that formed the basis of that name, the society said._  
  
  
  
_Still, it”s unclear whether the owner was influenced by the near-promise made on page 51 of the auction brochure._  
  
  
  
_The buyer will be acquiring the skeleton of a dinosaur which could be named after them or after one of their children, with the agreement of the scientist who formally describes the species, the auction brochure states. One”s name would thus remain forever linked to a significant cultural and scientific event._
