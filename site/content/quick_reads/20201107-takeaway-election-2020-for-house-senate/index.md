      ## Balance of Power


      > Whoever sits in the Oval Office shares federal power with 535
      lawmakers.  
        
      What we know (so far) about what the 2020 election means for the House &
      Senate.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * **The House & Senate create and pass federal law; both have unique
      roles.**

      * **The House**: with lawmakers elected every 2 yrs, the House leads
      oversight (investigations) and manages your money (allocating taxpayer
      $$).

      * **The Senate**: with longer terms (6 years) and equal representation (2
      senators for each state) the Senate is a “necessary fence,” protecting
      citizens from wayward trends or rulers.

      ## House of Representatives


      Democrats currently hold the majority in the House (232 Democrats, 197
      Republicans, 1 Libertarian, 5 vacancies).


      Current race calls show Democrats maintaining the majority; however,
      Republicans have outperformed many predictions so far, and may gain more
      seats than expected.

      > “Last night and this morning’s results should serve as a wake-up call
      that the prognosticators have no clue what they are talking about,”


      Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee,
      after Election Day as predictions shift in favor of Republicans gaining
      seats. The majority party will still be able to pass legislation without
      the other. Whether or not election results will change political strategy,
      for either party, remains TBD.

      ## The Senate: TBD


      * Republicans currently hold the majority in the Senate: 53 Republicans,
      45 Democrats & 2 Independents (who vote with Democrats).

      * Current calls show Republicans maintaining Senate majority; however, two
      Senate races in Georgia — a state with razor-thin margins for the
      presidential race as well — may be too close to call. One race *will* head
      to a runoff; the other might do the same.

      > _“…get ready for nine more weeks of nasty campaign rhetoric, nonstop
      political advertising and even more visits from political VIPs, especially
      if control of the U.S. Senate remains at stake.”_


      Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Georgia law requires a runoff if neither
      candidate gets 50% of the vote. While both parties have local resources,
      "outside" money (from big donors) *is* permitted in these races,
      heightening attention & tension if the U.S. Senate hangs in the balance.

    body: >-
      While we can't call the presidency, remember this: Whoever is the VP
      serves as the tiebreaker in the Senate. Congress & the White House must
      work together to bring proposed legislation to law. Elected officials
      share the balance of power with the Judicial Branch - The Supreme Court
      justices have life appointments.

**ORIGINS of the SENATE:**

[https://www.senate.gov/history/origins.htm](https://www.senate.gov/history/origins.htm)

_During the Constitutional Convention, James Madison described the Senate as “a necessary fence” which would protect “the people against their rulers” and from “the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led.” Over the course of more than two hundred years, the Senate has expanded and evolved into a complex legislative body while remaining consistent with Madison’s vision, fulfilling the needs of a growing and increasingly diverse nation._

  
**ORIGINS OF THE HOUSE:**

[https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained)

_As outlined in the Constitution, the House represents citizens based on district populations, while the Senate represents citizens on an equal state basis. This agreement was part of what is called The Great Compromise which, in turn, led to the Permanent Seat of Government Act establishing the nation’s federal capital in Washington, DC. In 1789, the House assembled for the first time in New York. It moved to Philadelphia in 1790 and then to Washington, DC, in 1800._
