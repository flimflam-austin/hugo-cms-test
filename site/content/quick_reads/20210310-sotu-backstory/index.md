      ### On the eve of the President's first prime-time address to the nation -
      a lingering question about when he'll address Congress.


      ### **What's the tradition of the State of the Union?**


      ### What to know. Why it matters.

      The President _“shall **from time to time** give to the Congress
      Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their
      Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”_


      The Constitution does not stipulate when or how the President speaks to
      Congress nor mandate a "State of the Union" address, though the tradition
      dates back to Pres. Washington.

      ## What Is "Tradition"?


      * Recent tradition is that newly-elected presidents wait a full year
      before they give their first State of the Union Address to Congress and
      the nation.

      * What do they do in the meantime? Newly-elected Presidents typically give
      ***an address before a joint session of Congress*** outlining goals.

      * The tradition of addressing a joint session in this way during the 1st
      year of office began with Pres. Reagan in 1981.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Every president since Pres. Reagan has addressed a joint session of
      Congress *in February* during his first term in office. **Pres. Biden is
      the first one to not do so in 40 years.**

      * White House: Pres. Biden is focused on the pandemic & the COVID-19
      relief package, but they "intend" for the president to deliver a joint
      address and have "engaged closely" with Congress about future plans.

      While no date has been set (so far) for Pres. Biden address to Congress,
      tradition says he doesn't have to talk at all – for about 100 years what's
      now called the State of the Union address was delivered in writing.
      Meanwhile, Pres. Biden's prime-time address Thursday night will mark a
      year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a "pandemic."
