      Italy Elects New Gov’t  

      Why It Matters


      * Italy: European Union (EU) founding member country; symbolic & economic
      importance.

      * First election in 5 years – will determine gov’t for next 5 years.

      * No clear winner, but Euroskeptic, anti-establishment parties gained most
      votes, & ruling center-left party lost ground. **This marks a change.**

      Word To Know:  

      “Euroskepticism”


      **_Euroskepticism_:**


      Political platform that doubts the benefits of a unified Europe aka “EU” &
      advocates for its dismantling.


      _New York Times:_ “That anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as a strong dose
      of **euroskepticism**, swept Italy this election season.”

      ## Key Issues: Immigration & the Economy


      **600K** have migrated to Italy since the last election in 2013.


      **8th largest global economy** is growing, but debt is at the 2nd highest
      level in Euro area.

      # No Clear Winner?


      * **5-Star movement & Center Right Coalition** win most votes.

      * Any party or coalition needs more than 40% support to win enough seats
      to govern. **None did.**

      * Meant to encourage coalition building, but may end in a “hung
      Parliament.”

      * Experts say 2017 changes to Italy’s election laws make it harder for one
      single party to win.

      > ‘Bottom line: Italy is far from having sorted its longstanding problems,
      and now it will have new ones. Be prepared for long and complex
      negotiations that will take months.”
