      ## “Are You a U.S. Citizen?”


      * **Commerce Dept** says question (a Trump administration request) is
      necessary to better measure the voting-eligible population.

      * **Critics** say question will cause undercount of immigrants &
      minorities who might be afraid to disclose such information.

      * **Not a first:** From 1820-1950 every census included a question about
      citizenship.

* Commerce Department’s announcement to include citizenship question:A [https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/03/us-department-commerce-announces-reinstatement-citizenship-question-2020](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/03/us-department-commerce-announces-reinstatement-citizenship-question-2020)
* Decision to add citizenship question to census draws protest  
_Census counts are taken by mail and by workers walking neighborhoods. The Census Bureau says that the 2010 census drew a massive response, with about 74 percent of the households mailing in forms and the remaining households counted by workers in neighborhoods.A_ [https://apnews.com/df9a6812fe144a429de1eeb5d3294134/Decision-to-add-citizenship-question-to-census-draws-protest](https://apnews.com/df9a6812fe144a429de1eeb5d3294134/Decision-to-add-citizenship-question-to-census-draws-protest)

* The announcement of the citizenship question comes at a troublesome time for the Census Bureau: Its top two positions have interim occupants, and it has been forced toA skip two of its three trial runsA for the 2020 census because of funding shortfalls. If response rates for the census are low, critics worry that the bureau may be unable to adjust the data or deploy enough census takers to low-response communities.
