      # Speaker of the House


      ## Why It Matters:


      The leader of the House of Representatives supervises administrative
      duties within the House and serves as the top representative of elected
      officials (aka congressmen/women) nationally & especially, before the
      President.

      ## History


      * **Mandated by Constitution** (but no official rules on HOW a Speaker
      should be elected).

      * Modeled after British House of Commons. The Speaker kept order over
      elected officials representing the “Average Joes.” Speaker spoke for the
      monarchy within the Commons…while ALSO speaking for elected officials
      before the monarchy.

      ## Will Republicans Lose Majority In The House?


      * Speaker Ryan joins **40 other Republicans not seeking re-election** Nov
      2018; Dems need to win 23 seats for the majority.

      * Speaker Ryan could’ve run for re-election, win & then retire – securing
      a Republican seat. Ryan said he just couldn’t lie to his constituents
      about his intent.

      So who will be the next Speaker of the House? You could be! Why? Because
      the Speaker doesn't have to be an elected official, even though he/she's
      always been one.
