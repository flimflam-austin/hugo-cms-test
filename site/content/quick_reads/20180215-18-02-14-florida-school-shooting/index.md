      ## Former Student In Custody


      > ‘We were told last year that he wasn’t allowed on campus with a backpack
      on him. There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I
      guess he was asked to leave campus.’

      Your Family & The News


      _“Parents should also monitor how much exposure a child has to news
      reports of traumatic events, including these recent school shootings.
      Research has shown that some young children believe that the events are
      **reoccurring** each time they see a television replay of the news
      footage.”_
