      # Why It Matters:


      * Iran = State sponsor of terror since 1984 and no friend of the USA.

      * Iran supports Syria’s Pro-Assad forces – Syria is key territory &
      strategic ally for Iran.

      * Investigation into crash continues.

      * If confirmed, this will be first time Israeli plane shot down by enemy
      fire since 1982.

      IMPORTANT:  

      Within The Last Week…


      * U.S. military, working with Anti-Assad forces inside Syria, attacked by
      Pro-Assad forces, with Russia support.

      * Russia & Iran align with Pro-Assad forces in Syria.

      * U.S. responded with major bombing campaign.

      escalation could pave the way for a regional or international war given
      the fact that the big powers are directly present on the ground…’
