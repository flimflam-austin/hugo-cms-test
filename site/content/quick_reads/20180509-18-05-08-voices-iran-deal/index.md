      > “(Iran) can opt to have a functioning economy, free of sanctions and
      open to investment, at the price of permanently, verifiably and
      irreversibly forgoing a nuclear option and abandoning their support for
      terrorists. Or they can pursue their nuclear ambitions at the cost of
      economic ruin and possible war.”

      > “The President absolutely made the right decision to pull out of the
      Iran nuclear deal. This was a terrible deal that only allowed Iran’s bad
      international conduct to worsen. We must never allow Iran to get nuclear
      weapons, and we must resist their support for terrorism that continues to
      threaten America and our allies.”
