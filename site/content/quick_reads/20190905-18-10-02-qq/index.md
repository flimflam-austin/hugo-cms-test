      Nurdiyah Rasid who lived through a powerful earthquake and tsunami in
      Palu, Indonesia - a city of nearly 400,000 people; 1,200+ have died in the
      aftermath and that number continues to rise. An early warning system for
      tsunamis hasn't worked since 2012. Officials used text message and social
      media to try to warn residents but the location of the earthquake produced
      almost an immediate tidal surge.

      day a large service industry union will lead protests around the country
      advocating for higher pay; Amazon has been pressured to do the same.
