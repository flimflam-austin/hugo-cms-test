      ## Impressive Performance


      UMBC jumped out early & never trailed Virginia in the 2nd half.


      Stunning not only that they won, but how certain the outcome was for the
      last 15 mins of the game.


      At 11:06ET UMBC’s website crashed.


      @UMBCAthletics gained 13K Twitter followers in last 2 mins of game.
