      # US v. Paul Manafort


      Pres. Trump’s former campaign manager is the **first to face a criminal
      trial stemming from the Special Counsel** **investigation** into Russian
      interference in the 2016 election.


      Yet **none of the charges** against himA relate to his work on the
      campaign or the President.

      ## Why It Matters:


      Manafort faces 18 charges, which although unrelated to the 2016 election,
      are very serious; he could go to prison for the rest of his life.


      Legal experts debate whether Manafort has information that could be
      detrimental to Pres. Trump and, if so, whether he would use it to
      negotiate?

      Manafort's VA trial is expected to last about three weeks, but delays are
      fairly certain. Either way, his first trial should be done in time before
      his D.C. trial is expected to begin in mid-September.
