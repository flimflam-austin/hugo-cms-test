      ## The Case for More Taxes


      > “In your average social democratic European country, you **pay more
      taxes**, but you also **get a lot in return: universal health coverage,
      free child care, generous paid family leave, & free college**, for example
      … there are things you just don’t have to worry about, **things that keep
      us Americans up nights**.”
