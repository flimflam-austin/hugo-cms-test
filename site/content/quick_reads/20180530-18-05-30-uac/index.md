      ## UAC 101


      * When UAC arrive in U.S., they are transferred from the Dep’t of Homeland
      Security to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

      * While their legal status is being sorted out, the ORR places most UAC
      with “sponsors” in the U.S.

      * The sponsors are usually their parents or close family members.

      * ORR periodically checks in to monitor their safety & well-being.

      their sponsors.

      determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 UAC**.”

> “U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a “zero-tolerance” policy to increase prosecution of immigrants who come into the country illegally.  
  
  
  
In cases where a parent crosses illegally with his or her child, the parent will be referred for prosecution and the child directed to HHS for care and custody while the child”s immigration case is resolved.  
  
  
  
At a May 15 Senate committee hearing, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said that families who present themselves at ports of entry seeking asylum are able to stay together. “
