      ## Why This Matters


      **Andrew McCabe’s firing is part of a larger investigation with high
      stakes.** The DOJ Inspector General is looking into whether or not members
      of the FBI tried to unfairly influence investigations based on political
      beliefs. If the conclusion is yes, that means corruption at the highest
      law enforcement agency in America. **Answer: TBD**
