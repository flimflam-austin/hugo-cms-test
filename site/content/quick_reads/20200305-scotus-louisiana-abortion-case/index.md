      ## About U.S. Abortion Laws


      * _Roe v. Wade_: A case heard before the Supreme Court in 1973 that
      legalized abortion **with limits**; a woman’s right to an abortion is
      *not* absolute.

      * Abortion is legal in the 1st trimester but states can regulate and, in
      some cases, outlaw abortion at certain points in the pregnancy, *unless*
      there is a threat to the health/life of mother.

      * **BIG PICTURE:** This is why states have different laws.

      ## BACKSTORY  



      * **2014:** Louisiana law (Act 620) requires abortion providers to have
      admitting privileges at a hospital w/in 30 miles of the abortion site. The
      law never took effect due to legal challenges.

      * **2017:** Trial court struck it down. Finding only 1 clinic/doctor would
      be able to perform abortions, court ruled it placed an “undue burden” on
      women.

      * **2018:** Federal appeals court disagreed, reversed the trial court’s
      decision.

      ## Important Context


      * Under current legal precedent, states cannot pass laws that impose an
      **“undue burden**” on the right to access abortion.

      * In 2016, the Court struck down a nearly identical law to Louisiana’s out
      of Texas, finding it imposed an “undue burden” on those seeking abortions.

      * Supreme Court has changed since 2016. Pres. Trump appointed justices –
      Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.

      > “The true, and often overt, intent of legislators behind pretextual laws
      like Act 620, which have no demonstrable medical benefit, is to severely
      restrict, and ultimately eliminate, access to legal abortion under the
      guise of patient welfare.”  
        
      A friend-of-the-court brief filed by 197 congressional Democrats arguing
      the law should be struck down because its goal is to chip away at abortion
      rights - not to make abortions safer. Groups like Planned Parenthood and
      22 state attorneys general filed similar briefs.
    _key: df70edb23c81
  - order: 5
    body: >-
      > “The burdens of Act 620 are minimal—principally, a modest increase in
      the waiting time (less than an hour) to obtain an abortion. The benefits
      described above are more than sufficient to justify that burden.”


      A friend-of-the-court brief filed by the Trump administration, urging the
      court to allow the law to go into effect to protect women. A similar brief
      was filed by more than 200 Republican (and two Democrat) members of
      Congress.

      ## Louisiana Abortion Law


      * Current state law prohibits abortion after 20 weeks & requires two
      doctors visits before an abortion may be performed.

      * 2019 law (not in effect because of legal challenge) bans abortions if a
      fetal heartbeat is detected (approx. 6 wks).

      * Some say Louisiana is on the forefront of protecting life; others say
      it’s spearheading efforts to outlaw abortion.

      The Supreme Court likely will issue a decision before July. States like
      New York and Illinois have tried to expand access to abortion. States like
      Arkansas, Alabama and Indiana will wait to see what happens with this law
      to see about passing further laws restricting abortion.
