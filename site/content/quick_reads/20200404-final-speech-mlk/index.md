      > “We’ve got some difficult days ahead. … Like anybody, I would like to
      live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about
      that now. I just want to do God’s will … I may not get there with you. But
      I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised
      land.”
