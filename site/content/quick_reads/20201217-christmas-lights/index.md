      ## ‘Tis The Season For Lights


      Shortly after presenting his electric incandescent bulbs, Thomas Edison
      adorned his lab with a strands of lights during the Christmas season.


      In 1882, his partner, looking for a safer alternative to the open flames
      of lit candles, built his own set of electric lights for his Christmas
      tree – but due to concerns about cost & safety, it took years for the
      trend to spread.

      Today, it's estimated that over 150 million sets of lights are sold each
      year as part of the $230+ average spent by each American on decorations
      and other non-gift holiday items. Take a peek at *what many believe* is
