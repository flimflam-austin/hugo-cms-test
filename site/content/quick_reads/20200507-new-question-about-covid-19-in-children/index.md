      ## The Backstory


      **Monday:** NYC Health Dept. issued alert after flagging 15 children with
      similar symptoms hospitalized since mid-April.


      **Patients:** Aged 2-15 years old; some tested positive for COVID-19 (or
      antibodies) while others tested negative.


      **Symptoms:** Similar to toxic shock and/or “Kawasaki disease” (an illness
      that causes inflammation), persistent fever.

      > “We want to reassure parents – this appears to be uncommon.”  
        
      Dr. Jane Newburger, Dir of the Kawasaki Program at Boston Children’s
      Hospital, in a statement released by the American Heart Association on
      Wednesday. The group says, though rare, "some children are becoming very
      ill extremely quickly" and list symptoms as "persistent fever,
      inflammation & evidence of single or multi-organ dysfunction" and "may or
      may not test positive for COVID-19."

      ## Why It Matters:


      This bulletin from NYC is corroborated by reports from doctors in Europe
      and the U.S, (mainly on the East Coast) and notably in areas with high
      COVID-19 infection rates.


      Health officials have been baffled at the low rates of COVID-19 among
      children — this raises questions about a more nuanced, rare response in
      otherwise healthy children.

      ## Something To Consider


      The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among U.S. children remains low.
      However, children are not extensively tested.


      According to the most recent CDC data, about 21,000 Americans under 18
      tested positive for COVID-19, a small percentage of the 1M+ cases.

      For context - the 2019-2020 flu season was particularly deadly for
      children under the age of 4 (CDC reported 170 deaths), and had
      historically-high hospitalization rates for those under 18 years old.
