      > “Even though Brian’s non-verbal, he has a lot to say! People should know
      autism isn’t just people who are good at math, like you see in the movies.
      Autism varies greatly. Each person with autism is unique.”  
        
        
        
      Ben Duff, SmartHer News tech-guru, and loving father of Brian, who's been

      Autism  

      What We Don’t Know:


      * NO agreement among the scientific community on the cause.

      * NO official medical test to diagnose autism. It’s often diagnosed after
      other medical conditions are ruled out based on behavioral developmental
      delays.
