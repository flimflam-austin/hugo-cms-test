      > ‘The study found that that pasta **didn’t contribute to weight gain or
      increase in body fat**. In fact analysis actually showed a **small weight
      loss**.’

      ## But…Why Did Pasta Lead To Weight Loss?


      Researchers aren’t 100% sure…but say : _“lower-GI foods have been shown to
      be **more satiating** and **delay hunger** and **decrease subsequent
      energy intake.**_


      Translation? **A little pasta may have made eaters feel fuller, longer.**
