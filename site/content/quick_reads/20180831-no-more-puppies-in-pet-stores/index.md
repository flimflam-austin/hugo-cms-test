      ## England’s Proposed Ban


      * **What**: Ban sales of puppies & kittens younger than 6 months old by
      anyone EXCEPT breeders.

      * **Why**:A Crackdown on puppy mills & poor treatment of animals.

      * **Interesting**: England doesn’t track puppy sales – no clear idea of
      how many puppies are actually being sold through pet stores; estimates
      upwards of 80,000.

      ## Puppy Probs: Stateside


      * Americans spending more $$ on their pet’s care & comfort: est. $70B this
      year.

      * CA passed a law banning the sale of puppies in pet stores by 2019.

      * MD passed a similar law this year.

      * **Why keep pets in pet stores?** Some argue pushing all sales to
      breeders will push puppy sales “underground” and same mistreatment to
      occur.

      ## The Benefit Of A Ban


      > _“_(Bans) protect consumers who may unwittingly purchase sometimes sick
      or genetically compromised puppy mill puppies from pet stores. They
      promote the acquisition of shelter/rescue dogs instead of commercially
      bred dogs …. Nationally, they pressure the commercial pet industry to
      clean up its act.”

      The proposed ban of puppy and kitten sales in English pet stores opened
      for public commentary in late August and will close in mid-September
      before it goes before Parliament; a ban to stop sales of pets younger than
      8 weeks old starts on Oct. 1.
