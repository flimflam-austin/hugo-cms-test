      ## Pres. Lincoln’s “Support”


      * **Catafalque:** a frame that supports a coffin (cat-e-falk).

      * Pres. Lincoln’s catafalque from 1865 has held most of the coffins that
      have lain in state.

      * The catafalque has had minor restorations since 1865 (retrofitted to
      hold larger coffins, drapery replaced), but for the most part, it remains
      like the original.

      ## “In State” vs. “In Honor”


      Average citizens cannot **“lay in state”** as that honor is reserved
      for_**gov’t & military** officials.


      However, **eminent private citizens** may **“lay in honor.”**


      To date, only four have received the honor, including Rev. Billy Graham &
      two police officers killed during an attack on the U.S. Capitol.

      In 2005, civil rights activist Rosa Parks became the first (and only)
      woman to "lay in honor" in the U.S. Capitol.
