      “Being a father is the thing I am most proud of in this world; it’s my
      greatest accomplishment. I’ve learned so much, but perhaps the most
      profound thing has been the fierce, unconditional love you have for your
      children when you become a parent. I’m blessed to have had that experience
      four times now and there’s nothing more powerful in this world.”

**Dear Basketball**  
[https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/dear-basketball](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/dear-basketball)

> _Dear Basketball,_  
  
  
  
_From the moment_  
_I started rolling my dad’s tube socks_  
_And shooting imaginary_  
_Game-winning shots_  
_In the Great Western Forum_  
_I knew one thing was real:_  
  
  
  
_I fell in love with you._  
  
  
  
_A love so deep I gave you my all —_  
_From my mind & body_  
_To my spirit & soul._  
  
  
  
_As a six-year-old boy_  
_Deeply in love with you_  
_I never saw the end of the tunnel._  
_I only saw myself_  
_Running out of one._  
  
  
  
_And so I ran._  
I ran _up and down every court_  
_After every loose ball for you._  
_You asked for my hustle_  
_I gave you my heart_  
_Because it came with so much more._  
  
  
  
_I played through the sweat and hurt_  
_Not because challenge called me_  
_But because YOU called me._  
_I did everything for YOU_  
_Because that’s what you do_  
_When someone makes you feel as_  
_Alive as you’ve made me feel._  
  
  
  
_You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream_  
_And I’ll always love you for it._  
_But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer._  
_This season is all I have left to give._  
_My heart can take the pounding_  
_My mind can handle the grind_  
_But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye._  
  
  
  
_And that’s OK._  
_I’m ready to let you go._  
_I want you to know now_  
_So we both can savor every moment we have left together._  
_The good and the bad._  
_We have given each other_  
_All that we have._  
  
  
  
_And we both know, no matter what I do next_  
_I’ll always be that kid_  
_With the rolled up socks_  
_Garbage can in the corner_  
_:05 seconds on the clock_  
_Ball in my hands._  
_5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1_  
  
  
  
_Love you always,_  
_Kobe_
