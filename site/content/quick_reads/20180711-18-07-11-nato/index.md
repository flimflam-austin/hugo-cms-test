      ## What’s The Drama?


      * At NATO summit, Pres. Trump criticized member countries (again) for not
      contributing more to common defense.

      * Pres. used term “inappropriate” several times describing biz deals
      Germany has with Russia while not contributing more to NATO & wanting U.S.
      protection (aka $$$);A described situation as unfair to American taxpayer

      > “…Germany is just paying a little bit over 1 percent, whereas the United
      States, in actual numbers, is paying 4.2 percent of a much larger GDP.A So
      I think that’s **inappropriate** also.A You know, we’re protecting
      Germany, we’re protecting France.A We’re protecting everybody.A And yet
      we’re paying a lot of money to protect.”  
        
        
        
      President Trump, July 11, 2018

      > “I agree with you that we have to do make sure that our allies are
      investing more.A The good news is that allies have started to invest more
      in defense. After years of cutting defense budgets, they have started to
      add billions to their defense budgets.A And last year was the biggest
      increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada in that
      generation.”

      ## Why Timing Matters?


      * NATO troops deployed to areas like Poland as a way of countering an
      emboldened Russia (Russia ignored international borders & “took” Crimea
      from Ukraine).

      * Pres. Trump criticized NATO members (who want protection from Russia)
      AND pointed out their own relationships w/the Kremlin before his mtg
      w/Russian Pres. Putin next week in Helsinki.

      Is NATO worth the investment? One commentator says: "The issue is not
      whether NATO is still useful, but whether the alliance can reform itself
      before it implodes."

* **10 things you need to know about NATO: [https://www.nato.int/cps/su/natohq/126169.htm](https://www.nato.int/cps/su/natohq/126169.htm)**
* **Is NATO Worth Preserving? (from 2016)A** The Soviet Union has collapsed, Germany is now in the European Union, and the EU has a larger population and economy that the United States. But Putin”s Russia is still nuclear and aggressive. It expands anywhere it senses weakness. Germany still earns suspicion in Europe, whether because of Chancellor Angela Merkel”s destructive immigration policies or the equally unwise practice of rich German banks recklessly lending to bankrupt Mediterranean nations. The European Union never managed to unite its disparate nations into something cohesive and similar to the individual states of America.In sum, a powerful Russia will always have to be watched. A dynamic and headstrong Germany will always have to be integrated into some sort of military alliance. And the United States will always have a natural self-interest in preemptively keeping kindred Europeans from killing each other.The West is increasingly under assault. It is the target of radical Islamic terrorists, it is losing its deterrence with Russia and China, and it is seen as weak by rogue regimes such as Iran and North Korea.The issue is not whether NATO is still useful, but whether the alliance can reform itself before it implodes.
