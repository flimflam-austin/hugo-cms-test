      # DOWN, BUT NOT OUT

      ## The Big Picture


      > “**The U.S. doesn’t really know how many fighters ISIS has**, but it is
      clearly enough to continue launching daily attacks across Iraq and Syria,
      while also fighting in several other countries. **It is a mistake to think
      ISIS is defeated and the US needs to ensure it doesn’t mushroom once
      again**.”

      ## Something To Consider:


      * **30,000:** UN & DOD estimate of ISIS fighters in Iraq & Syria alone

      * Positive: America’s **military** **defeat** of ISIS, & the terrorist’s
      loss of territory in Syria.

      * However, power of ISIS loyalty / ideology remains. “ISIS’ resilience”
      mentioned in both reports;A **$2B U.S. dollars** has gone to the Iraqi
      Security Forces to support fight vs. ISIS.

      Turkey, a NATO member, has both provided a gateway for ISIS fighters &
      suffered from ISIS terrorism. America planned to work w/Turkey vs. ISIS
      strongholds in Syria. As tension rise between U.S, & Turkey, the way
      forward remains uncertain & Russia lurks in the background.
