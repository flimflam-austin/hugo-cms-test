      the haters & losers. We have our hostages, testing, research and all

      > ‘North Koreans are very tough to deal with. They don’t think like we do.
      We think in terms of a compromise, quid pro quo. You do this, we do that.
      Their idea of negotiating is they’ll give you more time for you to get to
      their position.’
