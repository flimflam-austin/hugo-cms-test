      ## Syria: Did You Know?


      * History of **secular rule** & tradition of religions living together
      including Christians & variety of Muslim denominations.

      * **Educated public but struggling economy** – only about 1/4 land
      useable, low quality oil, high unemployment.

      * Current population roughly the same as Pennsylvania: 13M (about 5M
      refugees dispersed).

      ## Tension Builds


      * Syria experienced droughts & dust storms 2006 – 2011. One expert
      compared this time to the “dust bowl” during America’s Great Depression.

      * During roughly the same time period Syria’s relationship with America
      soured, U.S accused Syria of allowing transport of foreign fighters into
      Iraq to kill American soldiers.

      ## U.S. & Syria


      * Diplomatic relations began in 1944, but have gone “off-and-on” over the
      years for many reasons.

      * U.S. listed Syria as State Sponsor of Terror since 1979. **America’s
      interest in Syria arguably lies in containing terrorism a long with
      Syria’s ally, Iran.**

      * U.S. embassy in Syria closed 2012. U.S. forced closure of Syrian embassy
      in DC in 2014.

      Location Matters. Part of Syria's importance to America has less to do
      with Syria and more to do with the Middle East overall. We couldn't fit it
      all on one card...Check out "The Backstory" Syria: Iran & Russia"
