      ## North Korea & Cuba


      * Maintain **diplomatic relations**.

      * Both show **disdain for USA.**

      * Closed & struggling economies.

      * Shared trade i.e. in 2013 – Cuban weapons on board aA North Korean ship.

      * Soviets supported the birth of North Korean & Cuban dynasties. **Modern
