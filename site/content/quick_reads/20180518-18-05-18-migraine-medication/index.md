      ## What’s The Breakthrough?


      * For decades, researchers believed a protein (**CGRP**) was connected to
      migraines.

      * By blocking *some* of these proteins on a cellular level, migraines
      lessen.

      * Other big drug companies are working on similar treatments – **Could
      this change the course of migraine treatment forever?**
