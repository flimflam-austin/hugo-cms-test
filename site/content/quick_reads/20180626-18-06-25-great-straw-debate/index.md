      ## The Great Straw Debate

      First, plastic bags.  
      Now, plastic straws?  
      Straw bans span coast to coast, but stir up questions.

      Why Now?

      ## Why Hate On Straws?


      “Straws are a luxury, we do not need straws to have our drinks, and I
      think it’s an easy step forward where we can have a great impact for our
      environment.”  
        
      Brooklyn City Councilman Rafael Espinal who introduced a straw ban for
      America's largest city in late May, following previous official bans in
      Seattle, Oakland & Miami Beach.

      ## Impact? Data Debate


      * You’ll see this number A LOT: **Americans use an est. 500,000,000 straws
      a day** (that would mean every single American uses more than 1 straw a
      day).

      * **That estimate is based on a 9-year-old’s research project.**

      * Whatever the number, debate continues on whether straws are public enemy
      #1 for pollution.

      ## The Last Straw?


      * Straw ban part of renewed focus on reducing plastic in the ocean. 60-80%
      of all marine debris is composed of plastic: WCS.

      * Study looking at efficacy of general plastic bans says **initial results
      encouraging,** but **more research needed**.

      * Other study: fishing gear, balloons & plastic bags = biggest threat to
      ocean life, doesn’t name straws.

      The patent for the first straw was approved in 1888, but a patent for
      "drinking tubes" for disabled Americans came before that - another
      argument against the straw ban is it will hurt the disabled who depend on
      straws to drink.
