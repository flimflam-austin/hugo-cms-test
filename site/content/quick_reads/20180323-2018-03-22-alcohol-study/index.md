      > ‘We were supposed to be preventing alcoholism, so to spend that kind of
      money on research for a possible good use of alcohol was something that
      would never fly.”

      Uh-Oh That Seems  

      Like A No-No


      The **fundraising may have violated N.I.H. policy**, which prohibits
      employees from soliciting or suggesting donations, funds or other
      resources intended to support activities.


      At the very least, it may raise questions about the **scientific integrity
      of the trial**.

      The N.I.H. is now investigating the fundraising outreach. Nevertheless,
      the NYT reports the study "may well be the last word on the subject of
      moderate drinking, since trials like these are both expensive and
      logistically complicated to carry out."
