      Can’t Lose Weight?  

      Blame Your Brain


      Scientist discover mental “switch” that determines whether we store
      calories to burn or to hoard.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * When we successfully diet, our bodies burn stored fat.

      * When we stop dieting, our bodies can start storing fat in anticipation
      of being hungry again, instead of burning calories as they come in.

      * Scientist have discovered a way to potentially “turn off” our bodies’
      desire to store fat after dieting.

      * Could help with yo-yo dieting and obesity therapies.

      Protein: Potential Link  

      Your Brain & The Scale


      > “Manipulating this protein offers the opportunity to trick the brain and
      not replace the lost weight through increased appetite and storage of
      fat.”
