      ## The Race Into Space


      In 1961, three years after the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik
      satelliteA into space, Pres. Kennedy announced his goal of sending an
      American to the moon by the end of the decade (and before the Soviets).


      On July 16, 1969, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Mike Collins, blasted off for the
      moon. They accomplished their mission & returned 8 days later.

      # A New Era of Space Exploration?


      It’s been more than 45 years since NASA went to the moon.


      Astronauts say politics & costs are largely to blame.


      Today, support for NASA is bipartisan and Pres. Trump’s 2019 budget
      allocates $$ for a trip to moon, and eventually, a visit to Mars.

      The Apollo 11 astronauts left behind a U.S. flag, a patch honoring the
      Apollo 1 crew, and a plaque reading: "Here men from the planet Earth first
      set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."
