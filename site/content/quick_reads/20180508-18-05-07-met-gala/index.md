      ## Toughest Ticket in Town


      The **invitation-only tickets** are $30K a piece & tables are about $275K,
      according to NYT.


      All of the money from ticket sales goes to the **Costume Institute,**
      which it needs because it is the only one of the Met’s departments that
      funds itself.


      Last year, $12 million was raised.
