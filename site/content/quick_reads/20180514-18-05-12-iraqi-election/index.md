      ## What’s At Stake


      * Current PM (Haidar al-Abadi) seen as more independent, more
      U.S.-friendly, than his challengers, who align more closely with Iran,
      politically or religiously.

      * Who wins will determine future relationship of U.S. & Iraq.

      * ISIS led to massive displacement of **diverse Iraqi population**. Next
      leader will have a major role in Iraq’s demographics & geography.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * **RECORD LOW turnout at 44%**. Turnout usually approx. 60% _(that
      roughly matches voter turnout in America’s 2016 presidential election_).

      * First election since the start of the Iraq war (2003) whereA **no
      bombings were reported at ANY polling site**.

      No clear winner...yet. Once parliament is elected in Iraq (nearly 400
      seats), members have 3 months to form a government. A coalition of
      politicians backed by Muqtada Al-Sadr has an early lead. Sadr led a
      militia that fought/killed U.S. troops during Iraq War.
