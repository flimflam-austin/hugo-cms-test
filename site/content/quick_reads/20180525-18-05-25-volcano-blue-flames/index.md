      ## Wait… BLUE Flames?


      When the lava buries plants, methane gas is produced. Methane can seep
      into the ground & produces a blue flame when ignited.


      The blue flames are only visible at night, making it hard to judge how
      widespread they are.


      Scientists are now concerned the methane may cause explosions.

      Mother Nature has put on quite a show... Kilauea’s eruption has also
      generated earthquakes, gushing molten rock, giant ash plumes & sulfur
      dioxide. No sign when it will end, but scientists say its similar to one
      in 1955 that lasted 3 months.
