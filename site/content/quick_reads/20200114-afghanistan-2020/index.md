      ## Something To Consider


      > “The Taliban has publicly stated its goals of the so-called ‘peace
      talks’ is the **complete withdrawal of US forces** and the
      re-establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the official name
      of the Taliban’s government.”  
        
      Bill Roggio, Long War Journal editor. Reports have indicated peace talks
      were set to resume between the U.S. & Taliban this week overseas.

      ## Why This Matters


      Although not designated a terrorist group by the U.S. gov’t (an area of
      great debate) the Taliban provide safe haven to terrorist groups that have
      attacked America, most notably the 9/11 attackers.


      The Taliban and Al-Qaeda remain longtime allies. Concerns remain that
      Afghanistan, left to the Taliban, will once again become a breeding ground
      & launching pad for terror.

      Pres. Trump cancelled talks with the Taliban in September after the group
      claimed to have killed a U.S. soldier. In November, during a Thanksgiving
      visit to Afghanistan's Bagram Airfield, the President opened the door for
      restarting peace talks. The base was attacked by the Taliban weeks later.
