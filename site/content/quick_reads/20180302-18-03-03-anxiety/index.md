      ## About the Study:


      * 80 participants screened on their levels of anxiety & then asked to
      study a set of words

      * Next, the words were shown to them over various images – some neutral
      pics & some negative.

      * Only difference in their memory recall? Those with high levels of
      anxiety remembered the words more accurately when they were shown over the
      negative images.

      > ‘I think a practical takeaway from this study is to be aware of the
      biases you’re bringing to the table and know that they might affect how
      you’re seeing everything and remembering it later.’

Overall, that could mean that anxious people have a memory advantage over non-anxious people, says Fernandes, especially in emotional situations. But it also has a downside: It shows how people can adopt a negative retrieval mode when recalling events, which could lead to biased memories. _For people with high anxiety, the emotional context in the background tainted their later memory of these words that were otherwise neutral_, says Fernandes.A Co-author Christopher Lee says most people have probably experienced this type of memory bias at some point. _Say you”re having the worst day possible—you slept through your alarm, you slipped and fell in mud—and then the barista atA StarbucksA asks you a totally neutral question, like if you want whipped cream on your mocha_, he says. _Because you entered this situation in such a negative mindset, you may remember him being rude or hostile or horrible for some reason, even when he”s not._
