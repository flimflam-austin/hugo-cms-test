      ## You’re hearing one thing from the President on COVID-19 about social
      distancing; another from your governor. Maybe something else from your
      mayor.


      ## Who takes the lead?

      ## FEDERAL GOV’T


      * Under the Constitution, the job of the federal government is to prevent
      the spread of highly contagious diseases into the country & in between
      states.

      * The federal gov’t may limit entry into the U.S., order those inside the
      U.S. to remain under quarantine and/or isolation, and restrict interstate
      travel.

      * The last widespread federal quarantine: the 1918 flu epidemic.

      ## STATE & LOCAL GOV’T


      * State & local governments help enforce federal quarantine & isolation
      orders, and control the spread of diseases within their borders.

      * States may order their own quarantines or less-extreme measures (ex:
      stay-at-home orders). Generally, federal orders supersede state & local
      ones.

      * Currently, various cities and states have implemented stay-at-home
      orders.

      ## Stay-At-Home Orders


      * Each stay-at-home order varies, but the goal of each is the same: to
      mandate social distancing.

      * Generally, the orders require most residents to avoid leaving home
      except for necessary activities: i.e., to access medical care, obtain
      must-have items (ex: food), or run essential errands (ex: walk the dog).

      * Stay-at-home violations are usually misdemeanors.

      ## BIG PICTURE


      The **federal gov’t takes the lead** in the case of **widespread
      communicable diseases** but needs teamwork from the states.


      The policies put into place recognize states are in the best position to
      know how to serve their own needs. For example, the federal gov’t is
      deploying National Guard troops to 3 states, but each state’s governor is
      directing them.
    _key: e1c891cf8d31
  - order: 5
    body: >-
      The President is deploying the National Guard to California, New York &
      Illinois. These states have stay-at-home orders or similar measures in
      place: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana,
      Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, New Jersey, & New York. Massachusetts & West
      Virginia orders take effect Tuesday.
