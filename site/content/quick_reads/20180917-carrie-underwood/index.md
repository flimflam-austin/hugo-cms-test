_But when she thought she might be suffering a fourth miscarriage, I got mad, Underwood told CBS News” Tracy Smith._  
**_One of her most emotional moments came as she cuddled with her son and thought,A Why on Earth do I keep getting pregnant if I can”t have a kid? Like, what is this? Shut the door. Like, do something. Either shut the door or let me have a kid._**  
_And for the first time, I feel like I actually I told God how I felt, she added. That was like a Saturday — and the Monday I went to the doctor to, like, confirm, another miscarriage. And they told me everything was great!_  
___She said, He heard me._
