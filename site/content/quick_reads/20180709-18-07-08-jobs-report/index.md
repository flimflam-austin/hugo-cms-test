      ## Jobs Report 101


      * You are counted as part of the labor force if you are **able** to work,
      **want** to work, and **actively** looking for work.

      * More Americans started looking for work last month – a **good sign that
      reflects optimism**.

      * The **labor force grew by 601,000 people**, reflecting more people
      looking for a job and the unemployment went up slightly.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * **Latino unemployment rate fell to a record low;** more women and blacks
      looking for work.

      * **Wages continue to increase** – an important sign of healthy job
      market. However, when adjusted for inflation, the **take-home pay is
      essentially flat to last year**. Possible reason? More Americans fill
      lower paid jobs during summer months (AP).

      ## National vs. Local


      > While overall job picture positive, the numbers differ state-to-state.  
        
        
        
      CNBC: Some important swing states like Michigan have seen unemployment
      rates rise.  
        
        
        
      “The jobless rate was also higher than the national average in Arizona,
      Mississippi, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, all states Trump carried in
      2016.”

      Don't forget the impact of potential aluminum & steel tariffs on
      Mexico/Canada/Europe for swing states like Michigan/Pennsylvania. A
      lingering question: What do the tariffs on China (and China tariffs on
      U.S.) do to the U.S.? economy & job market? More To Come.
