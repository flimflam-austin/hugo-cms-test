      # Important Analysis


      “The indictment **does not allege collusion** between Russia and the Trump
      campaign and **does not assert that Russia’s deeds tipped the election**
      in Trump’s favor. But Mueller’s **investigation continues** and nothing is
      ruled out.”

      ## Why It Matters:


      * **Symbolic move** by U.S. laying out where the investigation into
      Russian election interference stands.

      * This does **NOT** signify the end of the investigation.

      * Do not expect the case against the Russians to play out in court.

      * This is the **FIFTH** round of indictments handed down by the Special
      Counsel team.

      > _“**Americans of all political stripes** must see this charging document
      as a **wake-up call**. We must not let partisan divides between
      Republicans and Democrats blind us to the threat, nor bind us to
      inaction.”_
