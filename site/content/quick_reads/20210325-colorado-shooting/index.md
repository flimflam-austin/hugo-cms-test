      “He always suspected someone was behind him, someone was chasing him.”


      Ali Aliwi Alissa, the 34-year-old brother of the shooter, who said he
      "kept a close eye" on his brother in high school because of his increasing
      paranoia. Fmr. classmates described the shooter as "joyful" at times, but
      quick to enrage. There is no known mental health diagnosis of the shooting
      suspect at this time.

The shooter was known to local law enforcement; this report suggests he was also known to federal authorities, raising questions about why and to what extent. How this figures into the investigation is TBD."

      The alleged shooter is expected to appear in a Colorado courtroom on
      Thursday. His brother added in an interview: "I never thought he would
      kill. I still can't believe it. I am really sad for the lives that he
      wasted, and I feel sorry for all those families. ... We lost a brother
      even if he is the killer."
