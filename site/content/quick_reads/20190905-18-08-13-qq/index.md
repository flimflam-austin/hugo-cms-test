      A text from Forrest Gordon Clark, suspected California arsonist, to Mike
      Milligan, Holy Jim Volunteer Fire Department Chief. The Holy fire has
      forced evacuations of 20,000 as it burns in two of California's most
      populous counties: Orange & Riverside. Clark is facing $1M bail and
      according to reports, he initially refused to face the judge due to fears
      of "retaliation."

      > ‘Monsanto made Roundup the OxyContin of pesticides, and now the
      addiction and damage they caused have come home to roost.’  
        
        
        
      Ken Cook, Environmental Working Group President, as a California jury
      awarded $289M to a former school groundskeeper who sued Monsanto saying
      its weed killers, including Roundup, gave him non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The
      case is the first of thousands of lawsuits in state & federal courts
      alleging Roundup causes cancer, a claim Monsanto denies.
