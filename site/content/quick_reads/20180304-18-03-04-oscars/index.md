      _According to an analysis by the Women’s Media Center:_


      Women make up **23%** of 2018 nominees in behind-the-scenes roles –
      **that’s a small, but significant increase**.


      From 2005 – 2016, **less than a fifth** of non-acting nominations went to
      women.

      In an interview with CNN, Mudbound's Rachel Morrison said "Sure, there's
      the historical significance of it all, but just seeing me get the
      accolades that have been [denied so many women in the past] has really
      been the light at the end of the tunnel for so many women and the
      encouragement they needed to keep shooting."
