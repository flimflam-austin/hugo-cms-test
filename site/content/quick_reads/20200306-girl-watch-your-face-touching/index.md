      ## “I haven’t touched my face in weeks…in weeks! I miss it!”

      ## SCHOOL


      **Study**: University of New South Wales observed 26 medical students.


      **Findings**: On average, students touched their faces an average of 23
      times per hour or 184 times over an 8-hour period.


      Nearly half the face-touches involved contact with a mucous membrane
      (nose, mouth, eyes).

      ## WORK


      **Study:** University of California, Berkeley observed 10 participants (5
      men and 5 women) in an office setting for 3 hours doing “office-type work”
      such as reading or working on a laptop.


      **Findings:** Participants touched their face on average 15.7 times per
      hour or 125.6 times during an 8-hour period.

      ## OUT AND ABOUT


      **Study:** National Institutes of Health (NIH) observed 249 people in the
      Washington D.C. subway and in a city in Brazil to measure how often we
      touch a “common item” (like a railing or subway pole) and then touch our
      mouth or nose.


      **Findings:** People touched their faces on average 3.3 – 3.6 times per
      hour in public where the possibility of hand-washing wasn’t readily
      available.

      “We therefore suggest a **shift** in the focus of the recommendations
      issued during outbreaks toward ensuring that individuals understand how
      self-inoculation occurs and **thus avoid touching their faces**… Although
      built on the influenza pandemic experience, this suggestion should be
      **equally relevant for other respiratory pathogens that can be the source
      of severe outbreaks**.”

      Researchers suggest reminding people to wash their hands to prevent
      illness is good, but telling them to stop touching their faces may
      actually be BETTER during times of respiratory epidemics.
