      ## What’s Happening


      A civil war rages inside Yemen: “Houthi”A Rebels vs. Yemeni gov’t.


      U.N.-led talks between the 2 sides take place in Geneva this week.


      Rebels backed by Iran; Saudis back the Yemeni gov’t (as does U.S.).


      **Big Question:** Do talks help the 4-year conflict or make situation
      worse?

      The U.N. described the conditions in Yemen as an "apocalypse." Millions
      don't have basic needs. U.S. Defense Secretary recently said America's
      support of Saudi Arabia has to include an effort to avoid civilian
      casualties.
