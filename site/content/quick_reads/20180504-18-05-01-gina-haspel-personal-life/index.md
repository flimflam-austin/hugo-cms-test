      # OUR TOP SPY?


      > “It was right out of a spy novel. It really didn’t get any better than
      that.’  
        
      America finally hears from acting CIA Dir Gina Haspel about her life as a
      spy. As Fmr. Dir Mike Pompeo works his first full week as Sec. of State,
      attention shifts to whether or not Congress will confirm Haspel as FIRST
      female CIA Director.

      ## Background


      CIA started releasing more personal info on the notoriously secretive
      Haspel for “Women’s History Month” in March – under the umbrella of
      honoring women in the CIA.


      Critics say this is “propaganda” by CIA to deter from questions about
      Haspel’s record on torture.

      ## Critics Say:


      > “While the CIA has been trying to salvage Gina Haspel’s rocky nomination
      to lead the agency with a series ofA gushing tweetsA and by making public
      only flattering bits of her record, the American people have to reckon
      with a nominee whose role in torture and the destruction of torture
      evidence is still shrouded in secrecy.”

      ## DO NOT MISS THIS:


      * Major media outlets (NPR, NYT) issued corrections on reporting re: Gina
      Haspel.

      * **Haspel did not oversee a CIA black site in Thailand DURING the torture
      of an infamous terrorist; she assumed role *after* that incident.**

      * Questions remain as to Haspel’s role destroying CIA torture tapes.
