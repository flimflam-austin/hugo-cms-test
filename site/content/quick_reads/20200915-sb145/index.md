      A newly-amended California sex offender law steps into the national
      spotlight.


      What’s Going On


      Why It Matters

      ## BACKGROUND


      * Federal law requires that every state maintain a sex offender registry,
      but like all criminal laws, sex offender registry requirements vary by
      state.

      * State laws differ regarding WHO must register, how LONG they must
      register, & the TYPE of information about sex offenders publicly
      available.

      * This month California amended its sex offender law with respect to who
      is ***required*** to register as a sex offender.

      ## FORMER LAW


      In cases when the victim was 14 or older and the offender was not more
      than 10 years older than the victim:


      * Judges had **discretionary** authority to decide whether an adult
      convicted of having **vaginal sex** with a minor was required to register
      as a sex offender.

      * Adults convicted of having **oral or anal sex** with a minor were
      **automatically** required to **register** as a **sex offender**.

      ## NEW LAW


      In cases when the victim is 14 or older and the offender is not more than
      10 years older than the victim:


      * Judges have **discretion** to decide whether an adult convicted of
      having **any sex** (vaginal, oral, anal) with a minor is **required** to
      **register** as a **sex offender**.


      The new law does NOT apply to victims under 14 years of age.

      > “I cannot in my mind as a mother understand how sex between a
      24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever
      not be a registrable offense.”


      CA assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D). Under the newly-amended law, no
      offender is *automatically* required to register as a sex offender *when*
      the victim is 14 or older and the offender is not more than 10 years older
      than the victim; critics say it's legalizing pedophilia.

      > “It’s appalling that in 2020, California continues to discriminate
      against LGBTQ people…”


      CA State Sen. Scott Wiener (D), who introduced the bill, says the previous
      law did not treat heterosexuals and homosexuals equally, forcing judges in
      some scenarios to put LGBTQ young people (for example a 19-year-old male
      engaging in sex with a 17-year-old male) on the sex offender registry. He
      argues the amended law gives judges more discretion.

      The nation's most populous state can serve as a bellwether for future
      state laws. CA was the first to legalize medical marijuana (1996), and
      became the second state to legalize same-sex marriage (2008). In 2016, the
      state's voters -- along w/Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada -- legalized
      recreational marijuana.
