1. _Corrections are generally temporary price declines interrupting anA uptrendA in the market or an asset. A correction has a shorter duration than aA bear marketA or aA recession, but it can be a precursor to either._ [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp#ixzz56INQF1hw](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp#ixzz56INQF1hw)
2. Stocks simply had too many buyers at the start of the year. In fact, more than $100 billion flowed into stocks globally at the beginning of 2018, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.A The Dow’s massive dropA was the market’s way of “unwinding” the excess price gains that had built up, says Tom Essaye, editor and founder of a financial newsletterA The Sevens Report. The selloff has been sparked by inflation fears and worries that interest rates could rise faster than expected. Those fears stemA fromA a strong employment report released FridayA that showedA wage growth for hourly workers over the past year had risen nearly 3%, its quickest pace since 2009.
