      ## Monday: KOKITO


      During a flight from Houston to New York, a flight attendant ordered the
      owner of a french bulldog named Kokito to put the puppy in its carrier in
      the overhead compartment.


      The family said they heard Kokito barking for two hours, but when the
      plane landed, Kokito was dead.

      ## United’s Response:


      “We have learned that the customer did tell the flight attendant that
      there was a dog in the carrier. However, our flight attendant did not hear
      or understand her, and did not knowingly place the dog in the overhead
      bin. As we stated, we take full responsibility and are deeply sorry for
      this tragic accident.”

      United announced it will implement a new policy: "To prevent this from
      happening again, by April we will issue bright colored bag tags to
      customers traveling with in-cabin pets. This visual tag will further help
      our flight attendants identify pets in-cabin."
