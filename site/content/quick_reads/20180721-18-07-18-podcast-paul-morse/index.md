      > “There was a certain graciousness about all of them…and when the cameras
      aren’t on them, the true personalities are there and they’re really
      exceptional people and we base our opinions on the presidents about little
      snippets on the news, politics and things like that…the stress that they
      bare is really really remarkable.’
