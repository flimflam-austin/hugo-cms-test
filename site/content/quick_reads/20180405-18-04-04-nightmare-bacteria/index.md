      ## Whats YOUR real risk?


      * Can be spread person-to-person (without anyone even getting sick).

      * Spreads via health care equipment (IV, etc).

      * Higher risk if you receive health care in another country (many with
      “nightmare bacteria” in 2017 had received medical care in another
      country).

**Important:** Context for this study isn’t available – It’s the first of its kind: “..this was the beginning of the surveillance and so it”s just the first nine months. I can tell you that I was surprised by the numbers that we found. This was more than I was expecting. But it”s the beginning of looking. We hope though that this won”t be an inevitable march upward, but that by finding them early when there”s only one in the facility we can stop this from becoming very, very common. So we don”t have any trend data.” Read More:A [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/t0403-antibiotic-resistant-germs.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/t0403-antibiotic-resistant-germs.html)
