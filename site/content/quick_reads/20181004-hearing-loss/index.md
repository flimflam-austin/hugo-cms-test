      ## How Do You Lose Your Hearing Anyway?


      **Overexposure to loud sound** kills off tiny hair cells in your ear that
      transmit sound signals to your brain.


      Once damaged, these **cells don’t grow back** and you have hearing loss.


      **2 out of 3 people over age 70** have trouble hearing.

      > ‘You can certainly hurt your hearing listening to loud music, whether
      through earbuds or something else. But earbuds and listening to music with
      earbuds are not a major cause of hearing loss.’  
        
        
        
      Dr. Robert Dobie, clinical professor of otolaryngology at the University
      of Texas Health Science Center. One of Dr. Dobie's March 2017 studies
      found rates of hearing loss have actually fallen among adults aged 20-69.

      ## Stopping It Before It Starts


      * **Wear both headphones.** We use both ears to gauge sound, with just one
      in, you tend to turn it up.

      * Current MP3 players can’t be turned as loud as those in the 80s & 90s,
      but one audiologist warns newer ones might be worse because **more**A
      **people listen for longer periods of time.**

      * **60/60 Rule:**A volume at less than 60% with breaks every 60 mins.

      ## Not Your Grandpa’s Hearing Aid


      Hearing aids have gone high-tech now answering phone calls & calculating
      user’s steps.


      Costing approx. $3-5K & rarely covered by insurance, only 20% of those
      over 70 wear one.


      New law allows over-the-counter hearing aids by 2020 for just $80.

      Which headphones are safest? Experts recommend noise-canceling ones,
      especially in loud places. You're less apt to crank up music to drown out
      background noise, but experts warn they're not a good option when you need
      to hear outdoor sounds - like when running.
