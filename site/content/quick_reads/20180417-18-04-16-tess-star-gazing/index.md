      ## MEET ‘TESS’


      **T**ransiting **E**xoplanet **S**urvey **S**atellite


      (Lost you at “Exo”? Us too)


      TESS is a NASA spacecraft, roughly the size of a flying refrigerator,
      **expected to launch this week** on a crucial 2 year mission to quite
      literally scan the universe for stars.

      ## STAR SCANNER


      * TESS will fly a **2 yr mission**

      * Goal: Scan 500,000 stars, incl **500 “earth-like” planets**.

      * Think of it like taking a “census” of the universe.

      * **Why?** Current telescopes can’t examine certain planets (they’re too
      far away); by charting stars & planet movements, TESS will help NASA
      decide where to prioritize further focus & exploration.

      > ‘By looking at such a large section of the sky, this kind of stellar
      real estate, we open up the ability to cherry-pick the best stars for
      doing follow-up science.”  
        
        
        
      Researcher Jenn Burt, MIT, part of a collaborative TESS team. TESS missed
      the initial launch date of April 16 due to an issue with the Space X
      rocket it was hitching a ride on - will try again April 18th, 2018
