      ## Get Me Up to Speed


      * Last year, Disney offered $52B for a big stake in 21st Century Fox.

      * Then Comcast decided to get in on the action, offering $65B.

      * Disney isn’t having that & just last week raised its offer to $71B,
      which Fox says is a superior bid.

      * Ball is now in Comcast’s court: will it up the stakes even more?


      Oh the drama...

      ## $71B?! Why So Much?


      * **What Disney & Comcast want:** Fox’s stake in Hulu (streaming service)
      & Hollywood studios with TV & film franchises (Think: X-men & The
      Simpsons).

      * **Bottom line:**A Real driver is the fear of the future with digital
      rivals like Amazon, Facebook & Netflix disrupting content, advertising &
      distribution. Media cos. need to get in the game to compete.

      Whoever wins in the end - Disney or Comcast - it's important to note Fox
      would retain some assets, including Fox News and Fox Broadcasting Company.
