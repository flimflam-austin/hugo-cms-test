      ## Why Now?


      * Pres. Trump reacting to a NYT op-ed by former Supreme Court Justice who
      said he supports the repeal the 2nd Amendment.

      * This fueled further fear by some Americans that gun confiscation and/or
      repeal of the 2ndA Amendment is the true intention of “gun control”
      movement.

      Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html)

      ## 2nd Amendment


      There’s endless debate as to what the 2A *actually* means, how it should
      be applied today, and why it was included in the Bill of Rights, but
      here’s what it says:


      **_“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
      State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
      infringed.’_**

      Amendment Repeal 101  

      2 Possibilities: Both Tough


      **Option 1:** Requires approval of a new by two-thirds of the House &
      Senate AND ratification (approval) by three-fourths of the 50 states.


      **Option 2:** Requires two-thirds of states’ legislatures to hold
      Constitutional Convention where amendments must be approved by
      three-fourths of the 50 states.

      In our nation's history, only ONE amendment has ever been repealed. In
      1933, the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the
      making, transportation and sale of alcohol, and put an end to Prohibition.
