      ## Yes, He Was THAT Nice.


      > _“The greatest thing we can do is show people they are loved and capable
      of loving.”_  
        


      * Rogers was a Protestant minister, composer &A student of behavior.

      * When the TV was introduced, he saw the need to make it a tool to help
      children.

      ## He Worked Tirelessly.


      > _“If we in public TV can only make it clear that feelings are
      mentionable & manageable, we will have done a great service for mental
      health.”_  
        


      * Up before 5AM, the vegetarian, who didn’t smoke or drink, would swim
      laps before work.

      * He wrote scripts, songs, created the characters & puppet voices – all of
      which were some facet of his personality.

      ## He Was Really Very Funny.


      > _“I would like to do a program for people who are just about to go to
      sleep… We’ve heard that this slow-paced voice of mine can put people to
      sleep. So why not use it in that way?”_  
        


      * Loved to get a laugh telling jokes or talking in puppet voices at home.

      * Monty Python fan.

      ## The Cardigan Was Special


      > _“I guess that’s the best thing about things. They remind you of
      people.”_  
        


      * Many of the two dozen he wore were knitted by his mother.

      * He wore one every day as part of the comforting ritual that opened the
      show.

      * One is on display at the Smithsonian.
