      Why It Matters:  

      March 5 DACA Deadline


      * Trump says he will rescind DACA on March 5 without broader reform. DACA
      provides temporary legal status to those brought here illegally by
      parents.

      * Pres. Trump open to allowing DACA recipients legal status or even
      citizenship in exchange for broader reform (ex: border wall $$$).

      # Important To Note


      * DACA deadline set by President Trump in doubt after two federal judges
      block WH move to rescind DACA.

      * Trump administration asked Supreme Court to review the case.

      * If Congress compromised on broader immigration reform, deadline & court
      cases might be irrelevant.
