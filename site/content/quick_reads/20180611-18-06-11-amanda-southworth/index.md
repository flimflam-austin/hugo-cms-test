      > ‘I can honestly say that technology has saved my life. When I found
      something greater than myself, I realized that I am not just a person with
      a life. I am a person who has something to contribute.’

      > “Everything in my life has shown me that both good and bad things in
      this world will continue to happen and that’s out of our control. But it’s
      what we do with the things that happen to us that can make all of the
      difference.”
