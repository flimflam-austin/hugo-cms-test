      NYC v. CHICAGO:  

      The Final Verdict ===================================


      > In 2011, the late Supreme Court JusticeA Antonin Scalia weighed in:  
        
        
        
      “_**I do indeed like so-called ‘deep dish pizza…. But it should not be
      called pizza. It should be called a tomato pie. Real pizza is Neapolitan.
      It is thin. It is chewy and crispy, OK?**A_ ”
