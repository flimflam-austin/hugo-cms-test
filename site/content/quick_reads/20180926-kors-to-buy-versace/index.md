      ## Why it Matters


      Deal creates America’s first true **luxury fashion** **conglomerate**.
      (Tapestry, which owns Coach, Kate Spade & Stuart Weitzman, is more
      mid-to-high-range.)


      America has the **largest apparel market in the world**, but has yet to
      produce a global, multi-brand company like European names Gucci or
      Christian Dior.

      Some Things to Consider:  

      Fashion is Fickle


      * **Too much, too fast?**  

      _“Kors just bought Jimmy Choo 11 months ago,”_ a Wells Fargo analyst
      warns.

      * **Discounting concerns:**  

      _‘Time to get Versace at your local TJ MAXX and Marshall’s,”_ tweetedA
      writer Danielle Ayoka.

      Donatella Versace has served as the fashion house's creative director
      since her brother Gianni, who founded it 1987, was famously murdered in
      1997. She had no training in fashion, but Kors CEO says she's an
      ‘essential component’ and will stay on to oversee the brand.
