      lives, not just after a tombstone saying that is put over you. You deserve
      **more than Thoughts and Prayers**, and after supporting us by walking out
      we will be there to support you by raising up your voices.”

      ## Agree or Disagree?


      > “Prayer isn’t a lazy activity that people rely on in place of taking
      action…The problem isn’t that critics are calling for action, it’s that
      they have completely skipped over the necessity of faith and the power of
      prayer to sustain victims and to help those who have been tragically
      impacted by these horrors.”

      Is prayer, the usefulness or lack-of, a priority of debate in the hours
      after a mass shooting? What do you think?
