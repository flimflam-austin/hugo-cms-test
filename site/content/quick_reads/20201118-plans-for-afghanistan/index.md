      ## The Latest


      The Pentagon announced U.S. troop levels will be reduced in Afghanistan
      and Iraq – leaving roughly 2500 troops in each country.


      U.S. troops will continue to _“defend”_ embassies and _“the other agencies
      of the U.S. gov’t doing important work…They’ll defend our diplomats and
      they’ll deter our foes.”_ White House National Security Advisor Robert
      O’Brien

      > “I believe these additional reductions of American troops from terrorist
      areas are a mistake… (The Taliban have) done nothing — met no condition —
      that would justify this cut.”


      Congressman Mac Thornberry (R-TX), ranking Republican on the House Armed
      Services Committee, on the troop drawdown -- from an est. 4,500 soldiers
      in Afghanistan to 2,500, & from an est. 3,000 troops to 2,500 in Iraq. The
      U.S. has held "peace talks" w/the Taliban & Afghan gov't.

      ## Context To Consider:  

      Afghanistan


      * The Taliban currently control more territory than at any point in the
      war.

      * The Taliban provided “safe haven” to al-Qaeda to train and plan the 9/11
      terrorist attacks. Reports: The relationship between the two groups
      remains strong.

      * The Islamic State has also made inroads in Afghanistan (at odds w/the
      Taliban).

      ## Context to Consider: Iraq


      > “Our goal is to keep ISIS at a level where ultimately they’ll be able to
      be handled by local security elements with minimal assistance from any
      other entity — to include external entities like the coalition, NATO, or
      us.”  
        
      Gen. Frank McKenzie, U.S. Central Command in September, continuing that
      Iraq was a "little ways away from that" but improved from past years.

      ## The Timeline


      * Pres. Trump promised to reduce American troops overseas as part of his
      platform to end “endless wars.”

      * According to the Pentagon’s announcement, troops would return home by
      January 15th – 5 days before inauguration day for the next presidential
      term.

      * This move may present a challenge to an administration pursuing a
      different strategy.

      ## Why This Matters:


      * Thousands of Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq &
      Afghanistan. Tens of thousands injured. Millions of American families
      impacted by deployments.

      * Debate continues about how the U.S. can best confront, defend against &
      ultimately destroy Islamic terrorism.

      * Lingering question: What does it take to win? What’s the most effective
      use of U.S. forces?

Insight on the [link between the Taliban and Al Qaeda](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2020/11/veteran-al-qaeda-leader-killed-in-western-afghanistan.php):

> Mohammad Hanif is the perfect example of how Al Qaeda has integrated Pakistani jihadists into its rank and file. He was killed in Farah province. Of course, if you listen to the Taliban, Al Qaeda doesn't even exist in Afghanistan… [https://t.co/IIDrzfXA6v](https://t.co/IIDrzfXA6v)
