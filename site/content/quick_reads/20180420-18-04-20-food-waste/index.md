      ## DECIPHERING THE LINGO


      **“Best if used by”:** refers to quality, not safety. Recommended for
      flavor.


      **“Use by”:**A date on products that could become less safe as they age.


      **“Sell by”:**A tells the store how long to display. Issue is quality not
      spoilage.


      **“Expiration Date”:**A last day to eat. Proceed at your own risk.
