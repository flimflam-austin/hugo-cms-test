      ## Trade Faceoff Heats Up


      Handbags, fish sticks, blow torches and copper – just a few items on the
      list of Chinese goods getting hit with a new tariff or tax.


      The White House says **Americans won’t feel the pinch**; others say
      **Christmas shopping just got more expensive**.

      > “Because it’s spread over thousands and thousands of products, nobody is
      actually going to notice it at the end of the day.”  
        
        
        
      Commerce Sec. Wilbur Ross responding to a question about how the new round
      of 10% tariffs on $200B of Chinese imports this week will impact the
      American consumer. If the White House doesn't see a change from China by
      January the tariff jumps to 25%.

      > ‘Every time this trade war escalates, the risk to U.S. consumers grows.
      With these latest tariffs, many hardworking Americans will soon wonder why
      their shopping bills are higher and their budgets feel stretched.”  
        
        
        
      Matthew Shay, President and CEO of the National Retail Federation. Other
      experts agree and say as Chinese imports cost more, these higher prices
      will start hitting consumers around the holidays.

      ## Why Now?


      * **America is China’s #1 customer; China is a HUGE market for American
      companies.**

      * WH says China doesn’t trade fair: makes it difficult for U.S. biz to
      enter their market, requires companies to share research, & uses cyber
      espionage to steal our intellectual property.

      * China is retaliating withA tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.

      This is the second round of tariffs the White House has levied on China to
      force a change in their trade policy. Currently, there are no talks
      scheduled between the two countries. U.S. has the strength of low
      unemployment & a record high stock market.
