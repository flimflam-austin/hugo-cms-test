      Two hair stylists develop symptoms for COVID-19.

      They keep working regardless … with 100+ clients.

      The CDC says what happened next illustrates the power of wearing masks.

      ## Backstory


      * New study focuses on transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 in a
      hair salon in Springfield, Missouri.

      * **Stylist A** developed respiratory symptoms. She took a COVID-19 test
      on day 6 of her illness but kept working with clients for 8 days, when her
      test came back positive.

      * **Stylist B** developed symptoms, and worked for 5 days before
      self-isolating and testing positive 2 days later.

      ## What Happened


      * 139 clients, ranging from 21 to 93-years-old, were exposed to the two
      stylists.

      * Both stylists wore masks throughout the 15-45 minute appointments, as
      did nearly all of the clients.

      * **No clients reported COVID-19 symptoms in the following weeks.** About
      half agreed to be officially tested – zero tested positive for SARS-COV-2
      (the virus that causes COVID-19).

      ## Something To Consider


      While both stylists wore masks *during* client appointments, they did not
      wear masks *between* appointments when interacting with each other.


      * Stylist A’s contacts developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19
      (her husband, daughter, son-in-law and roommate).

      * Stylist B’s contacts did not develop symptoms.

      ## Why This Matters?


      * As states start to “shut down” their economies during an increase in
      infections, this new report suggests masks may help _“to reduce the impact
      and magnitude of additional waves of COVID-19”_ according to the CDC.

      * **However**, the CDC notes scientists don’t fully understand how
      SARS-COV-2 is transmitted & researchers did not track clients who
      interacted with stylists BEFORE symptoms.

      Important: Not all clients had on the same masks - some had cloth, other
      had medical masks. The stylists all wore cloth masks.
