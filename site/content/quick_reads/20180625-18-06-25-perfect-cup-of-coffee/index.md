      # Why Study This?


      ## Researchers Say:


      * 1/3 of Americans experience sleep loss.

      * Sleep loss impacts our performance and quality of life.

      * Caffiene can boost our performance when used correctly – so they
      developed “an app for that.”


      How It Works

      ## How Does It Work?


      The app uses an algorithim that considers your sleep cycle and how much
      caffeine you plan to consume – and then spits out what you should drink
      and when.


      Researchers found users upgraded their performance by more than 60% &
      ironically reduced their caffeine consumption by more than 60%.

      ## Cappucino?


      * 6 out of 10 Americans drink coffee daily – this has held steady over the
      last several years.

      * Coffee drinkers consume nearly 3 cups on avg. every day.

      * Women drink _slightly_ more coffee than men.

      * Previous Research: 500 mg of caffeine (2 cups of coffee) or lower = best
      health benefits.
