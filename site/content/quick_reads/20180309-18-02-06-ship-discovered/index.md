      ## Backstory:


      * USS Lexington (“Lady Lex”) = One of America’s first aircraft carriers

      * Battle of Coral Sea = Major WWII battle vs. Japanese in 1942

      * Americans stopped the Japanese and their advance into Australia, but
      “Lady Lex” sank.

      * 2,770 men rescued at sea, but 200+ went down with the ship.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * USS LexingtonA = FIRST American aircraft carrier to sink at war

      * Battle of Coral Sea = FIRST “air-sea” battle in history; opposing ships
      NEVER saw each other.

      * Marked a notable shift in WWII &A America’s success containing Japanese.

      * A month later, the “Battle of Midway” turns the tide of the war in
      America’s favor.

Lady Lex went down with 35 planes. So far, #RVPetrel has found 11 of them. Here”s a look at two Douglas TBD-1 Devastators, resting on top of each other, and a close up of a Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat. [http://vlcn.fyi/Tgrc30iM8xK](http://vlcn.fyi/Tgrc30iM8xK)
