      ## What To Know


      * U.S. Abortion Laws Vary By State

      * 1973: Supreme Court legalized abortion **with limits**; a woman’s right
      to an abortion is *not* absolute. Abortion is legal in first trimester,
      but states can regulate and even outlaw at certain points in pregnancy,
      *unless* there is a threat to the health/life of mother.

      * 1992: Supreme Court ruled states can’t impose an “undue burden” on the
      right of a woman to obtain an abortion.

      ## The 2020 Abortion Case


      * A 2014 Louisiana law requires abortion providers to have **admitting
      privileges** at a hospital w/in 30 miles of abortion site. It never took
      effect b/c of lawsuits.

      * The Supreme Court struck down a nearly identical Texas law in 2016,
      finding it imposed an **“undue burden.”**

      * Supporters of the law said it was meant to **protect** women.

      * Opponents of the law said it was meant to **limit access** to abortion.

      ## Why The Case Matters


      * Although the facts of the case were similar to the 2016 Texas case, this
      was the first abortion case for the Court with **Trump appointees** on the
      bench.

      * The ruling comes just months before Americans passionate about the issue
      will vote for **President** (the person who appoints Supreme Court
      justices).

      * States like Arkansas, Alabama & Indiana were waiting on the ruling
      before acting on **further laws** restricting abortion.

      > “The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe
      as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore
      Louisiana’s law cannot stand under our precedents.”


      Chief Justice John Roberts, who sided with the Court's liberal wing, on
      why he voted to block the law. Notably, he voted *in favor* of upholding
      the Texas law in 2016, but said he was bound by the legal doctrine of
      stare decisis - which requires judges to treat like cases alike, absent
      special circumstances.

      We're watching several existing challenges to state abortion laws, like
      Alabama, but none have yet reached the Supreme Court for the next term
      starting in the fall.
