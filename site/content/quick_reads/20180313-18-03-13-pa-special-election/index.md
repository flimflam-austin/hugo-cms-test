      Why is Pennsylvania’s “Special Election”  

      so “special”?


      Voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District will head to the
      polls Tuesday to vote for a new member of Congress…  

      EVEN THOUGH the district will **disappear** after November’s election.

      ## The Disappearing District


      In January, Pennsylvania’s highest court ruled the state’s congressional
      map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander favoring Republicans, and
      ordered lawmakers to draw a new map for all of the state’s 18
      congressional districts.

      All Eyes on PA-18  

      Why It Matters:


      * Pennsylvania is a **swing state**.

      * In 2016, **Trump won** PA-18 by about 20 percentage points.

      * Even though PA-18’s registered **Democrats outnumber Republicans**, only
      two Dems have held the seat in 100+ years.

      * **$15.6+ million:** Amount spent by both sides in the surprisingly close
      race.
