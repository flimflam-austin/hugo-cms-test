      # Why This Matters?


      ## Heel Designs May Change


      * In 2012, Louboutin sued a Netherlands shoe company to prevent it from
      producing red-soled shoes, citing its EU trademark.

      * Now, EU court adviser says Louboutin’s EU trademark might be invalid. A
      ruling is expected shortly.

      # Red Sole Battle In U.S.


      * In 2012, a NY federal appeals court ruled Louboutin’s U.S. trademark on
      red-soled shoes was valid, EXCEPT when the shoe itself is red too –
      meaning the trademark doesn’t apply to red monochromatic shoes (i.e.
      Dorothy’s red slippers in The Wizard of Oz).
