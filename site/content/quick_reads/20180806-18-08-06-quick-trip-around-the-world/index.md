      ## VENEZUELA: Tinder Box


      * Alleged assassination attempt on President Nicholas Maduro during
      outdoor speech Saturday.

      * Anti-Maduro group took credit for drones (that exploded), but varying
      reports from scene.

      * **Bottom Line:** Venezuela in crisis; economy collapsing & public
      pressure mounting on Maduro.

      ## IRAN: Economy Matters


      * U.S. will reportedly “snap back” sanctions on Iran from before “nuclear
      deal” early this week. Energy sector (#1 Iran export) sanctions expected
      in Nov.

      * Pres. Trump tweeted about mtg w/ Iran leadership (or not).

      * **Backdrop**: Iran economy already struggling & public discontent rising
      w/ gov’t. Often overlooked: major drought adding pressure.

      ## AFGHANISTAN: Attacks

      * Taliban & ISIS launched separate attacks over the weekend.
      * Taliban-led attack on NATO foot patrol; killed 3 Czech soldiers.
      * 1 American injured in attack (FYI: an American also killed mid-July).
      * Recent Defense Dep’t budget turns focus to China & Russia.
      * **Bottom Line**: Easy to forget, but U.S. still very much at war.

      The instability (and unpredictability) in Iran & Venezuela, 2 large oil
      producers, has led some to wonder about the impact on the global oil
      market. This could be a big story later this year. There's always a risk
      of higher costs for consumers, but could also benefit U.S. oil producers.
