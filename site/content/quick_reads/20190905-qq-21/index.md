      Text of a bill in Hawaii that calls for a phased ban on cigarettes,
      gradually raising the legal buying age to 100 years old by 2024.
      Currently, the legal buying age is 18 in most states, but it's 21 in
      Hawaii. This new bill would raise the minimum buying age to 30, hiking it
      10 years each year after, effectively prohibiting sales to all but
      centenarians in 5 years. Restrictions would not apply to ecigs, cigars or
      chewing tobacco.

      philosophy is every little bit helps.’  
        
        
        
      Brian Gorski, Coastal Conservation Assoc. exec. dir., as more than 16K
      fish are released in southwest Florida waters in an effort to recover from
      last year's red tide, Florida's worse in a decade, which killed 267 tons
      of marine life. The red tide is caused by toxins released from dead algae;
      it can be deadly to wildlife and irritate humans.
