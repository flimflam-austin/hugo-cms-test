      > “Our report of the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the United
      States illustrates several aspects of this emerging outbreak that are not
      yet fully understood, including transmission dynamics and the full
      spectrum of clinical illness.”


      Analysis by Washington State 2019-nCoV Case Investigation Team who said
      one of the challenges of COVID-19 is that it presents like other
      respiratory illnesses during flu season. They noted the similar, rapid
      evolution from no signs of pneumonia to a diagnosis in 5 days.

      any age adult. If you’re a healthy adult under 60, the signs and symptoms
      to seek care are much the same that I would say for the flu – prolonged
      high fever (104 or higher), chest pain, shortness of breath, lethargy, or
      inability to drink fluids or urinate.”

      Trevor Bedford, Bedford Labs, wrote this on March 2, 2020. The prominent
      researcher believes Patient Zero may have led to upwards of 1,500 cases in
      the Seattle area, which he expects will mimic Wuhan, China with a spike in
      illnesses. The CDC calls his work tracing the illness an "interesting
      hypothesis," but says others may have contributed to the spread.

      It reportedly took Patient Zero nearly a month to be deemed "fully
      recovered" and no one in close contact with him is known to have tested
      positive for the illness. The Seattle area remains one of the hardest hit
      in the nation.
