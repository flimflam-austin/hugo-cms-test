      > “Just as women have been undervalued in Hollywood, we aren’t adequately
      represented in the lab, or in research, when it comes to heart health.

      has failed to combat a disease that kills more of us annually than all
      forms of cancer combined.”  
        
        
        
      Barbara Streisand in a May 15th op-ed for USA Today on raising awareness

      the defendant has no grounds for complaint.”  
        
        
        
      U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, rejecting Trump's former campaign
      manager, Paul Manafort's attempt to dismiss a criminal case against him.
