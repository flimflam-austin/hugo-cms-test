      > “Just as women have been undervalued in Hollywood, we aren’t adequately
      represented in the lab, or in research, when it comes to heart health.

      has failed to combat a disease that kills more of us annually than all
      forms of cancer combined.”  
        
        
        
      Barbara Streisand in a May 15th op-ed for USA Today on raising awareness

      > “… the indictment falls squarely within that portion of the authority
      granted to the Special

      the defendant has no grounds for complaint.”  
        
        
        
      U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, rejecting Trump's former campaign
      manager, Paul Manafort's attempt to dismiss a criminal case against him.
