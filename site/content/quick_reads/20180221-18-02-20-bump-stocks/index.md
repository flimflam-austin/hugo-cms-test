      > “Just a few moments ago I signed a memorandum directing the AG to
      propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into
      machine guns. I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized,
      Jeff, very soon.”

      ## To Consider


      > ‘…it **may be easier to ban modifications that are not very popular
      among gun owners**…these **bump-stocks are not popular at all**, because
      they make guns **highly inaccurate**…’
