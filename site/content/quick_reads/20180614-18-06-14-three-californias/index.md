      ## Cali-THREE-nia? Why?


      Man behind plan is famed investor Tim Draper with a history of making good
      bets. (Heard of Skype? Tesla?)


      He says plan will “simply divide the state into smaller, more manageable
      populations.”


      He’s been working on this for years. In 2014, he tried & failed to break
      up California into 6 different states.

      > Critics argue problems would multiply with 3 new governors divvying up
      interconnected operations (water, parks, prisons).  
        
        
        
      _‘There are so many fundamentally flawed aspects to this.”_  
        
        
        
      **BUT…**A _‘In this day and age, anything can happen politically.’_

      Making it happen would require not only approval by California voters but
      Congress. Click to learn just how long it has been since the U.S. added a
      state or split one up. (Hint: It's been awhile.)
