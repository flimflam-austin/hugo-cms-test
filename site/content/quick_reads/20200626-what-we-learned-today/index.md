      ## Preexisting Conditions


      * The CDC expanded the list of preexisting conditions that make you more
      vulnerable to COVID-19, emphasizing that THESE, not _necessarily_ age
      (though the elderly are more prone to preexisting conditions) are crucial
      factors in severe cases.

      * 60% of Americans have **at least one** preexisting condition.

      * Obesity is among the most prevalent – 40% of Americans are obese.

      ## Pregnancy


      * Pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized,
      admitted to the ICU, and require a ventilator than women who are not
      pregnant.

      * However, right now, pregnant women are not at a higher risk of death.

      * Information on the lingering impacts of COVID-19 on the unborn remain
      unknown. The CDC says after 5 mos of the pandemic, they simply don’t have
      information on full-term pregnancies.

      ## Prevalence


      The CDC says research shows an estimated **10 additional cases for each
      *known* case** of COVID-19 in America,


      Consequently, the CDC estimates a small portion of the entire nation –
      **under 8%** – have been exposed to COVID-19.


      CDC Dir. Dr. Redfield says estimates for **asymptomatic spread** are btwn
      20-80%.

      Dr. Redfield says in March, about 27% or 1 in 4 deaths in America were
      attributed to a pneumonia, flu or COVID-19; now the percentage is more
      "normal," around 7%. Still he says this latest "significant increase" of
      cases is important and still part of the "first wave" of this pandemic in
      America.
