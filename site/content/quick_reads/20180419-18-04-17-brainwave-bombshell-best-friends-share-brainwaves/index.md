      # Feel like your friends can read your mind?

      They just might.

      Do You Share Brainwaves?  

      Study Says “Yes”


      > “The current results suggest that friends are **exceptionally similar**
      to one another in terms of how they perceive, interpret, and react to the
      world around them…data also demonstrate(s) that it is possible to predict
      whether or not two individuals are friends.”

      ## Small Study But Significant


      * An **entire class of grad students** (279) answered questions on
      friendships within group.

      * **42 agreed to brain scans** & watched unique videos to produce range of
      emotions.

      * Researchers charted brain activity and **could predict who were
      friends** based on results; “friendly” brains reacted similarly to images.

      > ‘I think it’s an **incredibly ingenious paper**. It suggests that
      friends resemble each other not just superficially, but in the very
      structures of their brains.’

      Perhaps THIS is why we are all SmartHER together? ‘...shared processing
      could make people click more easily and have the sort of seamless social
      interaction that can feel so rewarding.
