      Senate Reaches  

      Budget Deal ============================


      ## A look at the deal ahead of final votes:


      * Avoids shutdown…for now.

      * Raises spending on infrastructure, defense, opioid epidemic, healthcare,
      & disaster relief.

      # WHY IT MATTERS:


      * Gov’t funding runs out at midnight on Thursday (2/8).

      * Stops automatic gov’t spending cuts (aka “sequester”).

      * Raises gov’t borrowing limit until March 2019 (after this year’s midterm
      elections).

      * Deal is a rare display of bipartisanship in Congress with each side
      getting a little $omething.
