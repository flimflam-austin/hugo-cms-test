      ## Backstory


      * **2015:** Volkswagen admitted to cheating on U.S. emission tests.

      * **Fallout:** VW had to pay about $15B in fees & has until June 2019 to
      either buy back or fix 85% of its fleet, or face more fees.

      * **37 “lots”** house vehicles to be destroyed or resold (if they meet
      appropriate emissions standards).

      cars someday!
