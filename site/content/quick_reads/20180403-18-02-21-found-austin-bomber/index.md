      ## The Bomber: Unknowns


      * **We still don’t know why he did it.** Not clear he acted alone or with
      others; cops questioning his roommates.

      * Unclear if more pkg bombs exists.

      * You might read he described himself as “conservative” ~ This happened in
      community college in 2012. As of this writing, no further insight on his
      political beliefs or if that motivated him.

      anything about hate. But instead, it is the outcry of a very challenged
      young man, talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to
      this point.’
