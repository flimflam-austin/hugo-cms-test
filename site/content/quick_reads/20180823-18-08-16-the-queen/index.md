      that.”

      > “You weren’t an overnight sensation. You had to work at it and learn
      your craft: how to take care of your voice, how to pace your concerts, all
      that trial and error. I paid my dues, I certainly did.”  
        
        
        
      Franklin, the daughter of a pastor, got her start singing in church. By
      age 14, she recorded her first album and went on tour with her father's
      traveling revival show. At age 18 she went to New York, where she signed
      with Columbia Records.

      > “Everybody wants respect. In their own way, three-year-olds would like
      respect, and acknowledgment, in their terms.”  
        
        
        
      On her 1967 #1 hit & signature song "Respect." Originally recorded by Otis
      Redding, Franklin proudly acknowledged its civil & female rights roots,
      noting she had written into her performance contract that she wouldn't
      sing in front of a segregated crowd.

      > ‘I love Wal-Mart and not just because my record is there. You can get
      some things there that you cannot find at Saks or Bergdorf’s or other
      upscale stores.’  
        
        
        
      Aretha Franklin also used Walmart to workout. She told the NYPost: I walk
      the Super Walmarts, the biggest ones. If people are in the aisle and the
      store happens to be crowded that day, I go to other aisles.
