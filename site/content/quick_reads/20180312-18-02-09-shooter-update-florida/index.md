      ## Reports: Why FL Shooter Had No Criminal Record


      * Federal policy implemented in the Florida school district (and many
      others) to avoid suspending or arresting students.

      * Policy dates back to the Obama Administration.

      * Reports: Policy aimed to slow the “school-to-prison” pipeline that
      disproportionately impacts minority students.
