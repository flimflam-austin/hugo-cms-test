      ## “Twas the Night Before..”


      Today, in 1823, a newspaper published what some now call the most
      well-known poem ever written by an American.


      But who REALLY wrote it?

      > “We know not who we are indebted for the following description of that
      unwearied patron of children – that homely but delightful personification
      of parental kindness – Santa Claus…but, from whomever it may have come, we
      give thanks for it.”


      Troy Sentinel, the weekly newspaper that published, "ACCOUNT OF A VISIT
      FROM ST. NICHOLAS" on Dec. 23, 1823. At the time, the author remained a
      mystery, and in some ways, still is.

      ## Clement Moore


      * Born into a prominent New York family.

      * Reportedly penned the poem on Christmas Eve in 1822, while on the way
      home to see his 6 children.

      * **Clue:** Said to have a Dutch sleigh driver the night he composed the
      poem.

      * A professor & scholar, some suggest he was embarrassed by the playful
      poem, which is why he stayed anonymous.

      * Published poem under his own name in 1844 – 20 years after first
      published.

      ## Henry Livingston, Jr.


      * Prominent Dutch farmer in upstate New York, served in Revolutionary War.

      * His family (children), and others, say they heard him recite the poem
      YEARS before it was published.

      * **Clue:** Original reindeer names “Dunder & Blixem” translate to
      “Thunder” & “Lightening” in Dutch. Later edits changed to German “Donder &
      Blixen.”

      * Never took credit for the poem; Died 5 yrs after the poem was first
      published.

      ## Why It Matters


      **_“Though legend has it that Santa Claus hails from the North Pole, he
      was actually a New Yorker…”_**


      The poem’s author solidified the image of Santa and his reindeer for the
      newly formed United States (& beyond), and has continued to do so for the
      last *nearly* 200 years.

      How did the paper get the poem? Another mystery. The paper wrote on that
      day: "We hope our little patrons, both lads and lasses, will accept it as
      proof of our unfeigned good will toward them—as a token of our warmest
      wish that they may have many a merry Christmas."
