      ## Why Tariffs Now?


      * Commerce Dep’t warns cheap imports of steel & aluminum hurt nat’l
      security – i.e., not enough U.S. companies can competitively produce metal
      for our military.

      * Pres. Trump campaigned on boosting jobs & growth in what he labeled a
      bedrock American industry (important in key states like Pennsylvania).

      # Why Tariffs Matter:


      Could Cost You $$  

      While Also Creating Jobs


      * Positive for American companies that produce these products.

      * Some fear retaliation from China & others – a possible “trade war” could
      mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on MANY products.

      * Stock market reacted by falling sharply (down 586 pts at low).

      ## From Those Who Would Benefit From Tariffs:


      > ‘We are not protectionist. We want a level playing field.’

      > ‘The President is proposing a massive tax increase on American families.
      Protectionism is weak, not strong.”  
        
        
        
      Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), March 1, 2018, who is concerned about rising prices
      for American families & industries, such as farming that use heavy
      equipment made from material like steel.

      # Tariff Deja Vu?


      * In 2002, Pres. Bush imposed aA **30% tariff** on steel imports.

      * **Lasted only 20 months** after Europe responded with its own tariffs.

      * World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled U.S. violated international trade
      agreements.

      * **Difference this time**: Pres. Trump cites nat’l security provision
      that WTO typically doesn’t probe.

      Don't forget timing. Trump announced his campaign manager for 2020 this
      week (Pennsylvania crucial to his 2016 win) AND sanctions on North Korea,
      preventing shipments to China (a major metal producer).
