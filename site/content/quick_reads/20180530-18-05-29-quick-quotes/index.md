      > “I think it’s safe to say authorities have been concerned about the flow
      of lava onto the plant property since the eruption started.”  
        
        
        
      David Mace, FEMA spokesman as lava from Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano covered
      one of the wells at the island's geothermal power plant, prompting fears
      of a toxic gas leak. Authorities urge residents to evacuate the area due
      to fast-moving flows.
