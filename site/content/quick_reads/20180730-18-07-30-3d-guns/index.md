      # Digital DIY Gunmaking


      > Starting **August 1st**, a blueprint for how to build the first fully
      3D-printed gun (and others) can legally appear online.  
        
        
        
      Why some worry about a **new threat to pubic safety**, while others say
      this is a **non-issue**.

      ## What’s the Backstory?


      * In 2015, Cody WilsonA sued after gov’t ordered him to remove online
      blueprints for “The Liberator,” the world’s first fully 3D-printable gun.

      * Gov’t said blueprints violated export laws, a nat’l security threat.

      * Wilson argued his 1st & 2nd amendment rights (free speech & bear arms)
      were violated & won.

      * Settlement reached in June.

      ## What This Means:


      * Legal settlement allows Wilson to post his blueprints online; blueprints
      instruct how to print parts to build the gun.

      * Blueprints includeA **single-shot pistol**A toA **AR-15
      semiautomatic.A**

      * 3D-printed guns**A untraceable**A (no system in place to assign serial
      numbers to 3D-printed firearms)A & therefore, owner **not subject to
      background checks.**

      ## What is the TRUE threat?


      * **No known crimes committed by 3D-printed guns** & questionable
      efficiency; some say 3D-printed guns will explode in user’s face after one
      shot. Critics argue technology will get better & less expensive

      * **COST:**A 3D Printers cost**A $5K – $600K.**A A standard gun costs
      **only a few**A **hundred of dollars**.

      What's next? Philadelphia was the 1st city to ban 3D gun printing now
      others are rushing to follow suit. Gun control advocates attempted to
      block the blueprints from being released, but did not succeed. Read more

_There are some ideas for containing the risk. One measure—which passed in California and took effect there this month—would require anyone who makes a gun at home to register it and apply for a state-issued serial number. The Californian law also bans the sale or trade of homemade guns. But enacting a law and enforcing it are separate matters. Arrests for non-compliance are likely only after an untraceable gun is used to commit a crime. And with some 300m firearms in America, skirting the rules to acquire a gun is not difficult, regardless of how it was made. As one gun-control expert put it, It”s a hell of regulatory challenge._
