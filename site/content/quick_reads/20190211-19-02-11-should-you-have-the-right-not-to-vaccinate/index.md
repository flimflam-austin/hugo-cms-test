      ## The Great Vaccine Debate


      **Should you have the right to *not* vaccinate your child?**


      A measles outbreak prompts lawmakers to consider reversing course on
      policies they may have helped put in place.

      ## What’s Going On:


      * Measles cases in 10 states, some tied to low vaccination rates.

      * 46 states: allow religious exemptions to vaccinations.

      * 17 states: allow for “philosophical” exemptions for personal beliefs.

      * In the wake of recent outbreaks, Washington & Oregon are looking to
      potentially tighten laws that allow for these personal exemptions.

      > ‘I’m very worried that these measles epidemics are becoming a new
      normal…The enablers are state legislators in those states, that have
      allowed themselves to be played.”  
        
      Dr. Peter Hotez, Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development

      decisions for my kids.’  
        
      Becky Johnson mother of 3, who is against vaccinations. She disagrees with
      a new California law passed in 2015 (after a measles outbreak at
      Disneyland) that reversed personal exemptions, requiring vaccinations.

      ## Who Decides Who Vaccinates & Where?


      * Federal gov’t makes **recommendations, not laws or policies,A** re:
      vaccines.

      * Your state gov’t sets requirements for vaccinations at a local level,
      normally for attending school.

      * **Why?** Simply – the federal gov’t is responsible for our national
      security and your state, for your personal safety.

      Current measles vaccination rate in America is approx. 90%; Some states
      have lower. In general, a community needs to have 90-95% vaccination rates
      for "herd immunity" that prevents the spread of a contagious disease.
