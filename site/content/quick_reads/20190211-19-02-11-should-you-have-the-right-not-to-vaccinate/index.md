      ## The Great Vaccine Debate


      **Should you have the right to *not* vaccinate your child?**


      A measles outbreak prompts lawmakers to consider reversing course on
      policies they may have helped put in place.

      ## What’s Going On:


      * Measles cases in 10 states, some tied to low vaccination rates.

      * 46 states: allow religious exemptions to vaccinations.

      * 17 states: allow for “philosophical” exemptions for personal beliefs.

      * In the wake of recent outbreaks, Washington & Oregon are looking to
      potentially tighten laws that allow for these personal exemptions.

      > ‘I’m very worried that these measles epidemics are becoming a new
      normal…The enablers are state legislators in those states, that have
      allowed themselves to be played.”

      Disneyland) that reversed personal exemptions, requiring vaccinations.

      ## Who Decides Who Vaccinates & Where?


      * Federal gov’t makes **recommendations, not laws or policies,A** re:
      vaccines.

      * Your state gov’t sets requirements for vaccinations at a local level,
      normally for attending school.

      * **Why?** Simply – the federal gov’t is responsible for our national
      security and your state, for your personal safety.

      Current measles vaccination rate in America is approx. 90%; Some states
      have lower. In general, a community needs to have 90-95% vaccination rates
      for "herd immunity" that prevents the spread of a contagious disease.
