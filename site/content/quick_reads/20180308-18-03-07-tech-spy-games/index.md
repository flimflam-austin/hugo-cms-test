      ## High-stakes battle over bringing you faster internet


      The US government is looking into the “possible” $117B takeover of US
      chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore’s Broadcom.


      What’s at stake? Potentially your internet access and the safety of our
      entire telecommunications system.

      Why Such Drama?


      * Qualcomm = crown jewel of the United States tech industry.

      * Its chips are used in most mobile phones, and its semiconductors will be
      used in the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks known as 5G.

      * Whoever buys it, buys its competitive advantage AND literally a way “in”
      to our electronics.

      ## “National Security Threat”


      * Trump AdministrationA warns of Broadcom’s foreign ties and risks of
      possible gov’t spying.

      * U.S. Govt intervention is unusual because the deal is not finalized.

      * If deal is de-railed by U.S., Broadcom has no option to appeal,
      according to CNBC.




      WHY IT MATTERS

      ## The U.S. Govt Fears…


      *If* Broadcom takes over a major U.S. company (Qualcomm), leadership will
      prioritize short-term profits & cut back on research, causing America to
      lose its competitive advantage, especially in 5G (5G = 5th generation
      ultra-fast wireless connections) and allow Chinese competitors to gain
      ground.

      ## Why Broadcom Says Critics Are Wrong

      * Promises to maintain 5G investment levels
      * Plans to move its company HQ to U.S.A by May 6.
      * 25K Broadcom employees will be here in the US = American jobs.
      * Creating a $1.5B investment fund to train American engineers
