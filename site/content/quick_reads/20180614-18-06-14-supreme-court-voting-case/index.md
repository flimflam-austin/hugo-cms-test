      ## Background


      * Ohio procedure allows the state to remove voters **from the registry**
      who **haven’t voted for 2 years** & **fail to respond to mailed notices**
      confirming they are still eligible to vote **w/in four years**.

      * SCOTUS ruled against a challenge to this policy.

      * Ruling directly impacts **6 other states w/similar policies**A (GA, MT
      OK, OR, PA & WV).

      ## Why It Matters


      **Federal law prohibits states from removing voters from registration
      solely because of their failure to vote.**


      The Supreme Court said Ohio’s procedure does NOT violate the law because
      “it removes registrants only when they have failed to vote **and have
      failed to respond to a change-of-residence notice**.”

      ## HE Said / HE Said


      DNC Chair Tom Perez called the ruling “**an attack on democracy**” and a
      “**power grab by a Republican Party that wants to make it harder for
      people to vote**.”


      Ohio’s Republican Sec. of State Jon Husted called it ‘**a victory for
      electoral integrity**.’ Husted is running for lieutenant governor in
      November.

      Remember: Ohio is a swing state; it can swing republican or democrat in
      state/national elections. That's part of the reason why this case has
      heightened attention, as the voting rolls are HIGHLY important for both
      parties.
