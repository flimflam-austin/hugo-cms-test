      ## USPS


      United States Postal Service


      Unofficial creed: _“Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night
      stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed
      rounds.”_


      “The Postal Service receives NO tax dollars for operating expenses and
      relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its
      operations.” (USPS)

      ## Important Background


      * The USPS is a **financial mess.**

      * Why? Less business & huge liabilities (debt, pensions, etc.). **It lost
      $78B from 2007-2019.**

      * **Your state determines how you vote.** The federal government **DOES
      NOT administer elections – state election boards do.** The federal gov’t
      has oversight over the USPS which assists delivery of absentee & mail-in
      ballots on a state level.

      ## A 2020 Warning


      * **Mail-in ballots and delays surged during COVID-19 elections**; Two of
      NY’s June congressional races took 6 weeks for final count.

      * Some state election boards are trying to make mail-in ballots more
      accessible in part to enable voters to avoid crowds.

      * In July, USPS warned 40+ state election offices to plan for potential
      delays and recommended they send ballots to voters as early as possible.

      ## Whats Happening Now?


      * The House of Representatives, led by Democrats, **carved out $25B for
      USPS** as part of an emergency economic stimulus bill to cushion the blow
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, **PLUS $3.6B to states to help manage the
      election.**

      * Pres. Trump calls this funding a “bailout” – an unnecessary add-on.
      Pres. alleges Democrats want to increase mail-in voting in order to tilt
      the election against him and risk voter fraud.

      ## And then there’s this…


      * A new Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, took over in June.

      * DeJoy is a businessman and Republican donor who has promised to help
      USPS cut costs and shore-up finances.

      * Democrats accuse him of purposefully cutting resources right when the
      nation needs it most, and asked the FBI to investigate. He denies any
      wrongdoing and postponed any changes until after the election.

      > “Nice try, Postmaster General DeJoy, but the House will still be passing
      our bill to ensure the delivery of the mail through the election. We will
      deliver for America by voting on Saturday. #DontMessWithUSPS”


      House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) called her colleagues back to D.C. (they were
      expected to be in their districts until September) to vote on a bill
      prohibiting any proposed changes to USPS's operations and service
      standards until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.

      > “…(Democrats) want to send in millions and millions of ballots…They’re
      being lost, they’re being discarded. They’re finding them in piles. It’s
      going to be a catastrophe. So — and this is beyond the Post Office.”


      Pres. Trump alleging Democrats want funding for Post Office to increase
      mail-in voting that will favor them. The President's critics accuse him of
      voter suppression for his unwillingness to give additional money to the
      USPS.

      unions calls the potential challenge of extra votes a "piece of cake" with
      proper planning. The fate of the bill remains TBD. A previous COVID-19
      economic stimulus bill granted a $10B loan to the USPS. The USPS has
      repeatedly borrowed from the Treasury in recent years.
