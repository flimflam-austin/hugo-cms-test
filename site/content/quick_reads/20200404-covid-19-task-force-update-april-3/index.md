      “You can do it – you don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it.”


      Pres. Trump on new guidance for Americans to wear cloth (NOT medical
      grade) masks. The Surgeon General said new evidence shows a "significant
      portion" of people with the new coronavirus may have no symptoms but can
      still spread the virus. The CDC updated its recommendation Friday
      "advising "wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other
      social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores
      and pharmacies)."

      > “This virus has a great weakness. It can’t jump from one person to
      another if it has to swim more than 6 feet.”


      CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield explained wearing "a face barrier can
      interrupt the number of virus particles that go from one person to
      another." However, he said social distancing remains a priority: "We have
      a power tool - a powerful weapon, that is social distancing."

      > “When we get through this we can go back and look at what happened,
      where… When you’re in the middle of it, you have to concentrate on serving
      the needs of each American.”


      Dr. Deboah Birx addressing critics. She emphasized the need for an
      effective test to indicate who has been exposed to the new coronavirus,
      and who hasn't. Dr. Birx noted there are 150+ countries working
      collectively to fight COVID-19 and it's "devastating" for all.

      > “Now we’ll make sure that any American, even those that have no
      insurance, will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have
      to worry about the bill.”


      VP Mike Pence. HHS Secretary Alex Azar added providers who care for the
      uninsured will be compensated at the medicare reimbursement rates and
      cannot bill the uninsured for COVID-19 treatment. He also reiterated that
      those now unemployed (losing employer healthcare) may apply for health
      insurance via ACA health exchanges.
