      # Lady Liberty Arrives


      ## June 19, 1885




      The Statue of Liberty arrives in New York Harbor. Although 12M+ immigrants
      passed under her gaze, she was delivered (and constructed) years before
      Ellis Island opened.

      ## How Did Liberty Arrive?


      * **350** separate pieces; **214** crates.

      * **A decade late**. France wanted to gift “Liberty Enlightening the
      World” for the centennial of the Declaration of Independence (1776). Lack
      of funds held back production.

      * Eventually both USA/FR raised enough $$ through charity, lottery, &
      donation to bring “Lady Liberty” to life.

      ## Liberty & Immigration


      * Statue of Liberty fully constructed in **1886**; immigration wasn’t sole
      focus of statue, but celebration of American democracy overall.

      * Ellis Island Immigration Station opened in **1892**.

      * Famous Lazarus poem “_Give me your tired, your poor_” written in
      **1883** to raise funds for the statue**;** engraved on base 20 years
      later in **1903**.

**SmartHER FYI:** We’ve seen the date of the arrival of the Statue of Liberty also attributed to June 17, 1885. We are following the history according to the Library of Congress, though some sites, including the official site of the Statue of Liberty, leaves the exact date vague and says generically, June 1885.

The New Colossus

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,  
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;  
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand  
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame  
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name  
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand  
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command  
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she  
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,  
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,  
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,  
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
