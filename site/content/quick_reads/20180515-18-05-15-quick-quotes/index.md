      act on its own.’**  
        
        
        
      Justice Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court's 6-3 vote to allow sports

      > “Whether I’m running around southern Wisconsin or America, nobody is
      talking about Stormy Daniels. Nobody is talking about Russia. They’re

      communities, they’re talking about jobs, they’re talking about the
      economy, they’re talking about national security.”
