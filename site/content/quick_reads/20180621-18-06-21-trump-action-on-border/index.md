      ## What We Know:


      * Trump’s exec order will notA **change ‘zero tolerance’** **policy** –
      govt will charge all who cross the border illegally.

      * However, itA **ends separations** byA keeping families together in
      detention centers, run with the help of **Dept of Defense**.

      * It does leave roomA to separate children from family, but only if it’s
      in the child’s best interests.

      ## Past As Precedent?


      > “A federal judge, Dolly M. Gee, scuttled the Obama team’s efforts to
      jail families together in 2015 when she ruled that doing so violated the
      agreement and said migrant children couldn’t be held more than 20 days.”  
        
        
        
      WSJ. Trump admin will face same legal issue as Obama admin, and same
      judge. Children held now an ave of 40-50 days before placed w/sponsor
      family..

      The President's Executive Order doesn’t change the status of children
      already separated. That’s TBD.
