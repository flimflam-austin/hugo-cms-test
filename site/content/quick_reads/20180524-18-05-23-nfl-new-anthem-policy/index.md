      ## NFL: Players Must Stand


      Days ahead of Memorial Day, NFL announces new policy on national anthem.
      Turns out the ***new*** policy isn’t really ***new***A at all.

      ## Important Context:


      * NFL players didn’t always come on the field for the national anthem –
      **only since 2009.**

      * “New policy” allows players to choose to yet again NOT go on the field
      for the national anthem.

      * *If* on the field, players must **“stand and show respect”** during the
      anthem or **face a league fine & possibly a fine from the team.**

      ## Why Now?


      **NFL:**A “It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false
      perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This
      is not and was never the case.”  

      **Something To Consider**: Americans are watching less TV overall & NFL
      viewership has declined by millions since 2015. Some viewers say they
      boycotted the NFL because of the players on-field protests.

      > “This is fear of a diminished bottom line. It’s also fear of a president
      turning his base against a corporation. This is not patriotism. Don’t get
      it confused.”

      policy" via Twitter. Long supports players on-field protests and is an
      outspoken critic of President Trump.

      Different sports have different policies for player etiquette during the
      national anthem. The NBA has a strict one - and Nascar - none at all.

Despite the NFL”s approval of a revised policy thatA requires players on the field to stand during the national anthem, Jets chairman Christopher Johnson told Newsday on Wednesday that his players are free to take a knee or perform some other protest without fear of repercussion from the team.League owners unanimously adopted a policy that allows players who don”t want to participate in the anthem to remain in the locker room. Players who do appear on the field for the anthem must stand; if they don”t, their respective club faces a league-issued fine and teams can levy additional fines.I do not like imposing any club-specific rules, Johnson said. If somebody [on the Jets] takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players. I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer that they stand? Of course. But I understand if they felt the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we”re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I don”t want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I won”t. There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, that”s just something I”ll have to bear.
