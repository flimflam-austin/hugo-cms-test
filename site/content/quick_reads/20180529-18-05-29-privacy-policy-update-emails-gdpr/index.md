      ## EU Privacy Protections


      Last week, a new law, the **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR),
      went into effect in the EU.


      It requires every company that sells goods or services to EU residents to
      UPDATE their privacy polices *and* clearly describe (in plain English) how
      they COLLECT & USE personal data, like your name, age, location, gender,
      birthday, or marital status.

      ## Under the GDPR, companies MUST:


      * Explain **HOW & WHY** they collect users’ personal data.

      * Obtain users’ **CONSENT** before using their data for $ purposes.

      * **ALLOW** users to access the data collected about them, correct it (if
      needed) & download it.

      * **ERASE** users’ data (upon request) if it is not being used for a
      compelling business purpose.

      ## You don’t live in the EU, so why are you getting the privacy updates?


      The GDPR applies globally to all companies that collect data from EU
      residents **regardless of whether they are located** in Silicon Valley or
      across the Atlantic Ocean.


      Those that fail to comply risk a fine of up to 4% of their annual revenue
      or 20M euros (**whichever is higher**).

      The GDPR aims to improve privacy protections, but some experts are
      skeptical, noting that most people won't even read (yet alone understand)
      the updated privacy notices providing them more control over their
      personal data. Read more about the GDPR here:
