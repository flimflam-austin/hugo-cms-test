      ## Why Does This Matter?


      * Father Benoka use to live and work in Mosul and survived the ISIS
      invasion. He says Christians *still* face the **threat of genocide**.

      * The **Shiite Muslim** majority govt in Iraq & Iran’s Shiite regime work
      together through “Shiite Militias”.

      * Benoka says he believes the goal of these Shiite Militias inside Iraq is
      to **push out minorities and claim land for Iran**.

      This unique perspective comes from an area few journalists venture. As
      focus remains on the "Iran Deal" overall, we want to share the experience
      of someone on the ground in the Middle East. It's one story - We look
      forward to telling more.
