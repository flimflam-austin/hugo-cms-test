      ## Boeing Hit By WannaCry Virus, Urges Calm


      > “The vulnerability was limited to a few machines. We deployed software
      patches. There was no interruption to the 777 jet program or any of our
      programs.”

      * **Exploits flaw** in outdated versions of Windows to gain access.

      * **Infects one computer & spreads** to entire network.

      * Microsoft released a patch after attacks in 70+ countries in mid-2017,
      but **unpatched systems remain vulnerable.**

      Are Boeing’s Planes  

      At Risk?


      > “I don’t think that’s realistic. I don’t think any of Boeing’s planes or
      any aircraft anywhere run Embedded Windows.”

* Seattle Times: Boeing hit by WannaCry virus, but says attack caused little damage: [https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-hit-by-wannacry-virus-fears-it-could-cripple-some-jet-production/](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-hit-by-wannacry-virus-fears-it-could-cripple-some-jet-production/)
* Is WannaCry Back?  
Ransomware is malicious software that can lock up your files until you send hackers a ransom payment. It was featured in the WannaCry attacks in May and the NotPetya attacks in June, both of which swept through hospitals, banks and governments in several countries. But after July, the rates of ransomware infections dropped sharply, according to a report from Malwarebytes in January.

* Boeing Possibly Hit by “WannaCry” Malware Attack  
_WannaCry was first developed at the National Security Agency and later dumped online in 2016 by mysterious hackers called the Shadow Brokers._  
_That tool, which the N.S.A. code-named Eternal Blue, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software that allowed attackers to spread their malware automatically through vulnerable machines. In other cases, ransomware attackers had to manually encrypt victim”s systems.__By incorporating the N.S.A.”s tool into their ransomware last May, hackers ensured their attack would encrypt as many vulnerable machines as possible, causing maximum disruption. White House officials said North Korea was directly responsible for the attack._
