      Clever or Creepy?


      > From free donuts to bonus pay, some companies offer incentives for you
      to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  
        
        
      Smart policy or strange times?  

      (or a little bit of both)

      “Krispy Kreme is finding ways to be sweet as the U.S. continues to scale
      COVID-19 vaccinations.”


      Krispy Kreme's latest incentive includes one free glazed doughnut to those
      who show their COVID-19 vaccination records. Those who qualify can receive
      one doughnut a day, no purchase necessary. Food for thought: the CDC says
      weight is a factor for incidence of severity with COVID-19; obesity may
      put people at triple the risk of hospitalization.

      encourage vaccination…”


      The National Law Review writes that private businesses *can* legally
      require vaccinations (with exceptions for those who decline) – and advises
      incentives need exceptions, too. For example, Krispy Kreme is offering a
      free coffee and doughnut for anyone on Mondays during this campaign, even
      without a vaccination record.

      BIG PICTURE


      * **Incentives for customers w/proof of the COVID-19 vaccine are rare *so
      far***: Krispy Kreme is the first major U.S. brand to offer something *to
      customers* on a national level.

      * **Incentives for employees to receive the vaccine are on the rise**:
      often in the form of bonus pay for stores like Kroger, Trader Joe’s, &
      Dollar General. Target’s includes bonus pay and $ for a ride to and from
      the vaccination site.

      Businesses are offering everything from gift cards, to discounts on
      purchases, and even "joints for jabs" - yes, you read that correctly:
      pre-rolled marijuana joints for those with proof of vaccination. Instead
      of quoting from the experts, we wanted to toss this question to YOU: Will
      these incentives be effective? What do you think of them?
