      ## And Why Are Some Calls in Chinese Anyway?A


      > 


      * Chinese-language spam calls are targeting immigrants, pretending to be
      from the Chinese consulate.

      * Don’t speak Chinese? Robocallers don’t care. It costs them virtually
      nothing; they just need to reach one Chinese-speaking person.

      * NYPD estimates $3M has been stolen from this roboscam.

      The law can't catch up with tech, but prosecutions are up. In May, the FCC
      slapped a $120M fine on a man who made nearly 100M robocalls from 2015 -
      2016. FCC said it was "one of the largest - and most dangerous - illegal
      robocalling campaigns" ever.
