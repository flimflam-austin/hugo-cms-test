      ## What It Is:


      * A two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

      * Developed using messenger RNA technology (mRNA); gives the body a
      genetic blueprint to build a viral protein in order to teach the body what
      to later identify and protect against.

      * Commonly called “the Pfizer vaccine,” though development started in
      early January by the founders of a German company, BioNTech, who feared
      COVID-19 would spread worldwide.

    body: "## Does It Work?\n\nBased on analysis released by the FDA:\n\n* Early data\_suggests benefits after first dose and 95% efficacy of preventing COVID-19 after two doses.\n* “…suggested benefit of the vaccine in **preventing severe COVID-19**, in **preventing COVID-19 following the first dose**, and in **preventing COVID-19 in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection**…”"

      ## Who Was Tested:


      * 44,000 participants overall.

      * Ages range from 12 to 75 yrs old & up.

      * Participants during Stage 1 _“excluded participants at high risk of
      SARS-CoV-2 infections.”_

      * Phase 2/3 expanded to those higher risk, with preexisting conditions
      such as obesity and diabetes.

      * Phase 2/3 ratio of men:women was nearly even. Most participants (82%)
      were white. Median age: 51.

      ## Safety


      > “….no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance
      of an EUA.”  
        
      Data was gleaned from approx. 38,000 participants 16 years & older over a
      median follow-up duration of two months after their second dose.

      * muscle pain (38.3%);

      * chills (31.9%);

      * joint pain (23.6%);

      ## PREGNANCY


      “Pregnancy outcomes are otherwise unknown at this time.”


      * Women were given pregnancy tests before participating in trial and
      excluded if pregnant.

      * 23 pregnancies occurred during trial (12 in women who received the
      vaccine, 11 in placebo group) and the study will be “collecting outcomes”
      of these pregnancies.

      The mRNA technology used to create this vaccine has never been approved
      for use against infectious diseases or licensed in the United States --
      for emergency use authorization (EUA) or otherwise. An advisory panel will
      recommend whether or not to grant EUA to this vaccine on Thursday Dec. 10.
