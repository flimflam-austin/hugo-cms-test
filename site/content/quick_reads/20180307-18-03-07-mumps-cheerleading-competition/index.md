      # What are ‘Mumps’?


      * Tell-tale signs: ‘puffy cheeks & swollen jaw’ (CDC)

      * Other symptoms: fever, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite.

      * Symptoms can appear in 25 day period & can last several weeks.

      * Most Americans receive MMR vaccine – Measles, Mumps and Rubella – as
      infants. It’s 88% effective, not 100%, so cases can occasionally surface.

      > “Mumps outbreaks can occur **any time of year**. A major factor
      contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as
      attending the same class, **playing on the same sports team**, or living
      in a dormitory with a person who has mumps.”
