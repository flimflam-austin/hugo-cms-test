      the 11th federal execution after a 17-yr pause.

      > “The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the
      victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our
      justice system.”


      Former Attorney General William Barr in 2019 announcing the resumption of
      federal executions after an informal 17-year moratorium; the federal gov't
      adopted a new lethal injection protocol after years of legal challenges.
      In recent years, bipartisan support has backed the elimination of the
      death penalty.

      ## Death Penalty: Modern Era


      * **1961:** Last time U.S. military executed a military service member
      (several former soldiers remain on death row).

      * **1976:** States resumed carrying out the death penalty after the U.S.
      Supreme Court reinstated it, revising a 1972 ruling that it violates the
      8th Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

      * **2020:** Federal government resumed carrying out the death penalty for
      the first time since 2003.

      ## Death Penalty:  

      Arguments On Both Sides


      **FOR:** Some proponents say justice demands the death penalty for
      particularly abhorrent crimes committed by criminals incapable of
      rehabilitation.


      **AGAINST:** Others say the death penalty is inhumane, inconsistently
      applied (citing economic & racial disparities) and that it does not deter
      crime.

      The federal government carried out ten executions during the last six
      months of 2020. Three more federal death row inmates are scheduled to be
      put to death before the end of Pres. Trump's term this month, including
      what will be the first federal execution of a woman on January 12, the
      first since 1953 (nearly 70 years ago).
