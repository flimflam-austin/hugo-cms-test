      # Let’s Set The Stage:


      * China = Largest exporter in the world.

      * America = China’s largest customer.

      * We have a trade deficit (we take in more goods than we export); ChinaA
      has a positive tradeA balance (they export more goods than they import).

      # Why Tax On China?


      ## WH Wants Change – Says:


      * China cheats & steals from U.S – treats U.S. companies badly.

      * China targets American intellectual property through hacking and unfair
      business practices.

      * China’s trade policies threaten U.S. national security (for all of the
      above).

      ## What Does It Mean For You?


      * You may pay more – not just for imported Chinese goods but U.S. goods if
      China retaliates with a tax of it’s own.

      * Reminder: We are China’s #1 customer.A Some argue we **should** leverage
      our standing. After all,A isn’t the customer always right? But others say
      this is dangerous.

      ## New White House Advisor


      Pres. Trump named Amb. John Bolton as his new National Security Advisor
      (in April).A What Bolton says about U.S./China relations:  

      _“I just don’t understand why being a punching bag is the right response.
      I think if you get the attention of some of these violators you might move
      towards real free trade.”_

      ## Perspective


      > ‘We don’t know how this is going to turn out. It could be resolved in a
      few months, or it could spiral out of control into a broader strategic
      rivalry.”

* The White House”s actions did win praise from some Democrats who rarely line up with the president. I don”t agree with President Trump on a whole lot, but today I want to give him a big pat on the back, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).
