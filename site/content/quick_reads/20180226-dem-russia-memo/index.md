      ## Democrat Memo


      * 10-page redacted & unclassified.

      * Written in January, but Republican majority on House Intel Committee
      blocked its release.

      * Memo released on Saturday while the Committee’s Chair (a Republican)
      spoke at a gathering of conservatives.

      * **In-Focus:** Carter Page, an American who worked for Trump campaign at
      one time.

      ## Democrats Claim:


      * In late July 2016, the FBI started its investigation into Carter Page,
      but didn’t receive the infamous “dossier” (a research document created by
      an anti-Trump firm hired by democrats) until more than 6 weeks later.

      * This goes against GOP allegations FBI officials relied on slanted
      political material (dossier) to justify surveillance of Page.

      > “DOJ and the FBI would have been remiss in their duty to protect the
      country had they not sought…to conduct temporary surveillance of Carter
      Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian
      government.”

      political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that
      were done. SO ILLEGAL!”

      # Why This Matters:


      * U.S. government cannot spy on citizens without a warrant.

      * Republicans say Dept of Justice (DOJ) used biased political material to
      justify the warrant.

      * Democrats say DOJ only used political material AFTER other reasons
      justified the warrant.

      * Either way, political material mentioned in a case to spy on an
      American. **Slippery Slope.A**
