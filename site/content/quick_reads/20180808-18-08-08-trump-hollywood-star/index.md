      ## Behind the Scenes


      * Pres. Trump’s star is a site of increasing vandalism & protest.

      * West Hollywood Mayor said the Council’s resolution urging the star’s
      removal isn’t political, telling CNN:A _“Earning a star … is an honor.
      When one belittles & attacks minorities, immigrants, Muslims, people with
      disabilities or women — the honor no longer exists.”_
