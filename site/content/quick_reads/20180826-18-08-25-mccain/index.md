      to go one way or the other. Either it was easier for them to break you the
      next time, or it was harder. In other words, if you are going to make it,
      you get tougher as time goes by.’_

      The former P.O.W. & 6-term AZ Senator (R) has stopped treatment for an
      aggressive brain cancer. In his 30+ years in Congress, he earned a
      reputation as a political maverick voting his beliefs over politics. The
      former presidential nominee will turn 82 next week.

_John McCain spent 5A1/2 years in captivity as a POW in North Vietnam. His first-person account of that harrowing ordeal was published in U.S. News & World Report on in May 14, 1973. Shot down in his Skyhawk dive bomber on Oct. 26, 1967, Navy flier McCain was taken prisoner with fractures in his right leg and both arms. He received minimal care and was kept in wretched conditions that he describes vividly in this U.S. News special report._
