      ## What’s to Blame


      * **Inflation = increase in prices, drop in purchasingA value of money**
      (i.e. thingsA cost more).

      * Fed’s goal: keep economy expanding, but not so fast that it drives up
      inflation.

      * A decade after the recession, Fed has made progress. May unemployment
      rate was 3.8%, lowest since 2000, while inflation was just below Fed’s 2%
      target.

      increases expected this year. Click for one opinion on why the Fed should
