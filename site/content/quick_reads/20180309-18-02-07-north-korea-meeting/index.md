      ## From The President


      _“Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean
      Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North
      Korea during this period of time. **Great progress being made but
      sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being
      planned!”**_

    body: "## Something To Consider:\n\n_“PS: To be clear — we need to talk to North Korea. But Kim is not inviting Trump so that he can surrender North Korea’s weapons. Kim is inviting Trump to demonstrate that his investment in nuclear and missile capabilities has forced the United States to treat him as an equal.”_  \nJeffrey Lewisa\x0F, Twitter, @ArmsControlWonk Mar. 8, 2018"

      Word to the Wise: Talk is one thing. Action another. Watch ACTION by
      either side instead of rhetoric. Pres. Trump talked about North Korea in
      State of The Union - We included a portion of the speech on the source
      page.

_But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea._

**_North Korea”s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland._**

_We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening._

_Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.A I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position._

_We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies._

_Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.A On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.A At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.A After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15A years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June — horribly injured and on the verge of death.A He passed away just days after his return._

_Otto”s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight — along with Otto”s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.A You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.A Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto”s memory with American resolve._

_Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.A His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho._

_In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.A One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.A In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.A He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.A He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.A His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves — permanently stunting their own growth.A Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.A His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.A He had — and he resolved to be free._

_Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.A Most of his family followed.A His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death._

_Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most a\u0011- the truth._
