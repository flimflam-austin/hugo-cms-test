      “sources.”

      ## Meanwhile…Back On Earth


      * Existing Home Sales in U.S. for January = disappointment.

      * Biggest year-over-year decline in 3 years.

      * Existing home sales (homes already built) account for nearly 90% of the
      market.

      * Low inventory leading to higher prices & slower sales.

      ## Why It Matters


      * Real estate market impacts overall economy; local & national.

      * Moving, furnishing, decorating, replacing appliances, renovations etc.
      impact many industries.

      * Recent data is a snapshot of **one** month, but this is why we pay
      attention – to see if slowing sales becomes a “trend.”

      costs affecting how much the buyer can afford & this could put a damper on
      existing home sales & take some of the wind out of the economy’s sails.”
