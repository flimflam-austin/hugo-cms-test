      > “The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our
      interests, or our allies.”


      Sec. of Defense Mark Esper on an airstrike targeting five weapons storage
      facilities the U.S. says belong to the militia that attacked U.S. and
      coalition forces Wednesday. Sec. Esper says the same Iranian-backed group
      is responsible for a series of other attacks.

      ## Important Context


      * Despite the U.S. targeting and killing an Iranian military leader after
      the death of an American contractor in December by an Iranian-backed
      militia, a similar attack targeted Americans Wednesday.

      * Despite the U.S. declaring the “defeat” of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the
      group reportedly is attempting to regroup in Northern Iraq.

      * Bottom Line: The threats from both ISIS and Iran continue; tensions
      simmer.

      A message from the Defense Dept after the airstrikes Friday morning in
      Iraq: "These terror groups must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition
      forces or face consequences at a time and place of our choosing."
      Meanwhile, Iran confronts one of the deadliest outbreaks of COVID-19 on
      the planet.
