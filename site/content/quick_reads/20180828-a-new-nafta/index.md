      # TRADING UP?

      America & Mexico agree *in theory* to a new trade deal.  
      Will Canada come a long for the ride?  
      (and why it may impact the cost of your next car).

      A *new* NAFTA?

      ## NAFTA 101


      * Trade deal negotiated under Pres. H. W. Bush & steered through Congress
      by Pres. Clinton.

      * **Simple Overview:**A Lowered tariffs (taxes) between Canada, Mexico &
      U.S. so we could all do business more easily and cheaply.

      * Pres. Trump called it the “**single worst trade deal ever**” because he
      says it allowed American jobs to go to Mexico; many disagree.

      ## Why Now?


      Mexico & U.S negotiating NAFTA behind the scenes for weeks.


      * New government of Mexico *just* elected & both sides want to secure deal
      before new leadership takes office.

      * New trade deal needs approval by Congress; completing draft puts
      pressure on Congress to act before or after midterm elections.

      ## What’s At Stake?


      **American jobs, industry & pay.**


      One example of many potential changes: New “NAFTA” agreement reportedly
      requires **more** U.S. car parts made in America with more U.S. material
      (like steel) in exchange for the “no tax” benefit for companies.


      The Concern?

      ## Cost To Consumer


      > ‘The industry is hopeful that any changes to Nafta auto rules of origin
      continue to strike the right balance by **incentivizing production and
      investment in North America** while keeping new vehicles **affordable for
      more Americans**.’

      The North American Trade Agreement was a result of a trifecta of Mexico,
      Canada & the U.S. Since the U.S. & Mexico have a working template, the big
      question is: Will Canada agree to negotiations or stall them?
