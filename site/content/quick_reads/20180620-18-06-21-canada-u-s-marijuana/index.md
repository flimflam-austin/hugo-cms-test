      # GOING TO POT?


      ## Canada becomes the 2nd nation in the world to legalize marijuana – will
      the U.S. follow suit?


      New signs suggest the existing U.S. **federal ban _against_ marijuana
      could become a ban _against_ the federal gov’t interfering** in states
      where it’s legal.

      ## The (many) marijuana laws of the land:


      * In 1996, CA became 1st state to legalize **medical marijuana.**

      * In 1998, medical marijuana was legal in 5 states. By 2008, that number
      nearly tripled. **Today, it is legal in 29 states + DC.**

      * In 2012, Colorado & Washington became 1st statesA to legalize
      **recreational marijuana**.A **Today, it is legal in 9 states + DC.**

      ## Marijuana: State vs. Feds


      **Marijuana is illegal under federal law.** But, as more states began to
      legalize it within their borders, the federal gov’t shifted its focus away
      from prosecuting ***most* marijuana-related crimes** in situations where
      there is compliance with state laws.


      Instead, opting to focus on “**serious drug traffickers while taking into
      account state and local laws**.”

      ## Policy Change?


      * **January 2018:A** Atty General Jeff Sessions rescinded Obama-era
      policies that eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws, instead opting
      for a tougher stance.

      * **June 2018:** Just last week, Pres. Trump indicated he is willing to
      loosen the federal blanket ban on marijuana in states where it is legal.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Pres. Trump **did NOT say** he will end the federal ban on marijuana.

      * However, he DID say he is willing to support a federal bipartisan bill,
      which would **ease enforcement of the federal ban on marijuana in states
      where it’s legal.**

      * The bill would **NOT legalize marijuana** on the federal level or force
      states to take any action.
