      ## Something To Consider:


      * Saudi Arabia may allow American movies, orA partner w/U.S. in certain
      areas of foreign policy, but its **not a democracy**.

      * Saudi Arabia home to 2 holiest sites in Islam – important to entire
      Muslim world – millions make pilgrimages to sites.

      * Other Muslim nations like Bahrain and United Arab Emirates *already*
      show movies.

      ## So Why Outlaw Movies?


      * Saudi Arabia outlawed movies in 1979 because of a strict adherence to
      conservative Islam.

      * Saudi Arabia is still an Islamic monarchy.A Movies will undergo
      censorship of some sort – unclear how severe.

      * Experts ask if “reforms” are real or simply superficial.
