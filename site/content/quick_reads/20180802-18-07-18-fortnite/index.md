      ## What Is Fortnite Anyway?


      * Online brawl where 100 players leap out of a plane on to an island &
      fight until 1 person is left.

      * Hidden around the island are weapons & defense items.

      * As game goes on, playable area shrinks; forcing players closer.

      * Last survivor is the winner.

      * Epic Games just released Season 5.

      Heard of Flossing?  

      (And, no, not your teeth.)


      * 2018’s go-to dance move is all thanks to Fortnite.

      * During Fortnite, players can bust some dance moves to taunt an opponent,
      celebrate, or for fun.

      * To floss, you swing your hips frantically in the opposite direction of
      your arms & back again.
