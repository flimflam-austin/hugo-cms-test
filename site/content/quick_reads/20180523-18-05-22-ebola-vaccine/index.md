      logistical challenges.**” Vaccine needs transport at perfect temperature –
      and some of the travel “has limited road access.”

      ## Why Ebola Is Dangerous


      * **Quick Killer:** **Very infectious – Not very contagious**. A small
      amount can make you fatally sick. But it’s actually difficult to spread.
      It’s not airborne, but it is spread through direct contact with bodily
      fluids, exposure to contaminated objects from an infected person, and by
      handling infected meat.

      * Ebola killed**A 11,000+ inA Africa in 2014-2016**; 11 cases in U.S.
