      France's Culture Minister Franck Riester on plans to close the Eiffel
      Tower and Louvre Museum Saturday due to planned protests. The riots, now
      entering their 4th week, have grown increasingly violent. Protestors have
      also sprayed graffiti on famous French landmarks. The French gov't has
      cancelled plans for a fuel tax increase, but protestors vow to continue,
      fighting what they say is a high cost of living in France & a gov't that
      favors the rich.

      Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih as OPEC fails to reach a
      consensus on how much oil the 15-nation group will produce for the next 6
      months. Saudi Arabia wants to cut production by 1M barrels per day to stop
      oil's price slide but the group is waiting for Russia, a non-OPEC member,
      to commit. Oil prices dropped by the most in 2 weeks on the news. OPEC
      will meet again Friday.

      > “All of a sudden we started skidding, and then he started braking even
      more aggressively and then he was like, ‘brake!'”  
        
        
        
      Yvonne Dorr, Southwest Airlines passenger on a flight from Oakland to
      Burbank, after the 737 skidded off the runway to a sharp stop, just short
      of a CA freeway during a rainstorm. Cement blocks & sand-like ground

      injured.

      > “I just about fainted. I’ve never touched that much money and I don’t
      think I ever will again.”  
        
        
        
      Kevin Booth (32), a homeless man in Seattle, who found $17,000 in a bag
      outside of a food bank and turned it in. The food bank turned the money
      over to police who held it for the required 90 days, but no one claimed it
      so they returned it to the food bank, which gave a portion of it back to
      Booth to thank him for his honesty.
