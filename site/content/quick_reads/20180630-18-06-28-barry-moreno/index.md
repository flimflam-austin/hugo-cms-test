      > “Ellis Island was very unpopular much in the media. When it was opened
      it was very controversial, and as the years went on become more
      controversial.A So these things happening today, the issues are a little
      different but these controversies and some of the main points are the
      same.A There were some of the same issues about jobs, and crimes and
      terrorism, and all those things were leveled then in 1890.”
