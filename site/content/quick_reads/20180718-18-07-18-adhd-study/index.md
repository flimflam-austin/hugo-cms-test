      ## Why It Matters:


      * American Medical Association: teens watching videos, texting, posting,
      etc. more than 14x a day, showed **higher rates of ADHD** symptoms over
      two-year period.

      * However, researchers **fell short** of PROVING cause and effect.

      * Lingering Question: Can tech use **cause** ADHD, or do ADHD sufferers
      enjoy the stimulation of tech more than others?

      # ADHD: Defined


      > “Symptoms of ADHD include **inattention** (not being able to keep
      focus), **hyperactivity** (excess movement that is not fitting to the
      setting) and **impulsivity** (hasty acts that occur in the moment without
      thought).”

      ## Bigger Picture


      * No one knows the cause of ADHD.

      * Diagnosis rates have gone up (more than 40% between 2003 – 2011) though
      there’s some disagreement on total numbers.

      * Most diagnoses occur at a young age – around 6.

      * 1 out of 3 children with ADHD will retain diagnosis as adults.

      * Treatment = therapy & medication.
