      Revelations about new U.S. soldier deaths in places like Niger & Somalia
      and strikes in Syria have lawmakers questioning use of a nearly
      17-year-old law.

      ## What’s the Controversy?


      * Nearly 17 years later, AUMF is still being used, allowing Presidents
      Bush, Obama, & Trump to also fight _other_ terrorists around world.

      * America’s war on terror now stretches to no less than 76 countries (39%
      of the planet).

      * Lawmakers: time to take war off “autopilot.”

      Bipartisan AUMF Proposal  

      from Sens. Corker (R-TN) & Kaine (D-VA)


      * Broadly, it says a president can’t engage in prolonged or repeated
      incursions without consulting Congress on broader strategy.

      * Critics say it flips Constitution, requires 2/3rds to _disapprove_ war.

      * Fate unclear; Congress looks to avoid messy debate before midterms.

      In a separate study, released in November, Costs of War Project estimated
      the war on terror's price tag (with some future expenses included) has
      reached $5.6T - which some may argue is worth every penny. Click to read
      more & you decide.
