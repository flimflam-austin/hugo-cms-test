      > “If an officer shot somebody for breaking into cars, that would
      definitely not be a justified shooting. **They have to have reason, at the
      moment, that they felt that their life, or somebody else’s life, was in
      danger to do that**.”

* **What are the real numbers on police shootings?A** The latest CDC stats are from 2016, when police killed 549 people (118 black & 306 white (non-Hispanic)). However, those #s don’t reflect the fact that blacks make up less than 14% of pop, so it is important to look at the rate per 100,000 people. **While we know the race of the victims, we *often* don’t know the race of the police officers.A**  
Black RateA = .26  
White (non-Hispanic) Rate = .15  
**For comparison:** In the city of Chicago in 2016, 764 people died in shooting homicides.A Approximately 79% of them or 596 were black.
