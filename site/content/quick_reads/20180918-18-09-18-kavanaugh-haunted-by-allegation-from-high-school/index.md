      ## What’s At Stake?


      * Supreme Court Justice **serves for lifetime.**

      * Pres nominates Judge; **Senate must confirm.**

      * Court functions even if all 9 seats aren’t filled; currently 4 “left
      leaning” & 4 “conservative” justices.

      * Kavanaugh described as a “conservative” judge, which would tip the court
      to the “right.”

      reportedly on short list of Supreme Court nominees; declines going “on

      Professor Christine Blasey Ford describing what she says happened 30+
      years ago at a high school party when Kavanaugh and his friend allegedly
      trapped her in a room. She doesn't remember exact date or place - says
      everyone was drinking. She claims Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge jumped on
      top of them, causing them all to fall, and she freed herself.

      Mark Judge, friend of Brett Kavanaugh who the accuser says was in the room
      when the assault happened. Judge wrote a book about recovering from
      alcoholism. He has written for conservative news outlets; the accuser has
      donated to democratic campaigns.

      ## Timing Matters


      * Senate Judiciary Cmte was scheduled to vote THIS Thursday for/against
      Judge Kavanaugh. **This isn’t happening.**

      * **RepublicansA** want Kavanaugh confirmed before midterms (Nov) & next
      SCOTUS term (Oct).

      * **DemocratsA** want to delay vote; if Senate flips to Dem majority after
      midterms they can block Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

      ## Some Things To Consider:


      * Allegations never surfaced during ANY of Kavanaugh’s prior character
      checks (applying to law school, bar, or federal judge).

      * The accuser has NOT filed a criminal complaint, but her lawyers says she
      will share her story with the Senate.

      * No other accusers have come forward at this time.
