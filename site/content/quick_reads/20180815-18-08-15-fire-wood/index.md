      Fanning the Flames


      =====================


      ## 100+ Wildfires Burn Across America


      California’s Governor calls it “**the new normal**,” but as fires rage
      from Washington to New Mexico, with the Golden State the hardest hit, why
      there’s hope in a **wood that CAN’T catch fire.**

      # Will This Prevent Fires?


      ## Synthetic Wood Discovery


      * **Scientists created** *new* synthetic wood similar to plastic-wood
      composites used for decks, but synthetic wood **won’t burn.**

      * **Lightweight & high-strength** like real wood.

      * **Take hours to make**, unlike trees which take decades to grow.

      * **Price TBD**.

      ## Wildfire Destruction


      * **Why is it happening?A** It’s hot & dry/dead vegetation acts as fuel.

      * **Who’s to blame?** Often, humans but wildfires can ignite from
      innocuous activities like a boat trailer chain dragging on a road and
      sparking.

      * **Earlier than normal?** Yes, August is peak month.A Forecasters expect
      fires to slow in September before ramping up again in Oct.
