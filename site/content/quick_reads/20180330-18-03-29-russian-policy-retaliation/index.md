      ## Kremlin Twitter-plomacy


      * After the U.S. announced plans to close Russia’s embassy in Seattle, the
      official Twitter feed of the Russian U.S. embassy polled Twitter on which
      U.S. consulate in Russia should close in response.

      * **The Results?** St. Petersburg.

      * **Now?** Russia announced official plans to shut down that consulate.

      Important Context: 2017


      Just last year, Russia stripped U.S. diplomatic missions in Russia (ie.
      embassies & consulates) of 755 positions – mostly supporting staff – and
      mostly Russians – after the United States sanctioned the Kremlin for its
      action in the Ukraine.


      In return, America ordered Russia to close its SF consulate, & 2 annexes –
      1 in WashingtonA & 1 in NY.
