      I love you. And this is about hard work. And good luck. And not a whole
      lot else. You define me. Not this wonderful spot in the pavement.”_

      Garner received her star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday,
      accompanied by her children who apparently missed school, which she
      addressed by joking: "In the Garner family, fame matters more than
      education."
