      # The Art Of The Deal:


      ## Is POTUS walking away to move forward?


      Pres. Trump called off the June 12th meeting with North Korea. Is this all
      part of his strategy? We found something you have to see…

      > “I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, I feel
      it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting….The
      world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for
      lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth. That missed opportunity is
      a truly sad moment in history.”  
        
        
        
      Pres. Trump's May 24 letter to Kim Jong Un cancelling their upcoming
      meeting.

      ## “Art Of The Deal”


      > ‘My tone was more hurt than outraged or angry. I can be a screamer when
      I want to be, but in this case I felt screaming would only scare them
      off.”  
        
        
        
      President Trump in his 1987 book Art of The Deal. He was speaking about a
      real estate deal where he didn't want the other side to walk away.
      Considering the tone of his letter to North Korea, we thought this was
      worth your attention.

      ## Less Than 24 Hours After President Trump Sent His Letter…


      > North Korea says it’s still open to a sit-down.  
        
        
        
      “We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and
      resolve issues anytime and in any format …. we are open-minded in giving
      time and opportunity to the U.S.”

      Are the tactics working? Hours before Trump officially called off the
      meeting, N. Korea *claimed* it dismantled its only known nuclear test
      site. Journalists were present; official investigators were not.
