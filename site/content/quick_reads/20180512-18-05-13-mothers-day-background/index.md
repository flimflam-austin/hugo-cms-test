      * In **1908**, Jarvis organized the 1st Mother’s Day in West Virginia to
      honor her late mom who organized “Mothers’ Work Days” to improve women’s
      working conditions.

      * By **1910, West Virginia made it a holiday**, other states followed.

      * In 1914, **Congress declared the 2nd Sunday in May** (anniversary of
      Jarvis’ mom’s death) **as Mother’s Day**.

      By the 1920s, mothers nationwide were showered with candy, flowers, cards,
      & other gifts to celebrate Mother’s Day.


      Jarvis, frustrated with the commercialization of the holiday, that she
      intended as a day to **honor the role mothers play in the family, church,
      and community**, spent the rest of her life fighting against its
      commercial success.
