      # Historical Context  

      For Historic Times


      As Congress gets ready to vote on whether to impeach President Trump (for
      the second time), a look at how past is precedent.

      > _“The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United
      States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction
      of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”_


      Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution. The founders purposely
      left "high crimes" open-ended for Congress to decide. Consequently, the
      power of removing the U.S. president falls to the people's
      representatives.

      ## How It Works:


      * The House of Representatives can vote for impeachment, but only the
      Senate can convict.

      * House Judiciary Cmte. drafts “articles of impeachment” (charges); simple
      majority is needed to impeach in the House.

      * The Senate holds impeachment proceedings (trial). Conviction (removal
      from office) requires a 2/3 supermajority (67 of 100).

      ## Big Picture


      * 11 U.S. presidents faced at least one impeachment resolution in the
      House of Representatives.

      * Resolutions differed depending on the president, and some never became
      serious movements by the House to *actually* impeach the president.

      * In 2019, Pres. Trump became the third president to be impeached by the
      House.

      ## Pres. Andrew Johnson


      * **Impeached by House in 1868**, but avoided removal from office by a
      single Senate vote.

      * **Aftermath:** Johnson served out the remainder of his term as president
      and was later re-elected to the Senate.

      * **Context**: Pres. Johnson was the first president impeached by the
      House. 25 years earlier, Pres. Tyler was the first president to face an
      impeachment attempt by Congress; it quickly failed.

      ## Pres. Bill Clinton


      * **Impeached by House in 1998** for obstruction of justice & perjury in
      connection with his affair with Monica Lewinsky, and was acquitted in
      Senate.

      * **Aftermath:** Served two+ years after impeachment. Republicans lost
      public support – and House seats – during the impeachment process.

      * **Context**: Neither the House nor the Senate vote fell on entirely
      partisan lines.

      ## Pres. Richard Nixon


      * In 1974, the House Judiciary Cmte. approved impeachment articles for
      abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and contempt of Congress – all
      connected to the Watergate scandal.

      * **Aftermath:** Days later, the president resigned ahead of a full House
      vote.

      * **Context:** Pres. Nixon is the *only* U.S. president in history to
      resign.

      After the House votes, what happens next? After the House voted in 2019 to
      impeach Pres. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the
      Senate began its trial about one month later. The President was acquitted
      by the Senate.
