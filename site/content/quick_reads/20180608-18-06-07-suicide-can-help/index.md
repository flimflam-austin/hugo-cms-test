      ## CDC: Vital Signs Report


      * Examined data from 1999-2016

      * **Suicide rates increased in nearly every state** & half of those states
      had rates increase by 30%.

      ## Why A Dramatic Increase?


      **No simple answer.** Suicide is not JUST attributable to substance abuse,
      mental illness, or any single cause. Some experts say economic downturns
      played a role between 1999-2016 yet…


      * 4 out of 10 suicide cases reported relationship problems,

      * 29% – a crisis in the recent weeks

      * 22% – physical health problem.

      > ‘Suicide is a public health crisis when you look at the numbers, and
      they keep going up. It’s up everywhere. And we know that the rates are
      actually higher than what’s reported. But homicides still get more
      attention.’

      Suicide rates increased in nearly all 50 states. The one state where
      suicides did not increase between 1999-2016? Nevada. How can you help?
