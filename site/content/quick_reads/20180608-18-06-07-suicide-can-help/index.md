      ## Why A Dramatic Increase?


      **No simple answer.** Suicide is not JUST attributable to substance abuse,
      mental illness, or any single cause. Some experts say economic downturns
      played a role between 1999-2016 yet…


      * 4 out of 10 suicide cases reported relationship problems,

      * 29% – a crisis in the recent weeks

      * 22% – physical health problem.

      > ‘Suicide isA a public health crisis when you look at the numbers, and
      they keep going up. It’s up everywhere. And we know that the rates are
      actually higher than what’s reported. But homicides still get more
      attention.’

      suicides did not increase between 1999-2016? Nevada. How can you help?
