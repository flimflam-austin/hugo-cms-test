      U.S.  
        
      _“I do not wish to give [women] a first place, still less a second one –
      but the most complete freedom, to take their true place whatever it may
      be.”_

      ## Elizabeth Blackwell


      * Born February 3, 1821 in England.

      * Decided to study medicine after a sick friend believed she could have
      been treated better by a female doctor.

      * Admitted to Geneva Medical College in New York only because her
      application was believed to be a joke from the college’s rival school; she
      graduated at the top of her class.

      * **1857**: Opened the New York Infirmary for Women & Children with her
      sister (also a doctor) to provide jobs for women physicians & medical care
      to the poor.

      * **1867**: Opened a medical college for women in NYC.

      While men continue to outnumber women nearly 2:1 in the U.S. medical
      field, in 2019 more women than men enrolled in medical school for the very
      first time on record. The new Dir. of the CDC is Dr. Rochelle Walensky -
      the third woman to hold the post.
