_On the April afternoon when the Asheena was boarded, Lalla said, he was terrified.**The man talkin” Spanish, he point the gun at me, then he point at the water. I be knowin”. He be wantin” that I jump, he said.**So he leaped overboard. The first mate — Narendra Sankar, 22 — followed him moments later. The men were swimming toward an offshore oil rig when Sankar sufferedA a cramp.**I had already reached the rig, so I had to be jumpin” back in, to help him, Lalla said. He was goin” to be drownin”.**They watched as the pirates seized their vessel, outfitted with two expensive outboard motors. Their captain, Andell Plummer, was still aboard. The two men were rescued from the water by a passing fishing boat. When they reported the attack to authorities, Lalla said, they were told: We have no boat to go after them; we can do nothing.**There has been no word of Plummer since, the men say. Trinidad”s Ministry of National Security did not respond to a request for comment about his case.**My boy, they take him! said the captain”s father, Deoraj Balsingh, 58, standing by a muddy Trinidadian dock surrounded by boats.__We don”t know, Balsingh said. We don”t know if he livin” or if he dead._
