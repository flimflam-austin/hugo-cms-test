      In Arizona, New Mexico & California, Federal Govt controls 60-foot wide
      strip of land along the border. Not true in Texas, where almost all
      property is private. Click for one reason why a fence in Texas's Starr
      County has failed in the past.

The county”s largest cities sit in flood plains and local officials worry that border fencing could trap floodwaters in places like Roma after heavy rains.A** It”s not clear where in Starr County the border wall would go, but Border Patrol leaders have told the Statesman that the 500 or so agents who patrol the county are woefully understaffed.
