      > “_Talk to the person sitting alone. Hug a crying child. Say hello to a
      stranger. Call a friend having a hard time. Take a moment to do something
      for someone else. Love each other better. Kindness can cause a ripple
      effect. And small gestures can create very big change. I’m living proof.”_

      Hoff and her husband sat in the fourth row at the Route 91 Harvest Music
      Festival in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 when 58 people were murdered.
      Neither were shot, but both were forever changed. Hoff wrote about their
      ordeal for Refinery 29.
