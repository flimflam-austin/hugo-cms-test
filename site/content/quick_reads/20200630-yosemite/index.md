      # June 30, 1864


      During the height of the Civil War, Pres. Abraham Lincoln turns his gaze
      west, granting Yosemite Valley to California, with the specific orders to
      preserve it for future generations of Americans.

      > “I have seen persons of emotional temperament stand with tearful eyes,
      spellbound and dumb with awe, as they got their first view of the Valley
      from Inspiration Point, overwhelmed in the sudden presence of the
      unspeakable, stupendous grandeur.”


      The first guardian of the Yosemite Grant, Galen Clark helped oversee the
      land known later as Yosemite National Park. Yosemite was the name of the
      local Native American tribe in the area.

      “Nearly all the park is a profound solitude. Yet it is full of charming
      company, full of God’s thoughts, a place of peace and safety amid the most
      exalted grandeur and eager enthusiastic action, a new song, a place of
      beginnings abounding in first lessons on life, mountain-building, eternal,
      invincible, unbreakable order; with sermons in stones, storms, trees,
      flowers, and animals brimful of humanity.”

      By the 1870s, there were already concerns about too many visitors
      impacting Yosemite. Muir was one of the many voices who argued
      (successfully) for Yosemite to become a National Park in 1890 - the third
      in the nation after Yellowstone and Sequoia.
