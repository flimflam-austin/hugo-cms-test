      ## The BIG Picture


      * AP analysis: Important counties in swing states have not seen job
      losses; areas that backed Clinton in 2016 have better job growth than
      areas that voted for Pres. Trump.

      * Pew Research poll raises question about whether or not jobs are the TOP
      priority for voters during this particular midterm election.

      ## What To Watch: Aug 7


      * **Ohio:** Important swing state. President Trump held rally in Ohio on
      Saturday.

      * In Focus: **A special election for Congress.** Polls show a
      traditionally Republican district with a very tight race.

      * **Democrats need to flip 24 seats from R to D.** Will this be one for
      them?
