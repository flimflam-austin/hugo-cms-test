      which is why Florida’s legislature overwhelmingly voted to make it
      permanent last year.’

      states that like Florida follow Daylight Savings Time, citing decreased

      Arizona, Hawaii & US Territories like Puerto Rico:A don't follow DST. By
      the way, there's a lot of confusion between "Daylight Savings Time" &
      "Daylight Saving" Time. ...We went with the law: Daylight Savings Time but
      its written differently everywhere!
