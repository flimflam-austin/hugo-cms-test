      > ‘Studies have shown many benefits of a year-round Daylight Saving Time,
      which is why Florida’s legislature overwhelmingly voted to make it
      permanent last year.’  
        
        
        
      Sen. Marco Rubio on the Sunshine Protection Act that would apply to ALL
      states that like Florida follow Daylight Savings Time, citing decreased
      car accidents & decreased robberies both reasons behind the fight for more
      light.

      Arizona, Hawaii & US Territories like Puerto Rico:A don't follow DST. By
      the way, there's a lot of confusion between "Daylight Savings Time" &
      "Daylight Saving" Time. ...We went with the law: Daylight Savings Time but
      its written differently everywhere!
