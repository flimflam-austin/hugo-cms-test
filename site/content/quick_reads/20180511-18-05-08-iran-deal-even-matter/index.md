      ## What About Terrorism?


      * Iran = labeled by U.S. as a **state sponsor of terror since 1984**.

      * Pres. Trump led remarks: “_The Iranian regime is the **leading state
      sponsor of terror**._“

      ## Meanwhile, Inside Iran…


      > _“The sense of crisis in Iran runs deep and wide. The economy is in free
      fall. The currency is plummeting. Rising prices are squeezing city
      dwellers. A five-year drought is devastating the countryside. The pitched
      battle between political moderates and hard-liners is so perilous that
      there is even talk of a military takeover.”_
