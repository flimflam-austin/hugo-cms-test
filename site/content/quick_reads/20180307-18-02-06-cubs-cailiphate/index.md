      > “The children were paralyzed by fear of (the ringleader), who they
      understood to have connections to terrorists and who essentially told them
      that a violent fate would befall them if they told anyone what he was
      doing. **They were too afraid to confide in anyone**.”

      ## Why It Matters:


      Despite the much-discussed territorial defeat of ISIS in places like
      Syria, their ideology has **no border.**


      The focus on training young children shows ISIS has a “long game”
      strategy.


      **The SmartHER question:** Does America have a game plan to counter it?
