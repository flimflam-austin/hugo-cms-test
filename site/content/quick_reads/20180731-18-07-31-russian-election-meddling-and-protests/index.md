      ## What Happened?


      * American utility companies infiltrated by Russian hackers **over the
      last 2 years**.

      * Russians used **phishing scams** (where a fake email prompts the user to
      change their password & hacker gets the info) to infiltrate systems and
      steal data.

      * Number and extent of attacks is reportedly unknown.

      Russian hackers have access to control panels in several of America’s
      power plants (NYT).


      Russians could hypothetically access these control rooms through remote
      control (and they’ve done it before in Ukraine).
