      > “Wastewater from an entire dorm, or an entire segment of a campus, could
      be tested to determine whether there is coronavirus in that sewage.”  
        
      Adm. Brett Giroir, a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health
      Service, on "experimental approaches, that look interesting, if not
      promising" for COVID-19 surveillance, answering a Senate hearing question
      about how children & young adults can safely return to school.

      ## Wait. What?


      * Scientists track _viral shedding_: how & when a sick person spreads the
      virus & level of contagion in different scenarios.

      * Genetic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19) is present
      in stool samples (**though we don’t know if it can spread that way**).

      * **Why It Matters:** Monitoring wastewater *may* help early detection of
      COVID-19 cases in communities (without relying on individual tests).

      ## What To Know:


      * **Precedent:** Researchers have looked at city wastewater for presence
      of opioids, hormones.

      * **Vancouver, WA** sending daily sewage samples to Arizona State Univ, a
      leading lab in this field.

      * **Bend, Oregon**: one of 300+ cities participating in a study with a bio
      startup aligned w/ Harvard, MIT.

      * CDC to _Politico_: Gov’t itself considering monitoring sewage but hasn’t
      yet.

      ## Something To Consider:


      > “There is not a lot of evidence of transmission through stools. I know
      at least one tabloid in the UK got a lot of coverage by someone
      speculating that COVID-19 could be spread by flatulence or, to quote the
      headline, by farting. There really is not a lot of science behind that.”  
        
      CDC Deputy Dir. for Infectious Diseases, Dr. Jay Butler.

      A lead researcher in wastewater surveillance refers to our sewage systems
      as “the information superhighway under your feet.” Just how much sewage
      would be needed to get an accurate read of COVID-19 community outbreaks is
      TBD.
