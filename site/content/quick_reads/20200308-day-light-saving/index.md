      ## 3 Things To Know About Daylight Saving Time (DST)


      1. Not intended to make longer days for farmers, but rather to help
      conserve energy used for light/heat (coal) during WWI.

      2. The need for DST has always been a topic of debate. Today, about 70
      countries observe DST – that’s less than 40% of world.

      3. Daylight saving time lasts 8 months. Standard time lasts 4 months.

      ## ORIGINS


      * Federal gov’t mandated daylight saving time (DST) in 1918 during
      **WWI**, & again during **WWII**.

      * **1966:** Congress standardized DST start & end dates requiring
      observing states to be in sync, but allowed states to opt out.

      * **2005:** Congress re-set the start of DST to the 2nd Sunday in March &
      set the end for the 1st Sunday in November.

      ## Did You Know?


      **States are not required to observe DST, but congressional approval is
      required to keep year-round daylight saving time**


      * Nine states have passed laws to keep year-round (permanent) daylight
      saving time, which await Congress’ approval.

      * Two states – Arizona (except Navajo territories) and Hawaii – as well as
      five major U.S. territories, don’t observe DST & keep year-round standard
      time.

      > _“I prefer Daylight Savings over Standard but in the end what I really
      want is to end this stupid twice a year time shift. Let’s
      #LockTheClock_“  
        
      Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who has introduced two federal bills since 2018 to
      eliminate the time shift and make daylight saving time permanent.
      President Trump has also voiced his support for keeping year-round
      daylight saving time.

      Changing our clocks was controversial from the beginning with complaints
      about BIG gov't. According to a 2019 poll by the Associated Press, less
      than a third of people like switching the clocks twice each year. What
      would you prefer? See if your state has pending legislation on our source
      page.
