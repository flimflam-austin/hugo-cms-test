      residential care communities – t**hat’s roughly 1% of the U.S.
      population.**

      * At least 20% of deaths have taken place in nursing homes & long-term
      care facilities. This doesn’t include people who lived/worked at the
      facilities and died in hospitals. Overall: **An estimated 34% of U.S.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Older adults are not more susceptible to COVID, but they are more prone
      to severe cases which may result in hospitalization or death. **At least
      80% of U.S. COVID-19 deaths occurred in people age 65 or older.**

      * COVID is more likely to spread in congregate settings like nursing
      homes, where people live and work in close contact and social distancing
      is more challenging.

      ## CONTEXT


      * Nursing homes, subject to federal guidelines and state rules, confronted
      a lack of COVID-19 preparedness.

      * Many states & facilities struggled with mitigation efforts such as
      testing & whether to accept COVID patients from hospitals. New York &
      other states ordered nursing homes to accept COVID patients, a
      controversial policy some say freed-up hospital resources but led to
      further infections and deaths.

      "The question is, are they going down because of the vaccine, or are they
      going down because we’re on the backside of the outbreak. … It’s a
      combination of both." Dr. David Gifford, American Health Care Assn.'s
      chief medical officer, on how to interpret recent nursing home amid
      declines in cases & deaths nationwide.
