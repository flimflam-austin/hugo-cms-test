      ## Turns out a prison on an island = EXPEN$IVE


      * All food & supplies shipped in.

      * No fresh water. _(1M gallons of water barged in weekly.)_

      * **$3-5M** needed just for repairs.

      * **3 times more expensive** to operate. (_In 1959, the daily cost per
      inmate at Alcatraz was $10.10 vs. $3 at a U.S. prison in Atlanta._)

      * U.S. Gov’t: more cost effective to close Alcatraz & build new.

      ## Alcatraz’s Great Mystery


      What happened to brothers **John & Clarence Anglin** and **Frank Morris**?


      In 1962, the 3 bank robbers dug holes in their cells with sharpened spoons
      & used life vests to try and sail to the mainland.


      No one knows if they made it.

      Prison to Tourist Hot Spot


      After the prison closed in 1963, Alcatraz was essentially abandoned.


      In 1969, a group on Native American activists occupied the island for 2
      years, claiming the land.


      In 1972, Alcatraz added to the Golden Gate Nat’l Recreation Area.


      Now 1M tourists visit each year.
