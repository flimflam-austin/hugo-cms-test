      ## Refresher: DACA


      * **D**eferred **A**ction For **C**hildhood **A**rrivals.

      * DACA status can be granted to those who came into America illegally as
      children – essentially “defers” illegal status & allows eligibility for
      work permits.

      * Pres. Trump: **Offered citizenship for DACA recipients** in State of the
      Union speech as part of broader immigration reform.

      ## What’s The Drama?


      * White House: Wants $$ for border wall (a campaign promise)A **A.S.A.P**
      – $$ must come from Congress. Hence, back-and-forth now ahead of spending
      bill.

      * **Report:** Dems want more illegal immigrants eligible for a pathway to
      citizenship – a non-starter for GOP who didn’t like Trump’s offer of
      citizenship for DACA recipients to begin with.

      ## Big Picture


      * Immigration Reform ***could*** be part of broader $pending bill to fund
      govt through September but it can also be separate. **It’s NOT a need –
      but a want – for some.**

      * Congress has until Friday night to pass a spending bill or the gov’t
      shuts down – for the **3rd time this year**.

      * Potentially last big legislative fight before mid-term elections in Nov.

      Immigration reform isn't the only issue of debate. P.S. In 1977, the
      government shut down 3x under President Carter. in 2018, the government
      has shut down 2x. Let's see if we make the history books:
