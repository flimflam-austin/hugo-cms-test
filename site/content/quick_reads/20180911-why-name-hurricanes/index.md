      ## Who Names The Storms?


      * Naming handled by **World Meteorological Organization**.

      * List of names set every 6 years.

      * Assigned alphabetically, alternating men vs. women. Every season starts
      on “A” & rarely goes through entire alphabet.

      * **You’ll never hear of another “Hurricane Katrina” because names of
      infamous deadly and destructive storms are retired**.
