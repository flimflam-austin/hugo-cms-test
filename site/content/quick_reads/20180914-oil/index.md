      # Don’t Mess with Texas


      * U.S. produces 11M barrels oil per day – more than any country in the
      world for **1stA time since 1973**.

      * Texas is responsible for **one-fifth of U.S. production**A due to shale
      drilling boom.

      * **Texas is now on track to produce more oil than Iraq & Iran;**A Mideast
      instability has impacted that region’s oil markets.

      ## Why It Matters


      * More production at home makes the U.S. less reliant on volatile Middle
      East, creating more jobs for production & distribution.

      * Also important to remember: **Oil is a global market.** If Saudi Arabia
      or Russia ramped up production dramatically, it could drive prices lower –
      potentially to a point that would make extracting oil from shale not worth
      it financially.

      The Department of Energy expects US oil production next year to continue
      at this pace or slightly higher, allowing it to remain the world's #1 oil
      producer through 2019.
