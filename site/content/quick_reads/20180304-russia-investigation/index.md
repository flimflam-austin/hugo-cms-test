      > “It’s very clear that Russia meddled in the election. It’s also very
      clear that it didn’t have an impact on the election. And it’s also very
      clear that the Trump campaign didn’t collude with the Russians in any way
      for this process to take place.”

      ## For Your Consideration


      The latest 32-count indictment against Paul Manafort & Rick Gates accuses
      them of filing false tax returns, failing to file foreign bank accounts,
      and bank fraud – although the crimes they’re accused of are unrelated to
      their work for Trump, some took place around US election.

      # BOTTOM LINE


      Indictments & guilty pleas are speeding up.


      Some cases have serious potential jail time at stake; others will never
      see the inside of a courtroom.


      We don’t know when the investigation will end; there isn’t a timeline, but
      the pace of indictments indicates progress.
