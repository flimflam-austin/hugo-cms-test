      > “You may well see significant rises in unemployment and significant
      declines in economic activity, but there can also be a good rebound on the
      other side of that.”


      Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell explained that while we may be in a
      recession, it's not a normal recession because there's nothing
      fundamentally wrong with the U.S. economy. He added the first order of
      business is to get COVID-19 under control and that will dictate the
      timetable for the economic recovery ahead.

      ## YOUR HOME


      Evictions and foreclosures for renters & homeowners suspended in some
      cases.


      * **Mortgages:** 60-day moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for
      single family homeowners with federally-insured mortgages. Gov’t directed
      mortgage lenders to do the same – some have done so in states like CA.

      * **FYI:** Many cities and counties have enacted temporary eviction bans.
