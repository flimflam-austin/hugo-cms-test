      Rare Monday in Senate  

      “Open Debate”


      * Open Debate = _Just that_

      * Any senator can bring legislation or amendments for consideration.

      * Why now? **IMMIGRATION**

      * Why It Matters? Coming off last week’s compromise on a budget bill,
      Senate *could* continue bipartisanship on immigration reform.

      > ‘We’re going to have something in the Senate that we haven’t had in a
      while. It’s a real debate on an issue where we really don’t know what the
      outcome is going to be.’

      # Why Now?


      ## Clock is Ticking Toward A Deadline


      In September, President Trump announced the winding down of the DACA
      program and gave Congress until March 5th to come up with comprehensive
      immigration plan.

      # Important To Know:


      * President Obama used executive action to create DACA.

      * President Trump can use executive action to rescind DACA.

      * Both sides arguably use DACA as bargaining for larger immigration
      reform.

      * Congress originates laws – For immigration reform to last, it needs to
      come from Congress.
