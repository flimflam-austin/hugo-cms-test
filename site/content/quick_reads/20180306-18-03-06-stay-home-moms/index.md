      > “Put simply, stay-at-home parents were about **half** as likely to get a
      callback as unemployed parents and only**A one-third** as likely as
      employed parents.”

      > “My research shows that, after being pushed out, (mothers) are kept out
      & have reduced job opportunities when attempting to regain employment.A
      When fathers opt out…they too face penalties, and in some contexts greater
      penalties than opt out mothers.”

      ## Study Shows Vicious Cycle


      * Stay-at-home parents are seen as less reliable & dependable thanA others
      because they are perceived as caring about family more than work.

      * An all-encompassing work life forces many parents out of traditional
      roles. It’s those same ‘expectations’ that keep them from re-entering the
      workforce.
