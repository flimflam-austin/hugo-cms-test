      ## Why is FB Being Sued?


      * Facebook offers companies ways to advertise or “target” certain people
      by age, gender, etc.

      * Housing groups suing say this FB feature allows “landlords and real
      estate brokers to exclude families with children, women, and other
      protected classes of people from receiving housing ads.’

      * **Bottom Line: FB is accused of enabling housing discrimination.**

      ## A Tough Few Weeks for FB


      * Scandal over mishandling users’ data and not protecting profile data
      from the hands of private companies to use for their own gain. Founder
      Mark Zuckerberg will reportedly testify before Congress on this issue.

      * Stock dropped dramatically (wiping away $80B ofA market value).

      * FB denies lawsuit allegations.

      # Speaking of Housing…


      Would you live INSIDE  

      “Facebookville”?


      * FB is building its own small community in California near its HQ: Willow
      Park

      * 1500 apartments – 15% for low income residents – the other 85% catered
      towards FB employees (who receive a bonus for living near work).

      Like Facebook, Google plans to build a community too. So have many other
      great American companies in the past. Does the social media component of
      the tech companies heighten the "creep factor" of these communities? You
      decide.
