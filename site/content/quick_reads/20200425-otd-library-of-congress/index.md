      ## ORIGINS


      * 1800: As part of moving the U.S. gov’t from PA to the newly formed
      capital in D.C., Pres. Adams approved $5k for a congressional library.
      First books took a year to arrive from England.

      * The Library survived two devastating fires (one when the British burned
      the Capitol in 1814, another accidental in 1851) – much of its early
      contents burned.

      * “The Library” now occupies 3 buildings.

      they would stretch from Washington D.C. to Cape Canaveral, Florida.
