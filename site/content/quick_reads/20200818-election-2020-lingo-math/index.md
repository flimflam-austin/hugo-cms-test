      general election during state **primaries** & **caucuses.** Results
      determine how **delegates** vote at party conventions.

      * **AUG:** Dems & GOP delegates vote for their party’s candidate at
      **conventions**.

      ## Delegates & Conventions

      selected by delegates at conventions.

      * There are **2,551** Republican delegates at stake and **4,750** at stake
      for Democrats.

      * Each party drafts its own rules on how delegates are awarded to

      ## Primaries & Caucuses


      * **Caucuses:** Differs by party, but usually voters gather at public
      locations to debate and then vote in multiple rounds until a “winner” gets
      the required number of votes.

      * **Primaries:** Voters cast secret ballots – like general elections
      statewide. Some states hold “open” primaries, where any registered voter
      can vote regardless of party affiliation (ex: registered GOP can vote in
      SC Democratic primary).

      electors (**Electoral College** members) who pledged to vote for candidate
      that wins popular vote in your state.

      * Each state receives the # of **electors** equal to its # of
      representatives (based on population) & senators (two).

      * Electoral College has **538** electors – majority (**270**) votes needed
      to win. House of Representatives decides if tie.
