      # BRAIN POWER


      As America continues to honor Sen. John McCain,A brain cancer research
      delivers quiteA literallyA **mind-altering innovations.**

      ## Why Do We Call It Cancer?


      > “The word cancer is derived from the Latin word for crab because cancers
      are often very irregularly shaped, and because, like a crab, they “grab on
      and don’t let go.”  
        
        
        
      Johns Hopkins University describes cancer as irregular cell growth that
      can turn deadly. Est. 1 out of 100 cancer diagnoses will be brain cancer;
      it's also the second most common form of cancer in children (behind
      Leukemia).

      ## Brain Cancer Boost?


      (beyond radiation, chemo & surgery)


      * **Cancer Vaccines & Immunotherapy:** Help the body recognize a brain
      tumor as an “invader” and attack it.

      * **Tumor Treating Fields or TTF:** A wearable device (like a cap) that
      uses electric fields to disrupt tumor growth (forA glioblastoma -the
      cancer Sen. McCain had).

      > ‘Just to use this ad that used to be out, ‘This is not your father’s
      Oldsmobile.’ Well, this is not your father’s brain tumor either. I want
      sort of give a message of hope to patients. The future will add to these
      treatments and make it even better.”  
        
        
        
      Dr. Suriya Jeyapalan, Tufts Medical Center neurologist, speaking about
      brain cancer to survivornet.com.

      Novocure, the company using Tumor Treatment Fields, received FDA approval
      for treating Glioblastoma using its device (with chemotherapy). It's also
      working on a device for lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.

Treatment innovations  
Brain cancer research is a very active field of study. Researchers are investigating new ways to deliver drugs to brain tumors, including pumps that release a continuous, slow flow of chemotherapy or targeted drug therapies to a tumor. This type of treatment is called convection-enhanced delivery (CED).  
Another type of therapy uses technology called tumor treating fields (Optune) to deliver electric fields to the brain, which can help stop the proliferation of cancer cells. Optune is a wearable, portable device and is used in combination with temozolomide to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults.  
Implanted, biodegradable wafer therapy (Gliadel) relies on an implanted disc to release chemotherapy to tumor tissue that remains after surgery. And in nanoparticle therapy, particles with an unusually high surface area carry chemotherapy across the blood-brain barrier directly to a tumor.
