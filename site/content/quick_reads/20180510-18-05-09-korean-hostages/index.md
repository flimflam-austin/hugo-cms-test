      ## Something To Consider:


      > ‘We are happy they’ve returned, but North Korea shouldn’t gain by taking
      Americans and then releasing them.”  
        
        
        
      Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) May 9, 2018 warning more Americans could be

      > “**It represents something**. It represents something very important to
      this country. People never thought a thing like this could happen and it
      can. People never thought you were going to have a situation where we’re
      having serious & positive communication with North Korea and we are. What
      happens? Who knows? We have a chance at something really great for the
      world.”
