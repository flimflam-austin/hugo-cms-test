      > “President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States
      and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the
      democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and
      imperiled a coordinate branch of government.”


      The article of impeachment charges "incitement of insurrection" for Pres.
      Trump's words & conduct in the days & moments leading up to the riot.

      ## TRIAL BASICS


      * The Senate impeachment trial is not a criminal trial, but it will look
      like one.

      * House impeachment managers (lawmakers chosen by the House) will
      “prosecute,” presenting the case for impeachment to the Senate; the fmr.
      president’s lawyers will defend him.

      * Senators will vote on procedural motions (ex: whether to allow
      witnesses), impeachment, and *perhaps ultimately* disqualification.

      ## ARGUMENTS


      * House impeachment managers will argue Pres. Trump provoked illegal
      action. They’ll also argue the trial is constitutional b/c otherwise
      outgoing presidents may engage in wrongful conduct without recourse.

      * Pres. Trump’s lawyers will argue he did not incite violence and his
      speech is protected under the First Amendment. They’ll argue the trial is
      unconstitutional since Pres. Trump is not in office.

      ## WHAT TO EXPECT


      * **Tuesday:** Each side has up to 2 hours to argue the constitutionality
      of holding the trial after the former pres. left office. Next, the Senate
      votes; 51 votes are needed to move forward with the trial.

      * **Starting Wednesday:** Each side has up to 16 hours over 2 days to
      argue their case. Next, senators may ask questions for up to 4 hours.
      Then, each side has up to 2 hours for closing arguments before the Senate
      begins deliberations.

      ## UNKNOWNS


      * **Witnesses & Evidence:** Whether the Senate will vote to allow the
      parties to call witnesses or subpoena evidence.

      * **Ties:** Whether Vice Pres. Harris may cast any tiebreaking vote(s).
      The VP (as the Senate president) may cast tie-breaking votes in Senate
      proceedings.

      * **Disqualification:** Whether Congress may vote to disqualify former
      Pres. Trump from holding future public office regardless of whether the
      Senate votes to convict.

      ## BIG PICTURE


      * **Zero:** No president has ever been convicted in a Senate impeachment
      trial.

      * **67 of 100:** Conviction requires a 2/3 supermajority in the Senate.
      Assuming all 50 Democrats vote to convict, they’ll need 17 Republicans to
      join them.

      * **51 of 100:** Disqualification from office requires a simple majority.
      Assuming all 50 Democrats vote to disqualify, they’ll need one Republican
      to join them.

  - order: 8
    body: >-
      Pres. Trump is only the third president ever impeached but the fourth to
      face impeachment proceedings. Impeachment proceedings began against Pres.
      Nixon, but he resigned before the House had the opportunity to vote.
