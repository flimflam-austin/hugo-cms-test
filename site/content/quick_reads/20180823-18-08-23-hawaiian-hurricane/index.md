      # COLLISION COURSE


      Despite being an island paradise in the middle of wide open ocean,
      hurricanes rarely hit Hawaii.  

      **Why?**

      ## Why So Rare?


      > ‘You’re a pretty small spot in a large ocean, and to have something hit
      you takes a bit of an unfortunate alignment of things.’  
        
        
        
      Brian McNoldy, University of Miami meterologist says only 5 storms as
      strong as Hurricane Lane have EVER been recorded *near* Hawaii. Wind
      patterns tend to keep storms away.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Hawaii marked its anniversary as America’s 50th state **this week** on
      Aug 21 (1959) – only state that’s all islands.

      * Since hurricanes rarely hit Hawaii, higher risk of significant damage:
      not enough shelters, less prepared, difficult to reach.

      * All 8 islands in danger.

      * Officials want citizens to have essential supplies for 14 days.

      ## 2018 Hurricane Season


      >   
        
      ‘It is very important to remember that it only takes one landfalling
      tropical cyclone to bring major impacts to the State of Hawaii.’


      * June 1 – November 30th.

      * May 23 NOAA forecast predicted average / above average cyclone activity
      (3-6 storms) this season in the Pacific. One warning?

      # What’s The Difference?

      ## Cyclone vs. Hurricane

      > **NOTHING.**  
      You might hear both.  
        
        
        
      “Hurricanes and typhoons are the same weather phenomenon:  
      tropical cyclones.”

      NOAA forecasts suggest a "normal" hurricane season for the Atlantic (0-2
      major hurricanes). Want to see how rare it is for Hawaii to have a
      hurricane? Check out an amazing graphic from NOAA on our source page as
      well as an update on the Kilauea Volcano eruptions.
