      Infrastructure Plan: WH


      * Official plan revealed Monday.

      * Cost Estimate: $1.5 trillion

      * Big News? Will reportedly change infrastructure funding so permit
      approval is faster but funding is more state-driven.

      * Critics: More burden on states will mean more toll roads/fees for
      citizens & state’s needing controversial private investment (some
      like/dislike).
