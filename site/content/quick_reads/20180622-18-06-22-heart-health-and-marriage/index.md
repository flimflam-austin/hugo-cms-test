      ## Why Marriage?


      Results same for married vs single, divorced OR widowed.


      * Security: Married people may seek medical help sooner (they have someone
      around to nag them to go to the doctors OR to see changes in behavior).

      * Economic: Couples may have better joint income & therefore, better
      healthcare.
