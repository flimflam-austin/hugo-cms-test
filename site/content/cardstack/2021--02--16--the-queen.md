    ## The Queen & Her Jewels


    * Among her many royal crowns & tiaras, one of the Queen's most-worn pieces is the **Vladimir Tiara.** ‍

    * It was originally crafted for a Russian Duchess, and smuggled out of Russia between 1917-1920.

    * Queen Mary, the Queen's grandmother, bought the tiara in 1921 & added the ability to switch out the jewels; besides its diamonds, the Queen may also add emeralds or pearls.
