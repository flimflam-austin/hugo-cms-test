    Here's [Bly's travel
    list](https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/learn/women-forging-way/nellie-bly-around-the-world):


    "…two traveling caps, three veils, a pair of slippers, a complete outfit of toilet articles, ink-stand, pens, pencils, and copy-paper, pins, needles and thread, a dressing gown, a tennis blazer, a small flask and a drinking cup, several complete changes of underwear, a liberal supply of handkerchiefs and fresh ruchings and most bulky and uncompromising of all, a jar of cold cream to keep my face from chapping in the varied climates I should encounter."

    A Nevada newspaper reflecting on Bly's trip during an unexpected pandemic of 1889. The pandemic, caused by the "Russian" or "Asiatic" flu, impacted travel for many and caused symptoms including fever, cough, headache, and fatigue; more serious cases resulted in pneumonia or heart failure.
