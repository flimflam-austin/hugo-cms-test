*   The CDC warns that both travel and gathering with people who you do not live can increase the chances of getting or spreading COVID-19.
*   The [advice](\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/thanksgiving.html\") comes one week ahead of the holiday after more than 1 million COVID-19 cases were reported in America over the last 7 days.
*   Many states and cities have recently announced additional gathering restrictions ahead of Thanksgiving.
*   The CDC says there are three things everyone can to celebrate safely: wear a mask, stay at least six feet away from people who donâ€™t live with you, and wash your hands often.
