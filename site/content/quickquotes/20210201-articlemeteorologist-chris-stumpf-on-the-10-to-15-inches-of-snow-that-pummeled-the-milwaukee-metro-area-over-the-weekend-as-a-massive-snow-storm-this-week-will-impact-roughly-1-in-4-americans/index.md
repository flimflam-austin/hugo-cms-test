*   Many parts of the Midwest already have several inches of snow blanketing the ground as 80 million Americans were under winter storm watches, advisories or warnings over the weekend.
*   Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have activated state emergency operations in preparation for possible whiteout travel conditions and power outages amid blizzard-like weather (up to 18 inches of snow possible)
*   Snowstorms mean snow days, right? Virginia math teacher, Bill Drake, said virtual classes eliminate the need, but not the desire: “It’s hard to expect students to focus when there is a fresh blanket of snow just outside their windows.”

**Why It Matters:** This will be the biggest snow in years for many parts of the country, potentially disrupting travel and the movement of goods at some of the nation’s largest travel hubs.

Local officials urged anyone in the path of the storm to prepare their homes and stock up on necessities. Learn simple steps to prep for a winter storm, [here](https://weather.com/safety/winter/news/2019-01-30-how-to-prepare-for-blizzards).
