*   **Americans continue to shop despite the pandemic.** [Consumer spending increased .5% in October.](\"https://apnews.com/article/consumer-spending-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-8fa1084d53063d4a9e895995a5f85a02\")
    *   An increase in spending is important for the economy as two-thirds of economic growth in the U.S. is determined by consumer spending.
    *   The U.S. is the largest economy in the world so what happens stateside has ripple effects.
    *   This barometer on the consumer spending is the lowest since April and down from the previous months.
*   **The number of Americans filing for unemployment increased.** [Jobless claims](\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/25/us-weekly-jobless-claims.html\") increased again in the latest week from the previous week: 778,000. This number is a five week high.
    *   The increase is notable because this weekly data point had shown some improvement (lower number of Americans filing for unemployment).
    *   Some analysis: “Weekly unemployment insurance claims are moving in the wrong direction with the first back-to-back increases since July. Together with a slower-than-expected drop in continuing claims, we’re seeing the effects of rapidly-rising Covid-19 cases across the country. ” [Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union](\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-hit-5-week-high-as-record-coronavirus-wave-triggers-more-layoffs-11606312161?mod=home-page\").
*   **Why This Matters:** American spending power fuels the U.S. economy and by proxy – adds momentum to the world economy as well. With COVID cases on the rise, and restrictions once again impacting not only business owners but would-be consumers, the focus turns again to Congress and whether or not another stimulus plan with support (added unemployment benefits, loans) will pass before the Christmas holiday.
