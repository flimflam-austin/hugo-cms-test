*   Dr. Birx [explained](\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/08/02/sotu-birx-on-virus.cnn\") that the virus is now more far-reaching than when it first struck hard in March & April as now those in **rural and urban areas** are equally susceptible.
*   In terms of what we can do going forward, Dr. Birx [warned](\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2008/02/sotu.01.html\") that individuals must stop attending “**super-spreading events**” of multiple people without masks, and that communities must react quickly with “significant mitigation efforts” at the first sign of increased positivity rates ahead of increased hospital cases.
*   When asked specifically about former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb’s remarks that the total number of **COVID-19 deaths** could reach 300,000 by the end of the year, Dr. Birx [said](\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2008/02/sotu.01.html\") “_anything is possible_” and that it depends “_completely on the red states, those states across the South and the West, maintaining and accelerating their mitigation efforts. It depends on the yellow states accelerating theirs. And, frankly, the green states, like areas of Illinois, where we’re — and Philadelphia, we are starting to see this tick up._“
