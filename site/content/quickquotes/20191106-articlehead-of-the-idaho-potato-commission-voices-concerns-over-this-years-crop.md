*   President and CEO of the Idaho Potato Commission Frank Muir speaking about Americaâ€™s potato harvest.
*   Bad weather impacted this yearâ€™s crop, making it smaller than last years.
*   **Why It Matters**: Idaho produces about a third of Americaâ€™s potatoes. And we all love french fries. ![\"ðŸ™‚\"](\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f642.svg\") Muir predicts we may see a small rise in prices, but the less than impressive crop should not have a significant impact on our menu options.
