*   El Paso’s hospitals have experienced a [300% increase of patients in \*less\* than 3 weeks](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/25/el-paso-coronavirus-stay-home/) related to the COVID pandemic.
*   The city issued a new stay-at-home request, with the exception of essential travel or work.
*   Curfews are in place from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.
*   Masks are required.
*   Violations range from $250 – $500.
*   The city will open extra hospital beds in a civic center and some patients are reportedly being airlifted to other locations to clear room in the hospitals
*   **Why It Matters:** While America is experiencing a surge in COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, El Paso serves as a microcosm of one city uniquely [impacted by a sudden increase](https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/health/2020/10/27/el-paso-covid-19-hospitalizations-near-900-fort-bliss-sets-curfew/3747326001/). Time will tell if it is a unique outlier or a canary in the coal mine for other cities.
