* Alaska is now the first state to allow those 16-and-older access to a COVID-19 vaccine.
* Most other states have provided vaccination access to seniors, and those with pre-existing conditions as well as front-line workers.
* The only vaccine with emergency use authorization for those as young as 16 is the Pfizer vaccine.
* Other vaccines like Moderna are testing the vaccine on those 12 and older. No studies are currently being conducted with those under the age of 12.
* Why This Matters: Some doctors believe that the only way America reaches a level of "community immunity" is to vaccine teenagers as well as adults.
