*   The [University of North Carolina](https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/) [announced](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/08/18/903682476/unc-experience-should-be-a-lesson-to-other-universities-says-faculty-chair?) its decision on Monday. One week after opening in-person classes on August 10, the COVID-19 positivity rate rose from 2.8% to 13.6%, causing the school to revert to remote instruction for the time being. On Tuesday, the [University of Notre Dame](https://news.nd.edu/news/notre-dame-enacts-two-weeks-of-remote-instruction/) also temporarily suspended in-person classes when more than 15% of those tested for COVID-19 received positive resultsÂ after a week of in-person classes.
*   Meanwhile, the [University of Connecticut](https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-uconn-quarantine-positive-tests-20200818-kjvaf6xmvngp5jatyxsbdl5gwa-story.html), has revoked online housing for some students who disregarded social distancing guidelines and held parties.
*   **BIG PICTURE:** To date, according to the [Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/heres-a-list-of-colleges-plans-for-reopening-in-the-fall/), over 30% of higher education institutions are conducting classes full or primarily online, and about 15% are employing an in-person / online hybrid.
