*   **THE LATEST:** AstraZeneca’s CEO [says](https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html) the “_vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against COVID-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency. Furthermore, the vaccine’s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval_.”
    *   Last week, Moderna announced the results of its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial show it’s nearly 95% effective.
        *   Also last week, the U.S. gov’t granted emergency use authorization for a first of its kind at-home COVID-19 test that provides results in 30 min. or less. So far, it’s catching 94% of all positive cases, and 98% of all negative cases.
    *   Two weeks ago, Pfizer announced the results of its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial show it’s over 90% effective. Pfizer became the first to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA last week.
*   **ABOUT THE ASTRAZENECA TRIALS:** The trials involve over 23,000 participants in the UK and Brazil. The vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca using a weakened version of the common cold virus.
    *   AstraZeneca says its vaccine is at least 62% effective (when given as a half dose followed by a full dose one month later) and up to 90% effective (when given as two full doses one month apart).
*   **FYI:** Unlike the other vaccines, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not need to be stored at ultra-cool temperatures, and it’s expected to be [less expensive](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-third-cheaper-oxford-c99d26eb2946f6fde45a1edc002ff028) than those from Pfizer and Moderna.
*   **BIG PICTURE:** Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week that he expects the U.S. will have [40 million](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4924104/40-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-end-year-secretary-azar) doses of vaccines available for high-risk and vulnerable populations, such as frontline workers, by the end of the year.
