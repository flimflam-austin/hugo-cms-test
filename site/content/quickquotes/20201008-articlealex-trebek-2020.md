*   Full quote: _“I guess I’ve accomplished what I wanted to. I’ve made people feel good. And I’m going to help a lot of good charities. I just want people to say, ‘He’s a good guy. Now I know why I like him.’”_ 
*   Trebek hosted Jeopardy! since its first show in 1984.
*   He holds the title for “most game shows hosted by the same presenter” (more than 8,000).
*   His broadcast [career started out of necessity](\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-trebek-dies-age-80-pancreatic-cancer-jeopardy/\"): “The only reason I got into broadcasting was, I needed money to pay for my junior and senior years at college, and they hired me, those fools!”
*   Trebek was married with three children. Read more about Trebek here from his obituary in the [LA Times](\"https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2020-11-08/alex-trebek-jeopardy-dead\"). _Here’s how the stars aligned: “In 1984, Merv Griffin decided to revive “Jeopardy!” and pair it with “Wheel of Fortune” in an early evening time slot. On the advice of Lucille Ball, Griffin asked Trebek to be the host. And on the advice of Griffin’s wife, the format of the show came with a twist — give the contestants the answer, and let them puzzle out the question. Some thought the idea sprang from the so-called quiz show scandals of the 1950s in which contestants were given answers or asked to throw the game.”_

*   BTW – Jeopardy! will continue to air until Christmas Day. What’s next? TBD.
