*   Current designated [State Sponsor of Terrorism](\"https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/\"): Iran, North Korea, Sudan.
*   Cuba was designated previously in 1982, and removed from the State Sponsor of Terrorism list in 2015.
*   Why It Matters: This designations allows further sanctions to counter a nation the U.S. believes is supporting terrorist groups or participating in acts of terror.
*   More from Sec. Pompeo and [full statement](\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-announces-designation-of-cuba-as-a-state-sponsor-of-terrorism/\"):_Today’s designation subjects Cuba to sanctions that penalize persons and countries engaging in certain trade with Cuba, restricts U.S. foreign assistance, bans defense exports and sales, and imposes certain controls on exports of dual use items._ _The United States will continue to support the Cuban people in their desire for a democratic government and respect for human rights, including freedom of religion, expression, and association.  Until these rights and freedoms are respected, we will continue to hold the regime accountable._
