*   Louisiana Congressman-elect Luke Letlow was married with two small children. According to Associated Press, he had no underlying health conditions.
*   He was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 on Dec. 19th and passed away on Dec. 29th. [The New York Post](https://nypost.com/2021/01/02/congressman-elect-luke-letlow-41-mourned-after-covid-19-death/) reported this on the circumstances of his passing: _Letlow, 41, died of COVID-19 complications Tuesday when he suffered a heart attack after undergoing an apparently successful operation to remove a blood clot. He had been hospitalized at Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport since Dec. 23 as he battled COVID-19._
*   Letlow’s seat will be filled through a special election on March 20.
*   According to the latest data at the beginning of January 2021: America has more than 20M cases of COVID-19 and more than 350,000 deaths.
*   **Why This Matters:** The tragic passing of the congressman does not change the political dynamics in the House of Representatives, but underscores the speed and unpredictability of the new coronavirus.

“It just, just, just, just brings home COVID can kill. For most folks it doesn’t, but it truly can. So, as you remember Luke, his widow, his children in your prayers, remember as well to be careful with COVID.” [_Republican U.S. Sen.
