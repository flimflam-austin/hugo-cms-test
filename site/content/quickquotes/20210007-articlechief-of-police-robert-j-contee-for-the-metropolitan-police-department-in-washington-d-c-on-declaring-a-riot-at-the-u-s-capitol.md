*   Chief Contee did not give an exact time for a declaration of a “riot” on January 6th, 2021 during the security breach at the U.S. Capitol – when those who began as protestors illegally entered federal property and violently confronted law enforcement.
*   MPD (Metropolitan Police Department) assisted Capitol Hill Police who were overwhelmed by those attempting to enter the Capitol. USCP (U.S. Capitol Police) have jurisdiction on this federal property.
*   MPD made 68 arrests and 56 officers were injured as of his tally by this news conference on January 7th.
*   A riot declaration is important as it enables police to use additional resources and force (example tear gas) to clear a crowd.
