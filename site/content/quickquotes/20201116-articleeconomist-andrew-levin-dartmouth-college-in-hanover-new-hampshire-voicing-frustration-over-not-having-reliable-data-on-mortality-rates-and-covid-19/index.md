*   The public and researchers want a gauge on how deadly COVID-19.
*   Doctors interviewed by science journal _Nature_ say they are getting better at treating COVID-19 and seeing the mortality rate go down in their hospitals.
*   However, a statistic on COVID-19 mortality remains illusive for several reasons – here’s an excerpt:
*   _Case-fatality rates depend on testing: a country that tests only people with severe symptoms, for example, will have an outsized case-fatality rate compared with one in which asymptomatic testing is widespread. And fatality rates in intensive-care units can mislead if the demographics of the people admitted change over time. For example, many hospitals reported high numbers of younger patients as the pandemic wore on…As a result, it has taken researchers some time to determine whether the number of deaths per SARS-CoV-2 infection is really falling, particularly for older people, says epidemiologist Ali Mokdad at the University of Washington in Seattle. Mokdad and his colleagues have been monitoring global data, with a focus on the United States and Europe. A provisional analysis, he says, which includes data from the American Hospital Association, now suggests that the number of fatalities per infection might have fallen by 20%._
*   Why This Matters: Understanding how deadly COVID-19 really is to different members of a community will not only help treatment but public policy.
