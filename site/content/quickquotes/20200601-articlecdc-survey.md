*   The CDC conducted phone interviews with a random selection of 350 people with COVID-19 (both inpatient and outpatient) from nine states.
*   Participants were asked about their interactions with others, specifically if they came within 6 feet of a person diagnosed with COVID-19 during the two weeks leading up to their disease onset or test date (for asymptomatic patients).
*   WHY IT MATTERS: The study illustrates the extent of asymptomatic spread and, according to the study’s researchers, the “_need for increased **screening, case investigation, contact tracing, and isolation** of infected persons during periods of community transmission_” and “_suggests that ensuring **social distancing** and more widespread use of cloth **face coverings** are warranted.”_
*   Researchers also noted that the study has limits – namely that participants were not representative of cases nationwide because they were all affiliated with academic medical centers and their self-reported results were telephone-based.
