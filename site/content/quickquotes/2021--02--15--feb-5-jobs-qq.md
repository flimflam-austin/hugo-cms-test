    summary: Corporate economist Robert Frick, Navy Federal Credit Union, on

    * Frick went on to say: "We especially shouldn't take solace that the
    unemployments rate fell dramatically given that't manly because more Americans
    dropped out of the labor force."

    * The unemployment rate fell because fewer people are actively looking for a job - a small labor force is not an indication of a healthy job market. Ideally, a "healthy" labor market has high labor market participation and a lower unemployment rate because people have jobs. 

    * The economy added jobs - a reversal from the previous month recording job losses. 

    * **Why it Matters:** The economy remains "down" 10 million jobs since March/April last year when America effectively "shut down" to stop the spread of the coronavirys. Questions remains about how best to recover these jobs (economic stimulus? a changing economy?) and how that impacts the health of the U.S. economy overall.
