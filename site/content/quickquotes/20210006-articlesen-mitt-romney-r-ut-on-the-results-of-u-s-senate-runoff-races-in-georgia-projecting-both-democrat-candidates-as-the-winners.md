*   Democrat **Rev. Raphael Warnock** who faced off against Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler is the projected winner. The race has not been called officially by GA election officials. Warnock would be the first black senator in Georgia’s history.
*   Democrat **Jon Ossoff** who faced off against Sen. David Perdue (R), is the projected winner. The race has not been called officially by GA election officials. Ossoff would be the first Jewish senator in Georgia’s history.
*   **FYI:** It might NOT be over yet. Georgia law allows recounts if two candidates are within a 0.5 percentage points.
*   **BIG PICTURE:** The outcomes of the U.S. Senate races in Georgia will determine which party controls the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate 50 to 48. Democrats need both Ossoff  \*and\* Warnock to win to get to a 50-50 split, which effectively gives Democrats control of the Senate because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
