*   Here’s President Trump’s [full answer](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-air-force-one-departure-joint-base-andrews-md-011221/):

_Q Mr. President, what is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is your personal responsibility?_

_THE PRESIDENT: So if you read my speech — and many people have done it, and I’ve seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television — it’s been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate._

_And if you look at what other people have said — politicians at a high level — about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle, in various other — other places, that was a real problem — what they said._

_But they’ve analyzed my speech and words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody, to the T, thought it was totally appropriate._

_Okay, thank you. Thank you._

*   In Texas, President Trump  made his most pointed comments this week on the Capitol Hill riot – nearly one week after the event.
*   **FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:** Here is President Trump’s address during the Washington D.C. rally January 6th, 2021. After his speech, protestors marched to Capitol Hill and the D.C. Metropolitan Police later declared a riot after the protestors breached the Capitol: [WATCH THE SPEECH HERE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/annotated-trump-speech-jan-6-capitol/) and read analysis by _The Washington Post_ on certain excerpts of the speech. [The speech is one of the reasons House Democrats moved to consider an article of impeachment on “Incitement of Insurrection”](https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-effort-live-updates/2021/01/11/955631105/impeachment-resolution-cites-trumps-incitement-of-capitol-insurrection) exactly one week after the event.
