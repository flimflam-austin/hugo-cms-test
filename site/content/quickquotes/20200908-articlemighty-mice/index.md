    so-called “mighty mice” to study muscle and bone loss in space. The study’s
    results may have far-reaching impact here on Earth.

*   40 mice participated in the study, and traveled to the International Space Station on the SpaceX rocket in December. They returned to Earth in January.
*   Some of the mice were genetically modified –  As the [Associated Press describes](https://apnews.com/12dda166796549a4b64f4e0321d531de): “The treatment involves blocking a pair of proteins that typically limit muscle mass.”
*   The genetically modified mice returned to Earth with bigger muscles than the others.
*   The researchers also administered the treatment to some mice upon landing; those mice also built muscle mass.
*   Why It Matters: A major challenge for humans and space travel is loss of muscle mass. Astronauts exercise up to 2 hours a day to prevent the effects. Muscle loss is also a challenge for anyone suffering from a disease that leaves them bedridden, or someone who is paralyzed. The researchers [said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/07/world/mighty-mice-space-station-study-scn-wellness-trnd/index.html): _“Our hope is that this could be used both for astronauts during extended space travel and for people on Earth suffering from muscle and bone loss. There is still a lot of work that would need to be done in this regard, but we believe that this type of strategy holds promise.”_[‘Mighty mice’ stay musclebound in space, boon for astronauts](https://apnews.com/12dda166796549a4b64f4e0321d531de)Here’s some background on the study and the researchers: [Rodents and a rocket carried these researchers’ dreams to space](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/rodents-and-a-rocket-carried-researchers-dreams-into-space-rodent-research-19)
