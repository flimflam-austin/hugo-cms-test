      # NEW NAME


      ## “COVID-19”


      The World Health Organization chose this name to specifically refer to
      this newly discovered coronavirus (COVI) disease (D) in 2019 (19).


      Purposefully doesn’t refer to place of origin to avoid “stigma” – e.g.
      “Wuhan Coronavirus.”

      ## NEW CASES


      > “In 2% of reported #COVID19 cases, the virus is fatal & the risk of
      death increases the older you are. We see relatively few cases among
      children. More research is needed to understand why.”  
        
      Dir-Gen of World Health Organization Dr. Tedros as the number of those
      infected Monday rose to 71,000+. Current WHO data says about 80% of the
      people who get COVID-19 will have a mild case and recover.

      ## New Economic Contagion


      > “…we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance…”  
        
      Apple, issuing guidance on its earnings, as the new coronavirus impacts
      its production and sales. America's largest company is one of the first to
      officially address the impact of the illness, raising questions about
      further economic ripple effects in Asia, Europe and beyond.

      ## NEW QUARANTINES


      * U.S. evacuated citizens from a quarantined cruise ship docked in Japan
      as it became apparent the virus continued to spread.

      * 300+ must be quarantined, with at least 14 testing positive for the
      virus.

      * Upwards of 15 military bases can host quarantines, a handful have done
      so ex: Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in TX.

      * Quarantine applies to those infected and healthy; lasts 14 days.

      > “The potential is there…Whether we will get there or not, we don’t know.
      I’m holding my breath and crossing my fingers.”  
        
      Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt
      University's School of Medicine responding to a question about whether or
      not a global pandemic (a worldwide epidemic) is possible. He says despite
      best efforts, the data from China where the disease originated "still is
      very confusing, and we have to be skeptical."

      The mystery remains on how this virus is spreading. With most infections
      coming from China, can it travel on Chinese-made goods? With no single
      answer, a doctor from UCSF explain the risks in an article on our source
      page.

**Here’s how long coronaviruses may linger on contaminated surfaces, according to science**  
[https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/17/health/novel-coronavirus-surfaces-study/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/17/health/novel-coronavirus-surfaces-study/index.html)

_The new research involved analyzing 22 previously published studies on coronaviruses, which researchers hope can help provide insight into the novel coronavirus._

_“Based on the current available data, I would primarily rely on the data from SARS coronavirus, which is the closest relative to the novel coronavirus — with 80% sequence similarity — among the coronaviruses tested. For SARS coronavirus, the range of persistence on surfaces was less than five minutes to nine days,” said Dr. Charles Chiu, an infectious disease professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and director of the USCF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, who was not involved in the new study._

_“However, it is very difficult to extrapolate these findings to the novel coronavirus due to the different strains, viral titers and environmental conditions that were tested in the various studies and the lack of data on the novel coronavirus itself,” he said. “More research using cultures of the novel coronavirus are needed to establish the duration that it can survive on surfaces.”_

_The CDC has noted that coronaviruses are thought to spread most often by respiratory droplets, such as droplets in a cough or sneeze, and coronaviruses in general have “poor survivability” on surfaces — but there is still much to learn about the novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19._

_“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,” according to the CDC’s website._
