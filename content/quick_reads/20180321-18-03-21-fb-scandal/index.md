      ## What’s The Big Deal?


      * Cambridge Analytica reportedly gave **U.S. political strategy work** to
      a British partner firm, owned by a Brit & run by Europeans. **It’s illegal
      for foreigners to interfere in U.S. elections.**

      * Some FB users willingly gave data to the professor app that then gave to
      Cambridge Analytica; others did not. Debatable about what’s illegal versus
      unethical.
