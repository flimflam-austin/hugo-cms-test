      Actress Cicely Tyson won Emmys, a Tony and an honorary Oscar for her
      acting work over the course of 7 decades, becoming one of the leading,
      trailblazing black actresses in Hollywood. She died only days after the
      release of her memoir at the age of 96. Responding to a question once
      about advice for the young, Tyson responded: “It’s simple. I try always to
      be true to myself."
