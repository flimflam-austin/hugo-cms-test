      ## MOLLY SEIDEL


      The 25-year-old ran into the history books Saturday as the first-ever
      American woman to qualify for the U.S Olympic marathon team by racing in
      her very first marathon.


      The part-time barista & babysitter overcame injuries and an eating
      disorder to return to competition after a decorated college running
      career.

      Seidel qualified to represent the U.S. in the 2020 Summer Olympics by
      running the 26.2 mile course in about 2 hours and 27 minutes - or an
      average of under-6-minute miles. She previously said a 10-20th ranking
      during the marathon would be a “good day,” calling the qualifying race a
      “moonshot." She finished 2nd.
