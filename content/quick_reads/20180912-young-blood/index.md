      ## Tech’s “Death Disruption”


      * **Next Big Thing?** Silicon Valley start-ups currently investing
      millions on the use of young blood to heal, or even reverse, signs of
      aging like memory loss.

      * **How It Works:** Blood transfusions from a young person to an older
      person.

      * Most promising research done on mice, not conclusive for humans.

      ## Why It Matters: Panacea?


      > _‘Instead of taking a drug for your heart and a drug for your muscles
      and a drug for your brain, maybe you could come up with something that
      affected them all.”_  
        
        
        
      Dr. Amy Wagers, Harvard professor, who showed the blood of young mice
      rejuvenates the hearts of old mice. Some experts believe young blood may
      treat Alzheimer’s & heart disease.

      ## Something To Consider:


      **Side Effects:** Some believe young blood may cause cells to multiply
      uncontrollably (how cancer starts).


      **Unknowns**:**Cost, dosage, frequency** and**quality control**. One U.S.
      clinical trial offered teenage blood to elderly at $8K/treatment, but with
      no peer review or control study, some questioned company’s proclaimed
      positive results.

      Young blood research focuses on the internal - it won't erase wrinkles.
      But "vampire facials" use the same blood therapy often used by athletes to
      repair muscles in an attempt to reverse the signs of aging. Is this the
      next logical step in the anti-aging industry?
