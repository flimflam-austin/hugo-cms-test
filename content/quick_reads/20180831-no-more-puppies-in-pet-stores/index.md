      sales of puppies &amp; kittens younger than 6 months old by anyone EXCEPT
      breeders.</li><li><strong>Why</strong>:A Crackdown on puppy mills &amp;
      poor treatment of animals.</li><li><strong>Interesting</strong>: England
      doesn’t track puppy sales – no clear idea of how many puppies are actually
      being sold through pet stores; estimates upwards of
      80,000.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The Benefit Of A Ban</h2><blockquote><em>“</em>(Bans) protect
      consumers who may unwittingly purchase sometimes sick or genetically
      compromised puppy mill puppies from pet stores. They promote the
      acquisition of shelter/rescue dogs instead of commercially bred dogs ….
      Nationally, they pressure the commercial pet industry to clean up its
      act.”<br><br><br><br>Humane Society</blockquote></div>
