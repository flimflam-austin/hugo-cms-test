      > ‘We can spare thousands and thousands of women from getting toxic
      treatment that really wouldn’t benefit them. **This is very powerful. It
      really changes the standard of care**.’  
        
        
        
      Dr. Ingrid A. Mayer, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, an author of
      the study that started in 2006 and included more than 10,000 women.

      ## Basics of Study


      * Focus: early stage tumors (before cancer has chance to spread).

      * Doctors use a genetic test to predict cancer reoccurrence – results
      determine treatment.

      * Mid-range readings often got recommended chemo & hormone therapy; study
      focused on this group and now challenges the use of chemo.

      * **70%: NO benefit from chemo.**

      ## Something To Consider:


      * **Affirmation**: Breast cancer study from 2016 found little difference
      in outcome between patients treated with chemo vs. those without; genetic
      testing on tumor also used to determine treatment.

      * **One caveat:**A Women under 50 with breast cancer *may* benefit from
      chemo, but **docs don’t know why.**

      Some suggest this isn't a move away from simply chemo; but a move toward
      more personalized medicine. The WSJ points out this is part of a trend in
      cancer treatment - that has doctors leaning towards (and proving) less
      invasive care is healthier and less costly.
