      > “The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond
      description; absolutely unparalleled throughout the wide world.”


      Pres. Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 after visiting the Grand Canyon. Years
      earlier, Sen. Harrison (who later became president) proposed legislation
      to protect the Grand Canyon, but repeated congressional action failed. One
      of the challenges? Few lawmakers had seen the site to understand its
      importance.

      Congress approved the measure.

      * **1908:** Pres. Roosevelt made the Grand Canyon a national monument.

      * **1919:** After congressional action, Pres. Wilson declared the Grand
      Canyon America’s 15th national park – three yrs after creating the
      National Park Service.

      Pres. Roosevelt underscored this point about Grand Canyon: "You cannot
      improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your
      children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight
      which every American should see." More than 5M people visit the national
      park every year.
