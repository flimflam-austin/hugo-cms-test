* **Veterans with PTSD treated with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation**  
_As part of its mission to promote new treatment options for Veterans, the VA Center for Compassionate Care Innovation (CCI) supported the expanded use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment at theA Providence VA Medical CenterA in Rhode Island. As seen pictured aboveA Dr. Noah Philip, Director of Psychiatric Neuromodulation at Providence VA, treats a patient using TMS therapy.TMS treatments are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat depression. An electromagnet, essentially a wire wrapped around a solid coil, is charged with electricity and then placed over specific points on the skull.A This creates a very powerful magnetic field that can positively affect brain cells. While TMS is typically used to treat depression, there is growing evidence that it can help Veterans with PTSD._
