      <div><h2>BACKSTORY</h2><ul><li><strong>2010:</strong> ACA signed into
      law.</li><li><strong>2012:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA’s
      “individual mandate” (requires most Americans buy insurance or pay
      penalty) under Congress’ tax powers, declaring the ACA
      constitutional.</li><li><strong>2018:</strong> After Congress eliminated
      the tax penalty under the GOP’s 2017 tax overhaul, a TX federal judge
      ruled the ACA can’t stand w/o the tax penalty. This ruling is on
      hold.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>THE CASE</h2><ul><li>The Court will decide if the individual
      mandate is unconstitutional and if Congress’ 2017 elimination of the tax
      penalty means the entire ACA is invalid.</li><li><strong>18 states led by
      TX</strong> (&amp; backed by Trump admin) argue the mandate is central to
      the ACA, and w/o the penalty the ACA is
      unconstitutional.</li><li><strong>20 states + DC led by CA</strong> argue
      the mandate can be separated from the ACA so the law can still
      stand.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>2012 vs. 2020</h2><ul><li>None of Pres. Trump appointees (Neil
      Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett) were members of the Court
      when it ruled on the ACA previously.</li><li>The Court now has a
      <strong>6-3 majority of Republican-appointed
      justices</strong>.</li><li>Some question if Justice Barrett’s 2017
      critique of Chief Justice John Roberts’ 2012 opinion upholding the law
      means she will vote to strike it down, but she’s said she is “not hostile
      to the ACA.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2><ul><li><strong>Big Picture:</strong> The
      quality, cost &amp; availability of healthcare in America remains a hotly
      debated issue.</li><li><strong>Timing:</strong> The fate of the ACA is
      being examined smack in the middle of a global pandemic with unique
      challenges.</li><li><strong>Unknowns:</strong> While debates continue over
      the value of the law, roughly 17.5M more Americans have insurance now vs.
      before the ACA.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>WHAT’S NEXT</h2><p>We won’t know the results of the case until
      next spring, and as late as June 2021.</p><p>If the law is struck down,
      the ripple effects are truly TBD.</p><p>If the law is upheld, there’s
      still a possibility of legislative changes as Democrats discuss adding a
      public option, and Republicans have promised to create a separate
      plan.</p></div>

      <div><p>The incoming Congress could take actions (ex: eliminating the
      individual mandate or increasing the tax penalty to a nominal amount)
      which would influence how the Court ultimately rules. This is one of the
      reasons why the future of the Senate, with two tie-breaking seats in
      Georgia in a runoff for Senate party majority, matter so
      much.</p><p></p></div>
