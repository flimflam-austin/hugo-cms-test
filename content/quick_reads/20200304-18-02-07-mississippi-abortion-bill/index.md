      ## What Does MS Bill Say?


      * Prohibits abortion after 15 weeks.

      * Abortion only allowed if health of mother is in danger or baby will not
      survive outside the womb after full-term.

      * Rape or incest NOT exceptions.

      * Mississippi is 1 of 17 states that doesn’t allow abortions after 20 wks.
      The 15 week “mark” is unprecedented.

      Why Is This Significant


      **Supreme Court Showdown In The Making**  



      * Roe V. Wade legalized abortion, but held a woman’s right to an abortion
      is **not absolute**.

      * States may restrict or ban abortions when a baby can survive outside
      womb (aka legally as “fetal viability”).

      The 15 week mark in Mississippi is why this law is controversial and
      challenges "norms" on when a child can survive outside womb. That medical
      debate has legal implications.
