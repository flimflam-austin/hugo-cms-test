      single day decline in stock prices</strong> since the 2008 financial
      crisis; <strong>stocks entered “bear market”

      <div><h2>OIL PRICES</h2><ul><li>Notable This Week: <strong>Largest decline
      in oil prices in more than 25 years.</strong></li><li>Why Prices Dropped:
      Oil fuels the global economy; slower economic growth due to COVID-19 fears
      *could* lead to lower demand &amp; lower prices.</li><li>ALSO: Saudi
      Arabia wanted to cut oil production along w/other oil producers to raise
      falling prices (less supply = higher prices); Russia disagreed. A price
      war has ensued, driving prices lower.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why Oil Prices Matter:</h2><blockquote>“If these prices go on for
      too long, there will be a lot of bankruptcies. You need at least $40 a
      barrel to break even for production in the United States and most won’t be
      making money at those prices.”<br><br>Oil analyst Jack Allardyce, Cantor
      Fitzgerald Europe. Oil prices fluctuate but recently dropped as low as $30
      a barrel. While lower oil prices may lead to lower gas prices, they can
      also lead to job losses.</blockquote></div>

      <div><p>“What we have now is really two epidemics. We have an epidemic of
      the coronavirus, but we also have an epidemic of fear based around a
      narrative that is not necessarily keeping up with scientific reality. And,
      this narrative has been quite striking. It’s a dangerous time for the
      stock market.”</p><p>Robert Shiller, Yale professor and Nobel Prize
      winner</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We are going to take care of and have been taking care
      of the American public and the American economy.”</blockquote><p>Pres.
      Trump says the White House will work towards providing some tax cuts and
      economic support for industries impacted. Expectations of these programs
      helped steady stocks temporarily, but a reminder - the House of
      Representatives has the “power of the purse” to tax and legislate economic
      policy. Details are TBD.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“A global recession is more likely than
      not.”<br><br>Economist Mark Zandi who says nervous consumers pulling back
      spending may lead to an economic recession. The health of the American
      consumer remains a major focus for health officials, investors, and
      economists alike. The American consumer drives two-thirds of the world's
      largest economy with their spending; any change in their habits can
      trigger a change for better or worse.</blockquote><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>Reminder: Recessions, or periods of when the economy contracts
      rather than grows, can vary in severity and length of time. Over the last
      100 years, recessions ranged from several years during the Great
      Depression to a period of 6 months.</p><p></p></div>
