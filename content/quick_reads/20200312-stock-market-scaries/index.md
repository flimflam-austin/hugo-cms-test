      ## STOCK MARKET


      * Notable This Week:**largest single day decline in stock prices** since
      the 2008 financial crisis;**stocks entered “bear market” territory.**

      * Why Stocks Dropped: Uncertainty, fear over the impact of COVID-19 on
      global growth, consumer habits.

      * Bear market = stock prices fall more than 20%. This “down market” can
      last days, weeks, months, or years. A “bull market” references rising
      stock prices.

      ## OIL PRICES


      * Notable This Week:**Largest decline in oil prices in more than 25
      years.**

      * Why Prices Dropped: Oil fuels the global economy; slower economic growth
      due to COVID-19 fears *could* lead to lower demand & lower prices.

      * ALSO: Saudi Arabia wanted to cut oil production along w/other oil
      producers to raise falling prices (less supply = higher prices); Russia
      disagreed. A price war has ensued, driving prices lower.

      ## Why Oil Prices Matter:


      > “If these prices go on for too long, there will be a lot of
      bankruptcies. You need at least $40 a barrel to break even for production
      in the United States and most won’t be making money at those prices.”  
        
      Oil analyst Jack Allardyce, Cantor Fitzgerald Europe. Oil prices fluctuate
      but recently dropped as low as $30 a barrel. While lower oil prices may
      lead to lower gas prices, they can also lead to job losses.

      “What we have now is really two epidemics. We have an epidemic of the
      coronavirus, but we also have an epidemic of fear based around a narrative
      that is not necessarily keeping up with scientific reality. And, this
      narrative has been quite striking. It’s a dangerous time for the stock
      market.”

      > “We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American
      public and the American economy.”


      Pres. Trump says the White House will work towards providing some tax cuts
      and economic support for industries impacted. Expectations of these
      programs helped steady stocks temporarily, but a reminder - the House of
      Representatives has the “power of the purse” to tax and legislate economic
      policy. Details are TBD.

      > “A global recession is more likely than not.”  
        
      Economist Mark Zandi who says nervous consumers pulling back spending may
      lead to an economic recession. The health of the American consumer remains
      a major focus for health officials, investors, and economists alike. The
      American consumer drives two-thirds of the world's largest economy with
      their spending; any change in their habits can trigger a change for better
      or worse.

      Reminder: Recessions, or periods of when the economy contracts rather than
      grows, can vary in severity and length of time. Over the last 100 years,
      recessions ranged from several years during the Great Depression to a
      period of 6 months.
