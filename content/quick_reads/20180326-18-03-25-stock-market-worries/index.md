      Will the Hits  

      Keep on Coming?


      Most analysts still consider this a “normal correction” – not a “bear
      market” with continued selling.


      However, the losses are unsettling after a really strong 2017, the 1st
      year in history where the S&P 500 showed gains EVERY month.


      So Now What?
