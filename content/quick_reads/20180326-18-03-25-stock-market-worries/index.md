* Treasury Secretary Mnuchin: Trump will impose China tariffs, not worried about recent market losses: [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/25/mnuchin-trump-will-impose-china-tariffs-not-worried-about-recent-market-losses.html](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/25/mnuchin-trump-will-impose-china-tariffs-not-worried-about-recent-market-losses.html)

> _We are going to proceed with our tariffs. We”re working on that, Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday in an exclusive interview, while acknowledging the U.S. is also trying to reach a trade deal with China in which the country would reduce tariffs and further open its markets._  
  
  
  
_As the president has said, we want to cut the trade deficit $100 billion over the next year. a| I”m cautiously hopeful we reach an agreement, but if not we are proceeding with these tariffs. We are not putting them on hold._  
  
  
  
_There”s a lot of different things impacting the stock market, but I think the most important thing to focus on is the market will go up and down in the short-term, the real important issue is where will it be longer-term. And the market is still up an enormous amount since the since the election, Mnuchin said._
