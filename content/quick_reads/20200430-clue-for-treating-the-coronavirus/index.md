      <div><h2>What To Know:</h2><p>Nat’l Inst. of Health’s Dr. Fauci shared the
      results today of “the first truly high-powered randomized placebo control
      trial” on a drug used to treat COVID-19.</p><ul><li>Drug: remdesivir
      (rem-des-a-veer)</li><li>NIH sponsored the trial that began in February
      and included 1,000+ hospitalized patients across the
      globe</li><li><strong>Reduced recovery time of patients from 15 days to 11
      days, or roughly 30%</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><p>There are no *proven* therapeutics to
      specifically treat COVID-19.</p><p>Dr. Fauci: “<strong>What it’s proven is
      that a drug can block this virus…We think it’s really opening the door to
      the fact that we now have the capability of treating.”</strong></p><p>This
      will encourage further research, testing, and innovation on remdesivir and
      other therapeutics.</p></div>

      <div><h2>How It Works:</h2><p>Remdesivir blocks an enzyme used by the
      virus to gain strength or replicate.</p><p>Administered through an
      IV.</p><p><strong>Interesting to Note</strong>: Though tested for treating
      SARS &amp; MERS (coronaviruses), leading to positive results for
      shortening disease and symptoms in animals, remdesivir has NOT been
      approved anywhere in the world.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“It’s active against every coronavirus that we’ve ever
      tested. It was very hard for the virus to develop resistance to
      remdesivir. That means the drug would likely be effective over longer term
      use.”</blockquote><p>Vanderbilt University’s Dr. Mark Denison who has
      studied the drug's impact on different coronaviruses dating back to 2013.
      Additional information is needed about its use on COVID-19, including
      whether or not it can be safe &amp; effective treating less severe cases
      of COVID-19.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><p>In a separate study on remdesivir in
      China, the drug did not lead to shorter recovery times. Patients receiving
      the drug vs. placebo did not experience any significant benefit.</p><p>The
      study was smaller and ended early. Researchers wanted more than 450 people
      enrolled, but ended up with just over half of that, due to decreasing
      number of COVID cases.</p></div>

      <div><p>Dr. Fauci says the drug's impact on COVID-19 mortality is TBD.
      Initial data reflects a trend that those treated with remdesivir have
      lower mortality rates but a lot more information is needed. That said, the
      FDA says its already working with the drug-maker to secure availability of
      the treatment *if* approved.</p><p></p></div>
