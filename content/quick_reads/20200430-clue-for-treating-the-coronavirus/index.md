      ## “HIGHLY POWERED”


      ## The results of a drug trial provide an important clue to treating
      COVID-19.

      ## What To Know:


      Nat’l Inst. of Health’s Dr. Fauci shared the results today of “the first
      truly high-powered randomized placebo control trial” on a drug used to
      treat COVID-19.


      * Drug: remdesivir (rem-des-a-veer)

      * NIH sponsored the trial that began in February and included 1,000+
      hospitalized patients across the globe

      * **Reduced recovery time of patients from 15 days to 11 days, or roughly
      30%**

      ## Why It Matters:


      There are no *proven* therapeutics to specifically treat COVID-19.


      Dr. Fauci: “**What it’s proven is that a drug can block this virus…We
      think it’s really opening the door to the fact that we now have the
      capability of treating.”**


      This will encourage further research, testing, and innovation on
      remdesivir and other therapeutics.

      ## How It Works:


      Remdesivir blocks an enzyme used by the virus to gain strength or
      replicate.


      Administered through an IV.


      **Interesting to Note**: Though tested for treating SARS & MERS
      (coronaviruses), leading to positive results for shortening disease and
      symptoms in animals, remdesivir has NOT been approved anywhere in the
      world.

      > “It’s active against every coronavirus that we’ve ever tested. It was
      very hard for the virus to develop resistance to remdesivir. That means
      the drug would likely be effective over longer term use.”


      Vanderbilt University’s Dr. Mark Denison who has studied the drug's impact
      on different coronaviruses dating back to 2013. Additional information is
      needed about its use on COVID-19, including whether or not it can be safe
      & effective treating less severe cases of COVID-19.

      ## Something To Consider


      In a separate study on remdesivir in China, the drug did not lead to
      shorter recovery times. Patients receiving the drug vs. placebo did not
      experience any significant benefit.


      The study was smaller and ended early. Researchers wanted more than 450
      people enrolled, but ended up with just over half of that, due to
      decreasing number of COVID cases.

      Dr. Fauci says the drug's impact on COVID-19 mortality is TBD. Initial
      data reflects a trend that those treated with remdesivir have lower
      mortality rates but a lot more information is needed. That said, the FDA
      says its already working with the drug-maker to secure availability of the
      treatment *if* approved.
