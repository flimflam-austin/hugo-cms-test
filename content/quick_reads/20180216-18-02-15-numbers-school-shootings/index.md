      school grounds “undermines the sense of security’ of

      <div><h2>Washington Post Argues:</h2><p><em>“The figures matter because
      gun-control activists use them as evidence in their fight for bans on
      assault weapons, stricter background checks and other legislation. Gun
      rights groups seize on the faults in the data to undermine those arguments
      and, similarly, present skewed figures of their own.”</em></p><p><a

      <div><h2>Others Agree</h2><p>“…this play on gun-control emotions is
      particularly troublesome because it takes the spotlight off of what is
      really worrisome. In this case, the shooter was well known to the school,
      known to the FBI, and known to many others as a deranged person with a
      serious violent streak.So why isn’t the focus of the public debate on what
      went wrong?” <em>Investors Business Daily</em></p></div>

* **No, there haven”t been 18 school shootings in 2018.

* **No, There Haven’t Been 18 School Shootings This Year — Not Even Close:** _In fact, of the 18 “school shootings,”A only five occurred during school hours, and only four — including the latest — are what most people would consider a school shooting; in which someone brings a gun to school with the intent of shooting students.A_ _Of those three previous shootings, only one resulted in deaths, when a 15-year-old boy armed with a handgun opened fire inside a Kentucky high school and killed two fellow students while injuring 14 others. The two others resulted in two injuries.A This is by no means meant to downplay the seriousness of this issue. These are all terrible tragedies, and parents have the right to expect that their children are safe at school._A [https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/no-there-havent-been-18-school-shootings-this-year-not-even-close/](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/no-there-havent-been-18-school-shootings-this-year-not-even-close/)
