      <div><h2>Why is FB Being Sued?</h2><ul><li>Facebook offers companies ways
      to advertise or “target” certain people by age, gender,
      etc.</li><li>Housing groups suing say this FB feature allows “landlords
      and real estate brokers to exclude families with children, women, and
      other protected classes of people from receiving housing
      ads.’</li><li><strong>Bottom Line: FB is accused of enabling housing
      discrimination.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Like Facebook, Google plans to build a community too. So have many
      other great American companies in the past. Does the social media
      component of the tech companies heighten the "creep factor" of these
      communities? You decide.</p><p><a
