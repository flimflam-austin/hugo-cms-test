      WHY?  

      Administrative Pressure


      In 2016, Harvard said it would prevent Class of 2021 members of
      single-gender groups from holding student leadership roles, receiving
      endorsements for fellowships, & becoming varsity captains.


      Accordingly, Alpha Phi, Harvard’s last remaining Greek sorority, has
      become the co-ed group, "**The Ivy**.”

New sanctions put in place by Harvard University placed our members in an untenable conflict a\x13 to choose between their supportive, empowering women-only space and external scholastic and leadership opportunities.”  \n  \n  \nRenee Zainer, Alpha Phi International President and Chairman of the International Executive Board"

      # What About The Guys?


      9 male-only groups, including 3 fraternities, remain. 4 formerly male-only
      groups are now coed.


      The more established history of Harvard’s male-only organizations (and
      their powerful alumni) are believed by some to carry more weight in
      resisting the sanctions, according to the Harvard Crimson.

      # BIGGER PICTURE


      ## Participation in ‘Greek Life’ declining overall.


      * **Alcohol-related** and/or**hazing-related violence** may deter
      membership; certain universities have simply suspended their “Greek Life”
      programs.

      * Others say a push toward**gender inclusivity** is the cause.

      Harvard isn't alone. Recently, Wesleyan University and Trinity College
      mandated their fraternities & sororities be co-ed. Trinity's mandate
      lasted 3 years. Wesleyan's was also short-lived after a fraternity sued
      the school over it and won.
