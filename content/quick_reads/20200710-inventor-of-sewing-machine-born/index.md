      * Born in Massachusetts.

      * He created the concept while working in a machinist shop; demonstrated &
      patented the sewing machine in 1846 but**he couldn’t gain momentum**.

      * Howe traveled to England to promote his invention to no avail.

      * Meanwhile, several U.S. companies started making sewing machines.

      * Howe, near broke, sued for illegal use of his patent and won.

      innovations that transformed the nature of work over the course of the
      nineteenth century…By 1900, most Americans employed in manufacturing no
      longer worked at home with their hands but in centralized factories with
      powered machinery.”_
