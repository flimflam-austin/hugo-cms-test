      <div><p></p><blockquote>“If we have learned one thing from the science of
      gratitude … [it] is that there is no resilience without gratitude. It’s
      impossible. Gratitude is absolutely indispensable for growing an
      unshakable core of calm, strength, and happiness.”<br><br>Prof. Robert
      Emmons, PhD, of University of California, Davis -- a research leader in
      the study of gratitude. He says the physical benefits of "the practice of
      gratitude" incl. lower blood pressure and a better-functioning immune
      system.</blockquote></div>

      lists</strong> for 2 weeks (5 items daily) reported increases in
      “happiness and life satisfaction” &amp; decreases in
      depression.</li><li>Those in therapy who wrote <strong>letters “expressing
      gratitude to others”</strong> reported improved mental health vs. those
      journaling about stressful events.</li><li>Those expressing gratitude
      showed higher brain activity in an area linked to “social bonding &amp;
      stress relief.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We found that more gratitude in these patients was
      associated with better mood, better sleep, less fatigue and lower levels
      of inflammatory biomarkers related to cardiac
      health.”</blockquote><p>Prof. Paul Mills, PhD, University of California,
      San Diego studied patients with asymptomatic heart failure. Those patients
      who scored higher in gratitude *also* scored higher in mood, sleep and
      heart health; "a more grateful heart is indeed a more healthy
      heart."</p></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><ul><li>One recent study used “thank
      you” notes, comparing how the writer felt about expressing “thanks” to how
      the receiver felt receiving it.</li><li>“Thank you” card writers
      “<strong>overestimated</strong> how awkward recipients would feel and
      <strong>underestimated</strong> how positive recipients would
      feel.”</li><li>Conclusion: Our biases may keep us from the benefits of
      sharing gratitude.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>We highlighted several points of research and linked to them on
      our source page. In many cases, scientists point out the challenges to
      studying and measuring gratitude (how can you measure your true
      gratefulness?) but the conclusions they reach are sure to spark
      conversation -- or even a little "thanks."</p><p></p></div>
