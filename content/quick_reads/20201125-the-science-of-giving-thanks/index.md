      > “If we have learned one thing from the science of gratitude … [it] is
      that there is no resilience without gratitude. It’s impossible. Gratitude
      is absolutely indispensable for growing an unshakable core of calm,
      strength, and happiness.”  
        
      Prof. Robert Emmons, PhD, of University of California, Davis -- a research
      leader in the study of gratitude. He says the physical benefits of "the
      practice of gratitude" incl. lower blood pressure and a better-functioning
      immune system.

      ## Studying Gratitude


      * Scientists have studied the benefits of gratitude for those who give
      thanks, those who receive thanks, and even those who *observe* thanks.

      * Wide-ranging research shows gratitude can improve our overall
      well-being, from mind to body.

      * UC Berkeley’s “Greater Good Science Center” has a special project
      dedicated specifically to gratitude research.

      ## What Studies Say:


      * Those who wrote**gratitude lists** for 2 weeks (5 items daily) reported
      increases in “happiness and life satisfaction” & decreases in depression.

      * Those in therapy who wrote**letters “expressing gratitude to others”**
      reported improved mental health vs. those journaling about stressful
      events.

      * Those expressing gratitude showed higher brain activity in an area
      linked to “social bonding & stress relief.”

      > “We found that more gratitude in these patients was associated with
      better mood, better sleep, less fatigue and lower levels of inflammatory
      biomarkers related to cardiac health.”


      Prof. Paul Mills, PhD, University of California, San Diego studied
      patients with asymptomatic heart failure. Those patients who scored higher
      in gratitude *also* scored higher in mood, sleep and heart health; "a more
      grateful heart is indeed a more healthy heart."

      ## Something To Consider


      * One recent study used “thank you” notes, comparing how the writer felt
      about expressing “thanks” to how the receiver felt receiving it.

      * “Thank you” card writers “**overestimated** how awkward recipients would
      feel and**underestimated** how positive recipients would feel.”

      * Conclusion: Our biases may keep us from the benefits of sharing
      gratitude.

      We highlighted several points of research and linked to them on our source
      page. In many cases, scientists point out the challenges to studying and
      measuring gratitude (how can you measure your true gratefulness?) but the
      conclusions they reach are sure to spark conversation -- or even a little
      "thanks."
