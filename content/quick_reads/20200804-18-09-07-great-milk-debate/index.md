      Scott Gottleib addressing food labels and the term "milk" - which he says
      refers to a product from a lactating animal. The FDA is reviewing the
      "public health consequences" of labeling different products "milk" when
      originally the term referred to only cow's milk.</blockquote><p><a

      <div><h2>Why This Matters</h2><ul><li>Big Picture: Americans drinking less
      dairy milk, while consumption of “alternative” milks (almond, coconut,
      oat, etc.) on the rise.</li><li>The dairy industry says use of the term
      “milk” for other products misleads the public into believing alternatives
      provide the same nutritional value as cow milk, when they don’t; they want
      a new law “protecting” the milk label.</li></ul></div>

      down.”<br><br><br><br>Michele Simon, Exec. Dir, Plant Based Foods
      Association, who wants to resolve this conflict in a "peaceful manner."
      The FDA has shown signs of empathy for the dairy industry, but enforcing
      any change to the language remains questionable.</blockquote>

      (whiskey produced in the United States in a particular way). Will that
