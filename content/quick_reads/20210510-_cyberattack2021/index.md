      A DAY, delivering nearly half of the fuel that's consumed on the East
      Coast.</h6><h6><strong>What Happened:</strong> Hackers infiltrated the

      <div><h2>Term To Know</h2><blockquote>“<strong>Ransomware</strong> is
      absolutely out of control and one of the biggest threats we face as a
      nation.” </blockquote><p>Cybersecurity expert David Kennedy, TrustedSec,
      on ransomware (aka "cyberextortion") - when criminals take over a computer
      system and hold it hostage, only returning access when owners pay a high
      fee, and possibly steal data for future use or sale.</p></div>

      associated with a criminal group called “DarkSide” is "responsible for the
      compromise of the Colonial Pipeline networks." <br></li><li>Unclear who
      did what, and when. Colonial says it "proactively took certain systems
      offline to contain the threat." Either way, business &amp; fuel
      distribution was disrupted.<br></li><li>The federal government loosened
      restrictions to transport oil by tanker truck because of the potential
      threat of fuel shortages.</li></ul></div>

      working closely with the company, state and local officials to make sure
      that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and
      there aren't disruptions in supply."</blockquote><p>Commerce Sec. Gina
      Raimondo, Sunday May 9th, on the DarkSide Colonial Pipeline attack. Days
      earlier, the Sec. of the Dept. of Homeland Security said ransomware
      attacks increased 300% over the last year with $350 million of ransom
      paid: "The threat is not tomorrow's threat, but it is upon us." </p></div>

      including one of the largest in the country. Read more about it on our
