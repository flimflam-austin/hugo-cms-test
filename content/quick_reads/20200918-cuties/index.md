      And, yeah, it’s dangerous.”</p><p>"Cuties" director and writer Maïmouna

      <div><blockquote>“…this film does immeasurable damage to all of us
      fighting to keep our children safe.”</blockquote><p>The Attorneys General
      of Florida, Louisiana, Ohio, &amp; Texas want the film removed from
      Netflix because they say it "shows the creation and publication of child
      pornography" and is counterproductive to the fight against human
      trafficking. Netflix has defended the film as "social
      commentary."</p></div>
