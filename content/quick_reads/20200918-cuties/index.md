      ## About “Cuties”


      * Sept 9: Netflix released the film about an**11-year-old** Senegalese
      girl living in Paris with her strict Muslim family.

      * In the film, the girl is torn between her traditional upbringing and a
      dance troupe she joins which engages in highly sensual dance moves (ex:
      pre-teens twerking in crop tops).

      * Some criticize the film’s “hyper-sexualization” of young girls. Others
      applaud it for highlighting the issue.

      “Our girls see that the more a woman is sexualized on social media, the
      more she’s successful. And the children just imitate what they see, trying
      to achieve the same result without understanding the meaning. And, yeah,
      it’s dangerous.”


      "Cuties" director and writer Maïmouna Doucouré, who said her own
      upbringing inspired her to make the film to "sound an alarm and say, 'We
      need to protect our children.'"

      > “…this film does immeasurable damage to all of us fighting to keep our
      children safe.”


      The Attorneys General of Florida, Louisiana, Ohio, & Texas want the film
      removed from Netflix because they say it "shows the creation and
      publication of child pornography" and is counterproductive to the fight
      against human trafficking. Netflix has defended the film as "social
      commentary."
