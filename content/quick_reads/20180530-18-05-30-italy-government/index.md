      # Europe Without Italy?


      ## Political Power Struggle


      Italy’s government in disarray; new elections possible; **stocks tumble
      worldwide on news.**


      Some say Italy’s fate could be **bigger than “Brexit”** and pull apart the
      European Union.


      in inglese, per favore

      ## Political Crisis Explained


      3 months after Italy’s parliamentary election, 2 winning parties finally
      compromised on a plan to govern.


      But this weekend, Italy’s **pro-EU** Pres. blocked the plan, vetoing the
      coalition’s pick for finance minister because he’s **anti-EU**.


      Now it’s a political standoff that will likely lead to new elections as
      soon as June.

      ## Why It Matters


      * Italy = Europe’s 3rd largest economy, effectively without a gov’tA since
      March elections.

      * Now concerns that Italy’s political uncertainty could spill into the
      global economy & financial markets, and threaten survival of European
      Union.


      Now What?

      Another round of elections may serve as a proxy vote on Italy leaving EU.
      Global markets sold off on that prospect with Eurozone Bank Index (Big
      Bank stocks) suffering biggest daily drop since 2016 Brexit vote - U.K's
      decision to leave the European Union.

Speaking on Sky News, Mr Chishti said:What you are seeing in Italy is people are saying they want a different kind of relationship with the European Union.I think you are seeing that across Europe. **It is a wake-up call to the European Union if it wasn”t before.People are not very happy with the direction that it is going.A** We certainly have gone in a different direction by there referendum, where the people have decided the United Kingdom should decide its own borders, money and law.
