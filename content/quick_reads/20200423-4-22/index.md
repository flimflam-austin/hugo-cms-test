      ## IMMIGRATION INTO U.S.


      > “We want to take care of our citizens first.”  
        
      Pres. Trump on his newly signed executive order mandating a 60-day
      immigration pause. The order only applies to immigrants outside the U.S.
      seeking green cards. Pres. Trump said the order will "ensure that
      unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as
      our economy reopens" and preserve healthcare resources.

    body: "## “REOPENING”\n\n> “The one way not to reopen the economy is to have rebound that we can’t take care of.”  \n  \nDr. Fauci pleading with America's leaders (and the American public) to carefully consider their reopening plans, and advising them to proceed in a careful and measured way. He emphasized the speed will be different for each community, and if we don't use caution step-by-step, there's\_a greater likelihood of \"a rebound we can't take care of.\""

      ONE LAST THING: Dr. Fauci reiterated that although animals can get
      COVID-19, there's "no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to
      a human." The Bronx Zoo reports eight felines have tested positive for
      COVID-19. Dr. Fauci said it's likely they were infected by a asymptomatic
      zoo keeper.
