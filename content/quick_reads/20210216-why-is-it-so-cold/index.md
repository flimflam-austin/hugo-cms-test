      # Why So Cold?


      > What’s causing the “wicked wintry weather” in so many parts of
      America?  
        
      (and why it matters wherever you live)

      ## “Polar Vortex”


      Cold temps partly to blame simply on winter… AND a phenomenon called
      the**polar vortex**:


      * The polar vortex = arctic air that normally hangs out around the poles;
      when unstable, it expands outward.

      * Polar vortex can bring**frigid temps each winter for varying periods of
      time**.

      * **Not a new concept** – polar vortex reportedly was first described in
      1853.

      ## Why It Matters  

      (Even If You’re Warm!)


      * Roughly half of America remains under some sort of winter weather
      advisory.

      * Emergency declarations in AL, OK, OR, KS, KY, MS, LA, TX; TX requested
      (& was granted) Federal Emergency Declaration for funding & resources.

      * Nationwide impact: weather has led to dangerous conditions, power
      outages,**delayed travel and deliveries (including COVID-19 vaccine)**.

      even all-time low temperature records in jeopardy.”


      National Weather Service on conditions that may break records dating back
      more than 100 years which marked "historic cold snaps of 1899 and 1905."

      The poor weather conditions are expected to last for the better part of
      the week. For context, The Weather Channel reports that there are
      currently more power outages in Texas due to the winter storm than
      occurred during the last major hurricane, Hurricane Harvey.
