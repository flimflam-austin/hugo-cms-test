    body: "## Why This Mattered\n\nAlthough Amelia became the **first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic just year’s earlier,\_**becoming\_the **first person** to fly solo from Honolulu to Oakland, CA was arguably a far greater accomplishment.\n\nIt’s a longer trip, with more time over the water, and greater risk to the pilot."

      > “The night I found over the Pacific was a night of stars. They seemed to
      rise from the sea and hang outside my cockpit window, near enough to
      touch, until hours later they slipped away into the dawn.”


      Amelia Earhart describing her 18-hour journey that included a rainy
      takeoff (complete with worrisome emergency crew nearby) and a hot
      chocolate at 8,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean.

      Amelia didn't just fly. She also created a fashion line for "the woman who
      lives actively" that included flight suits for female aviators and
      wrinkle-free clothing for the female traveler.
