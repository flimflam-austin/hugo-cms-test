      <div><blockquote>“The night I found over the Pacific was a night of stars.
      They seemed to rise from the sea and hang outside my cockpit window, near
      enough to touch, until hours later they slipped away into the
      dawn.”</blockquote><p>Amelia Earhart describing her 18-hour journey that
      included a rainy takeoff (complete with worrisome emergency crew nearby)
      and a hot chocolate at 8,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean.</p></div>
