      <div><h2>BACKSTORY</h2><ul><li>The Theory: Diseases have unique
      “<strong>odor</strong>prints.”</li><li>Past research has shown dogs can
      “sniff out” diabetes, malaria and different forms of cancer.</li><li>Early
      in the pandemic, researchers started studying dogs to see if they can
      detect COVID. Preliminary research shows promise for detecting cases
      *before* symptoms emerge.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“As far as we know, no other airport has attempted to use
      canine scent detection on such a large scale against
      COVID-19.”</blockquote><p>Director of Helsinki Airport, Ulla Lettijeff,
      where a recently launched pilot program is using COVID-sniffing dogs. Dogs
      do not sniff people directly but a wipe given to passengers (to wipe their
      skin, i.e. neck or wrist) and dropped in a cup. Dogs respond in 10
      seconds. Preliminary research from COVID-sniffing dogs used in Dubai's
      airport shows over 90% accuracy.</p></div>

      <div><p>“With covid detection, you are not recognizing the virus. You are
      recognizing the volatile byproducts of cells dying because they have been
      infected with the virus.”</p><p>Professor of chemistry Kenneth Suslick,
      University of Illinois, invented an electronic nose to sniff out
      explosives and diseases. He says research in this area continues to
      expand. What do dogs actually smell? Chemicals omitted in our sweat,
      saliva, and breath.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Their noses work very differently than ours. We breathe
      in and out through the same passages. But dogs breathe in one passage and
      out another so they can separate out the odor that they want to focus
      on.”</blockquote><p>Founder of BioScent K9, Heather Junqueira, a U.S.
      nonprofit training beagles and beagle-basset hound mixes to sniff out
      COVID-19. She says ideally a "positive" detection by a dog will be
      followed with an instant saliva test.</p></div>

      <div><p>Those optimistic think dogs may be more accurate than current
      testing, offering a powerful surveillance tool for returning communities
      back to "normal" by working at schools, stadiums and airports. Critics say
      training dogs is too expensive and time consuming to scale
      effectively.</p><p></p></div>
