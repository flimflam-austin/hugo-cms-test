      summer about an overnight summer camp in Georgia.<br></li><li>Staff and
      campers (ages 6-19) needed a negative SARS-CoV-2 test before
      attending.<br></li><li>Masks were required for staff - not
      campers.<br></li><li>A staff member tested positive for COVID-19. Days
      later, the camp shut down.<br></li><li>Of 597 staff/campers total, COVID
      test results were available for 344; 260 tested
      positive.</li><li><strong>Limitations</strong>: Researchers could not
      attribute ALL CASES back to the camp, as infection rates in Georgia were
      increasing at the time.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>"I wouldn't call them excessive, but they certainly are
      conservative."</blockquote><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci on the CDC's new guidance,
      saying that "it looks a bit strict, a bit stringent, but that's the reason
      why they keep looking at that and trying to reevaluate - literally - in
      real time whether or not that's the practical way to go." Dr. Fauci added
      that the CDC will “continually reevaluate“ the guidance for
      practicality.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>"I am supportive of effective measures to restrain the
      spread of illness. However, the CDC’s recommendations cross the line into
      excess and are, frankly, senseless. Children cannot be running around
      outside in 90-degree weather wearing a mask.
      Period.”</blockquote><p>Pediatric immunologist Dr. Mark Gorelik, Columbia
      University, who's studied rare side effects of COVID-19 in children, said
      that "irrational recommendations will do no good, could in this case do
      harm, and really discredit federal agencies.”</p></div>

      <p>On Monday, the FDA granted emergency use authorization of Pfizer's
      COVID-19 vaccine for use in children ages 12 to 15. The news comes days
      after CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that if there's FDA
      authorization of a COVID vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, she would
      "advocate" for them being able to take their masks off outdoors. On
      Thursday, the CDC said those vaccinated do not need to wear masks, indoor
      or outdoors.</p>
