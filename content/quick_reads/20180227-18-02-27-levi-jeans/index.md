      ## Levi: Jean Make-Over


      * The rips & holes in your jeans are often done by hand; one pair of jeans
      can take 20 minutes.

      * Distressing jeans can use 1,000s of chemicals.

      * Lasers allow last minute fashion design changes.

      * Shorter production time = Shorter turnaround time to consumers.

      * Levi says in next 2 years all jeans will use lasers.
