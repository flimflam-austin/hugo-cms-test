      <div><p><strong>Why Cherry Trees?</strong></p><ul><li>Eliza Scidmore:
      Well-known traveler, reporter, author, photographer, &amp; the woman who
      first introduced the idea of planting flowering cherry trees in
      D.C.</li><li>1885: After returning from a trip to Japan, she began
      advocating for cherry trees to be planted along the tidal wetlands near
      the White House &amp; Potomac River.</li><li>She was repeatedly turned
      down for 24 years – until First Lady Helen Taft heard her
      idea.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>How It Happened</h2><ul><li>1909: First Lady Taft introduced her
      plan to develop &amp; improve Potomac Park.</li><li>Scidmore heard of the
      plans &amp; reached out, explaining the cherry trees <em>“would be a great
      showing … a rosy tunnel of interlaced branches.”</em></li><li>First Lady
      Taft immediately agreed. Two notable Japanese men working in D.C. – a
      celebrated chemist and the consul general – heard of her proposal &amp;
      helped arrange a donation from Tokyo.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      Lady Taft and Iwa Chinda, the wife of the Japanese Ambassador, planted the
      first cherry trees along the Potomac River.</strong></li><li>The ceremony
      served as a symbol of international friendship.</li><li>The two trees are
      still standing &amp; located near the MLK Jr. Memorial.</li><li>Out of the
      approximately 4,000 cherry trees in D.C. parks today, fewer than 100 are

      <div><p>“Since they had to plant something in that great stretch of raw,
      reclaimed ground by the river bank … they might as well plant the most
      beautiful thing in the world—the Japanese cherry tree.”</p><p>Eliza
      Scidmore in a 1928 interview reflecting on why she advocated for cherry
      blossoms to be planted around the Tidal Basin in D.C. The land, mostly
      barren then, is now home to monuments such as the Jefferson Memorial and
      the MLK Jr. Memorial.</p></div>

      <p>Japan's initial donation of 2,000 cherry trees came two years earlier
      (1910). However, the trees arrived infected with insects and diseases and
      had to be burned to ensure native plants would not be harmed. In March
      1912, around 3,000 more cherry trees were donated (free of infections) and
      were quickly planted around D.C. to usher in spring.</p>
