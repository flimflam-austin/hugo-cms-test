      ## The Basics


      * **Where did embassy move from?**A Tel Aviv.

      * **Why is the move controversial? Jerusalem is disputed territory.**A
      Some consider Jerusalem part of the West Bank or Arab/Muslim, others
      consider it part of Israel or Jewish.

      * When people talk about “**Middle East Peace**” – debate over who “owns”
      Jerusalem at center.

      ## Why Now?


      * America’s move makes a clear statement about Israeli’s national
      sovereignty. **Israel considers Jerusalem its capital; Now America does as
      well.**

      * President Trump delivering on campaign promise.

      * Timing coincides w/U.S. withdrawing from Iran Deal, reaffirmsA
      **Israel-America alliance; Israel is a U.S. ally.**

      > _‘We are not taking a position on final status issues, including the
      specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, nor on the
      resolution of contested borders.”_  
        
        
        
      U.S. State Department's official statement on Jerusalem embassy opening,
      an attempt to leave room for negotiations that *could* bring peace or an
      territorial agreement between Israel & the West Bank.

      The embassy move is symbolic in many ways. The U.S. ambassador and a small
      team will set up in a temporary location in Jerusalem. 850 members of the
      U.S. embassy will stay in Tel Aviv while a new building is built. That
      could take nearly a decade.
