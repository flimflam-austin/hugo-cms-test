      <blockquote>“It’s not NAFTA redone. It’s a brand new deal.”<br><br>Pres.
      Trump announcing the trade agreement between U.S. &amp; Mexico. The new
      deal has a new name: United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. The
      President says it "will send cash and jobs pouring into the United
      States"; other analysts say the impact on the overall economy will be very
      little.</blockquote>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><blockquote>“My expectation all along
      was that there would be few major changes and NAFTA would go from being
      one of the worst deals ever to the one of the best…. The bigger issue is
      the positive impact on confidence and sentiment.”<br><br><br>Jim
      O'Sullivan, economist at High Frequency Economics to
      CNBC.</blockquote></div>
