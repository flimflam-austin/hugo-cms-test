      have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran’s treasury, seized valuable
      portions of the economy, and looted the people’s religious endowments, all
      to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war. <strong>Not
      good</strong>.”<br><br><br><br>Pres. Trump, United Nations General
      Assembly, Sept 25, 2018</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“OPEC and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of
      the world, and I don’t like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of
      these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us
      high oil prices. <strong>Not good.</strong>“<br><br><br>Pres. Trump
      referred to America as the largest energy producer anywhere on the face of
      the Earth - a fact that U.S. oil production now outpaces all other
      nations.</blockquote>

      nearly 50% of total world’s oil supply.</li><li>OPEC “stabilizes” oil
      markets by agreeing to certain production output; that supply impacts
      price.</li><li>Pres. Trump wants OPEC to keep oil supply up, so prices
      stay down. <strong>OPEC may not agree</strong>.</li></ul></div>

      OPEC.</li><li>Expected U.S. sanctions will prevent some Iranian oil from
      hitting the market.</li><li>Less global supply = potentially higher oil
      prices.</li><li>Higher oil prices may impact U.S. economy. This is why
      Pres. Trump wants OPEC to ramp up production, in part, to cover
      U.S.-imposed loss of Iranian oil.</li></ul></div>
