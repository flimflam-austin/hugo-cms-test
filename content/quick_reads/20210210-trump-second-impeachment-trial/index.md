      <div><blockquote>“President Trump gravely endangered the security of the
      United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the
      integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful
      transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of
      government.”</blockquote><p>The article of impeachment charges "incitement
      of insurrection" for Pres. Trump's words &amp; conduct in the days &amp;
      moments leading up to the riot.</p></div>

      <div><h2>TRIAL BASICS</h2><ul><li>The Senate impeachment trial is not a
      criminal trial, but it will look like one.</li><li>House impeachment
      managers (lawmakers chosen by the House) will “prosecute,” presenting the
      case for impeachment to the Senate; the fmr. president’s lawyers will
      defend him.</li><li>Senators will vote on procedural motions (ex: whether
      to allow witnesses), impeachment, and *perhaps ultimately*
      disqualification.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>ARGUMENTS</h2><ul><li>House impeachment managers will argue Pres.
      Trump provoked illegal action. They’ll also argue the trial is
      constitutional b/c otherwise outgoing presidents may engage in wrongful
      conduct without recourse.</li><li>Pres. Trump’s lawyers will argue he did
      not incite violence and his speech is protected under the First Amendment.
      They’ll argue the trial is unconstitutional since Pres. Trump is not in
      office.</li></ul></div>

      ever been convicted in a Senate impeachment trial.</li><li><strong>67 of
      100:</strong> Conviction requires a 2/3 supermajority in the Senate.
      Assuming all 50 Democrats vote to convict, they’ll need 17 Republicans to
      join them.</li><li><strong>51 of 100:</strong> Disqualification from
      office requires a simple majority. Assuming all 50 Democrats vote to
      disqualify, they’ll need one Republican to join them.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Pres. Trump is only the third president ever impeached but the
      fourth to face impeachment proceedings. Impeachment proceedings began
      against Pres. Nixon, but he resigned before the House had the opportunity
      to vote.</p><p></p></div>
