      ## “Ban” Basics


      Saudi Arabia: **only country in world where women can’t drive.**


      No official law prohibits women from driving butA **only men are allowed
      to obtain driver’s licenses**.A This changes on June 24 when women can get
      a driver’s license – part of a reform plan called “Vision 2030”

      Saudi Arabia follows ‘**Wahhabism**‘, a form of Islam that says women:


      * should be separated from men they are not related to

      * wear veils to cover themselves while in public

      * be accompanied by a male guardian (usually a relative or husband) unless
      they receive written permission from a male guardian

      ## Why Now?


      * Crown Prince recently visited U.S., spoke about reform, including for
      women. **He lobbied & secured major investment based on “Vision2030”.**

      * In the past, he’s suddenly arrested groups of business men &
      controversial Islamic clerics.

      * Women under arrest reportedly called “**traitors**” by govt but **little
      other explanation exists**.

      Rights activists say they (the women) are being targeted because the
      government doesn’t want human-rights advocates to claim credit for the
      lifting of the driving ban. WSJ
