      Jeannette Rankin (R-MT) when she was elected in 1916. Montana had granted
      women the right to vote two years earlier and she had gained notoriety, in
      part, as a suffragist. Today, 26 women serve in the U.S. Senate & 101
      women serve in the House. Women make up nearly 24% of Congress. Rankin
      hoped, “We’re (women) half the people; we should be half the Congress.”

      Congresswoman Jeanette Rankin (R-MT) delivering a speech on women's right
      to vote. She helped pass a women's suffrage resolution in the House in
      1918; the same resolution died in the Senate. She was not in office two
      years later when the 19th Amendment was officially adopted, altering the
      Constitution to grant women the right to vote.

      Rankin reportedly received applause as she was sworn into Congress. Later
      that evening, Pres. Wilson asked lawmakers to vote to declare war on
      Germany; Rankin was one of 50 lawmakers who voted "no." She said, "I want
      to stand by my country, but I cannot vote for war."
