      Vice Pres. Pence said today that although COVID-19 is 3X more contagious
      than the flu, about 90% of people tested so far have tested negative. The
      U.S. gov’t will partially close the borders with Mexico and Canada to
      restrict nonessential travel in order to stem spread of COVID-19, and
      extend the deadline for filing federal taxes to July 15.
