* NEW YORK TIMES:  
_There”s money for fencing, but no wall._  
_Nowhere was the dynamic on more vivid display than on Mr. Trump”s cherished proposal to spend tens of billions of dollars on a wall on the nation”s border with Mexico.The bill includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security — including new technology and repairs to existing barriers — but not Mr. Trump”s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. That includes $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing that was previously authorized under the 2006 Secure Fence Act, passed during the George W. Bush administration. But the measure prohibits building a concrete wall or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.The measure also explicitly rejects Mr. Trump”s plan for a hiring spree of border officers, an idea critics have condemned as an attempt to unleash a deportation force. The president signed an executive order during his first week in office last year calling for 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and he sought 2,000 in his budget request. The bill caps the number at 65_.A [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/trump-government-spending-bill.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/trump-government-spending-bill.html)
