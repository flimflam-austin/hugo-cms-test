      ## WHAT TO KNOW:


      * Enacted to save coal in the spring of 1918 during WWI, but made optional
      by Congress after the war.

      * Re-established during WWII. In 1966, became law under Uniform Time Act.

      * Arizona, Hawaii, & U.S. Territories such as Puerto Rico don’t follow
      DST.

      * Since 2018, 13 states passed laws to enact year-round DST – no more
      “falling back.” But those laws still require Congress to sign off on them
      to take effect.

      ## ALSO WORTH NOTING:


      Transition to & from DST linked to several health issues, including:


      * Higher heart attack & stroke risk

      * Drop in success rates for IVF

      * Fatigue, decreased productivity

      * Worsening S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder) associated w/ lack of
      sunshine


      Most are due to *temporary* sleep deprivation & circadian rhythm changes.

      Approx. 8 months of the year are in daylight saving time & 4 months are in
      standard time. For those who miss the evening sunlight... we go back to
      daylight saving time on Sunday, March 14, 2021. That's 6 days before
      spring arrives.
