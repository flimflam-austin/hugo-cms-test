      1918 during WWI, but made optional by Congress after the
      war.</li><li>Re-established during WWII. In 1966, became law under Uniform
      Time Act.</li><li>Arizona, Hawaii, &amp; U.S. Territories such as Puerto
      Rico don’t follow DST.</li><li>Since 2018, 13 states passed laws to enact
      year-round DST – no more “falling back.” But those laws still require
      Congress to sign off on them to take effect.</li></ul></div>
