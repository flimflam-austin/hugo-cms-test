      > _“We’re really at a point of reckoning in so many ways. We’re asking
      really big question about our health, and our safety. We’re asking big
      question about what it means to be American…Yes, we’re at a point of
      reckoning, but I keep thinking of the renaissance. Those (who) go through
      the difficult period of asking those big questions are often those who
      lead that next stage.”_
