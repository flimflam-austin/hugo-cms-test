      ## Jan. 2020: What To Know


      **29,200** people apprehended attempting to illegally cross the border in
      January.


      That’s **3,600+** fewer than December.


      And nearly **19,000** less than last January.


      The decrease is due, in part, to fewer family units apprehended.

      ## IMPORTANT CONTEXT


      Last year, at the peak, nearly **133,000** people were apprehended at the
      southwest border in one month; more than 70% were family units (84,000+) &
      unaccompanied minors (11,000+).


      Last month, **29,200** people were apprehended; 26% were family units
      (5,000+) or unaccompanied minors (2600+).

      ## Something To Consider


      While the decrease of border apprehensions Jan 2020 is a dramatic drop
      from Jan 2019, the difference seems less drastic when comparing it with
      numbers from prior recent years.


      In fact, on average, roughly **30,000** people were apprehended or deemed
      inadmissable on the southwest border each month between 2015-2018. In
      2019, the monthly average more than doubled.

      “We’ve seen eight straight months of decline, but as we see from the
      seizure of the longest-ever tunnel between the U.S. and Mexico and
      significant drug seizures, much work remains.”


      CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan on January's numbers. The 70ft-deep
      tunnel ran over three-quarters of a mile from Mexico into Southern
      California, had a cart/rail system, electricity, ventilation, and even an
      elevator. No arrests or seizures came from the discovery.

      > “As efforts to strengthen security on our Southern Border increase,
      Mexican drug cartels are forced underground to smuggle their deadly drugs
      into the United States. The sophistication of this tunnel demonstrates the
      determination and monetary resources of the cartels.”


      DEA Special Agent in Charge John Callery.

      Pres. Trump wants to reallocate billions of dollars for border wall
      construction. Today, about 1/3 (654 miles) of the southern border is
      equipped with barriers. About 1,300 miles has no barrier (not all the
      terrain allows for a wall).
