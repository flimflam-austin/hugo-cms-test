      ## MEMORIAL DAY


      A day honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice likely began with
      grieving women honoring their loved ones (and their once-enemies) in the
      exact same way, at the exact same time.

      ## Did You Know?


      * Memorial Day tradition dates back to just after the Civil War.

      * Specifically honors those killed in action.

      * Commonly called “Decoration Day” at the time, as flowers or other items
      were used to decorate graves.

      * May 30th reportedly chosen because it’s the time of year when ample
      flowers bloom nationwide.

      ## Here’s The Backstory


      * About 25 cities claim ties to the first Memorial Day.

      * In one well-publicized story, women in Columbus, Mississippi visited a
      cemetery in April 1866 to decorate the graves of Confederate soldiers and
      saw neglected graves of Union soldiers. They decided to place flowers on
      ALL the graves despite the war ending just a year earlier.

      > “They start to see these Union graves that are just laying there, kind
      of barren….Their hearts start to feel bad for the mothers who have lost
      these children. So, they start to throw flowers on the Yankee graves. And
      then that story gets published everywhere.”


      Dr. Richard Gardiner, co-author of "The Genesis of the Memorial Day
      Holiday," argues the women in Mississippi were simply following a proposal
      by a women's association in Georgia weeks earlier.

      ## The Official Beginning

      Civil War veteran & lawmaker who advocated for others who had served.

      * Fmr. Union General & soon-to-be-elected President Ulysess S. Grant
      attended.

      * About 5,000 people gathered & put small American flags on graves;**about
      the same # of people attend in modern times and do exactly the same
      thing.**

      "We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance...Let no vandalism of
      avarice of neglect, no ravages of time, testify to the present or to the
      coming generations that we have forgotten, as a people, the cost of free
      and undivided republic." Maj. General John A. Logan
