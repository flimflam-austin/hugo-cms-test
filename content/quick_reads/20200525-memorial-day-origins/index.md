      <div><h2>MEMORIAL DAY</h2><p>A day honoring those who made the ultimate
      sacrifice likely began with grieving women honoring their loved ones (and
      their once-enemies) in the exact same way, at the exact same
      time.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Here’s The Backstory</h2><ul><li>About 25 cities claim ties to
      the first Memorial Day.</li><li>In one well-publicized story, women in
      Columbus, Mississippi visited a cemetery in April 1866 to decorate the
      graves of Confederate soldiers and saw neglected graves of Union soldiers.
      They decided to place flowers on ALL the graves despite the war ending
      just a year earlier.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“They start to see these Union graves that are just
      laying there, kind of barren….Their hearts start to feel bad for the
      mothers who have lost these children. So, they start to throw flowers on
      the Yankee graves. And then that story gets published
      everywhere.”</blockquote><p>Dr. Richard Gardiner, co-author of "The
      Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday," argues the women in Mississippi were
      simply following a proposal by a women's association in Georgia weeks
      earlier.</p></div>
