      # New Human Organ?


      ## “Interstitium”


      Study says its discovered the body’s biggest organ AND it may hold the
      **key to understanding how cancer spreads.**


      But is it really as “new” as reported? **Some say no…they’ve known about
      it for DECADES.**

      > “This finding has **potential to drive dramatic advances in medicine**,
      including the possibility that the direct sampling of interstitial fluid
      may become a powerful diagnostic tool.”

      ## Why It Matters:


      “New” organ = mesh-like fluid-filled spaces that provide both cushion and
      connective tissue to entire body.


      _“Importantly, the finding that this layer is a highway of moving fluid
      may explain why cancer that invades it becomes much more likely to
      spread.” Study Authors_

      ## NOT “News” To Some…


      * **Myofascial Release**: Developed more than 4 decades ago.

      * Form of body work that targets connective tissue to loosen or “release”
      the fascia for health benefits.

      * Instead of “interstitium”, therapists call the **entire** network
      “fascia”.

      Now that science & alternative healing seem to be on the same page - read
      more on how this may help us diagnose and treat diseases like cancer and
      beyond.

* **Full Quote from Myofascial Release pioneer John F. Barnes to SmartHer News**:_“It is refreshing to see science is finally catching up to what I’ve been teaching in my Myofascial Release seminars for the last 40 years. A The fascial system is one of the most important structures of our body and is significantly tightened from physical or emotional trauma which produces crushing pressure on pain sensitive structures. A It produces symptoms of pain, headaches, fibromyalgia and a myriad of women’s pain and health problems.__The fascinating fascia is a liquid crystal three dimensional web. A In the space of the web, which is actually not space, but a fluid/viscous substance called the ground substance of the fascia which tends to solidify due to trauma and is the main transport medium of our body. **A This means that whatever nutrition we ingest, the fluid we drink, the air we breathe, all the biochemistry hormones and information/energy that every one of the trillion of cells needs to thrive must go through the fluidity of the fascia**.”__“I would highly recommend purchasing Dr. Jean-Claude Guimberteau’s book, Architecture of Human Living Fascia. He is a French hand surgeon and he represents over 20 years of research on the fascial system. If you go to page 163, I have provided a more detailed explanation of the fascial system and Myofascial Release.”_-John F. Barnes
