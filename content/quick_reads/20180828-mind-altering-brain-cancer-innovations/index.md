      <div><h2>Why Do We Call It Cancer?</h2><blockquote>“The word cancer is
      derived from the Latin word for crab because cancers are often very
      irregularly shaped, and because, like a crab, they “grab on and don’t let
      go.”<br><br><br><br>Johns Hopkins University describes cancer as irregular
      cell growth that can turn deadly. Est. 1 out of 100 cancer diagnoses will
      be brain cancer; it's also the second most common form of cancer in
      children (behind Leukemia).</blockquote></div>

Treatment innovations  
Brain cancer research is a very active field of study. Researchers are investigating new ways to deliver drugs to brain tumors, including pumps that release a continuous, slow flow of chemotherapy or targeted drug therapies to a tumor. This type of treatment is called convection-enhanced delivery (CED).  
Another type of therapy uses technology called tumor treating fields (Optune) to deliver electric fields to the brain, which can help stop the proliferation of cancer cells. Optune is a wearable, portable device and is used in combination with temozolomide to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults.  
Implanted, biodegradable wafer therapy (Gliadel) relies on an implanted disc to release chemotherapy to tumor tissue that remains after surgery. And in nanoparticle therapy, particles with an unusually high surface area carry chemotherapy across the blood-brain barrier directly to a tumor.
