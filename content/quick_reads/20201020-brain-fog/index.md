      > If you talk to a significant number of people, they will tell you that,
      for anywhere from weeks to months and possibly longer, that they have
      symptoms that are characterized by fatigue and a thing that they refer to
      as brain fog, which really means the difficulty concentrating.”


      Dr. Anthony Fauci revealing during an interview with '60 Minutes' one of
      his concerns over the long-term impact of the virus that causes COVID-19.

      > “It’s all related. The fact that people are losing their sense of smell,
      the fact that people are losing their sense of taste, and the brain fog —
      all this whole system is neurological.”


      Stanford researcher Dr. Kari Nadeau leads an ongoing Stanford study on
      long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Patients recovering from COVID, across
      age groups and gender, have described "brain fog" (a lack of mental
      clarity, confusion) since early in the pandemic.

      > “Everything in my brain was white static … I was sitting on the edge of
      the bed, crying and feeling ‘something’s wrong, I should be asking for
      help,’ but I couldn’t remember who or what I should be asking. I forgot
      who I was and where I was.”


      31-year-old Erica Taylor who says her "brain fog" after COVID-19 became so
      debilitating she was forced to take a temporary leave from her job.

      ## What Do We Know:


      > “It’s subtle, but it is very real.”


      * The “dysfunction” some have experienced usually won’t surface during a
      brain scan, according to neurologist Dr. Joanna Hellmuth at University of
      California, San Francisco.

      * Hellmuth says she sees the impact on cognitive tests, consistent with
      other viruses that can impact cognitive health.

      ## Why?


      No one knows 100%.


      Here’s some early thinking:


      * Brain cells *can* (though rarely) become infected with COVID-19.

      * Inflammation of the body can lead to issues including small, subtle
      strokes.

      * Low oxygen levels in the blood can have an impact.

      * An exhausted immune system could play a role.

      One encouraging note: Doctors and those recovering from COVID-19 say this
      fog can "lift" - that it's not permanent. A reminder: This week marks 9
      months since the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in America; research on
      the impact of COVID - both mentally and physically - remains limited.
