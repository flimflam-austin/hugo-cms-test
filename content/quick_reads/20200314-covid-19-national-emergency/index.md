      ## Three Effects Of The Emergency Declaration


      * Access to up to $50B in **federal money** to aid communities affected by
      the outbreak.

      * Activates FEMA. For example: FEMA can **disperse aid** (tests, medicine,
      food, supplies) to states & localities.

      * Provides more flexibility by waiving licensing laws so **healthcare
      workers** can provide care across state lines or “telehealth” (provide
      care remotely).

      “These kind of things generally run out in a few months. Hopefully, we’ll
      make it several weeks — eight, nine, whatever weeks. But I can’t give you
      a number because it depends on how successful we are.”


      Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
      Infectious Diseases, on the stakes of slowing the spread of COVID-19.

      MORE MONEY: Last week, Pres. Trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency funding
      bill to combat COVID-19, but that money will soon run out. Congress is
      *reportedly* on the verge of agreeing to another federal stimulus package.
