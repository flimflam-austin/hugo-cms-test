      pay.</strong></p><p>One example of many potential changes: New “NAFTA”
      agreement reportedly requires <strong>more</strong> U.S. car parts made in
      America with more U.S. material (like steel) in exchange for the “no tax”
      benefit for companies.</p><p>The Concern?</p></div>

      any changes to Nafta auto rules of origin continue to strike the right
      balance by <strong>incentivizing production and investment in North
      America</strong> while keeping new vehicles <strong>affordable for more
      Americans</strong>.’<br><br><br><br>Alliance of Auto

      <div><p>The North American Trade Agreement was a result of a trifecta of
      Mexico, Canada &amp; the U.S. Since the U.S. &amp; Mexico have a working
      template, the big question is: Will Canada agree to negotiations or stall
      them?</p><p><a href="https://smarthernews.com/a-new-nafta/">view
