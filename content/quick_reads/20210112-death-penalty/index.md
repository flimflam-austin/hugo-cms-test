      imposed by our justice system.”</blockquote><p>Former Attorney General
      William Barr in 2019 announcing the resumption of federal executions after
      an informal 17-year moratorium; the federal gov't adopted a new lethal
      injection protocol after years of legal challenges. In recent years,
      bipartisan support has backed the elimination of the death
      penalty.</p></div>
