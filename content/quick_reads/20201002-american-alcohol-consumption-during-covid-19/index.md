      alcohol, but this is some of the first survey-based information that shows
      how much alcohol consumption has increased during the pandemic.”

      ## WHY IT MATTERS


      * In April, the World Health Org. recommended that people currently
      restrict their alcohol consumption b/c of its negative impacts, incl. on
      mental health & potential to compromise people’s immune systems.

      * The study’s author echoed similar concerns, noting the results
      suggest_“another way that the pandemic may be affecting the physical and
      mental health of Americans_.”

      Why are women drinking more frequently? This study doesn't say.
      Separately, a UK study found those with the greatest increase in mental
      distress during the pandemic included young adults (18-24), women, and
      those with small children.
