      consuming more alcohol, but this is some of the first survey-based

      <div><h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2><ul><li>In April, the World Health Org.
      recommended that people currently restrict their alcohol consumption b/c
      of its negative impacts, incl. on mental health &amp; potential to
      compromise people’s immune systems.</li><li>The study’s author echoed
      similar concerns, noting the results suggest <em>“another way that the
      pandemic may be affecting the physical and mental health of
      Americans</em>.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Why are women drinking more frequently? This study doesn't say.
      Separately, a UK study found those with the greatest increase in mental
      distress during the pandemic included young adults (18-24), women, and
      those with small children.</p><p></p></div>
