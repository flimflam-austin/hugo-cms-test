      A hilarious read for a serious time. We learned of water on the moon the
      same week a Blue Moon arrives on Halloween (a blue moon or a second full
      moon in one month arrives once every 2-3 years), a full moon on Halloween
      (once every 19 years). Read Jason Gay's full piece on our source page.

[**How to Buy a Beach House on the Moon**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-buy-a-beach-house-on-the-moon-11603893335?mod=hp_listc_pos2)  
A thrilling scientific discovery may further motivate billionaires already racing to space

Scientists believe that the moon has water, and this is a big deal, because if the moon has water, it probably has sparkling water, and if it has sparkling water, it probably has at least a few appetizers and a decent wine list. Yes, I know the scientists think there’s only a teeny, tiny amount of water deep in the lunar rock, but who really knows for sure? All I know is that the scientists are excited, and if the scientists are excited, I’m excited, too.

Does it mean we all will live on the moon soon? Well, you see what’s happening on Earth. I don’t think we should be ruling out any options.

Of course, billionaires have been mooning over the moon for a while—planning private spaceships and intergalactic getaways—and the discovery of water will only heighten the enthusiasm. After all, the only thing a billionaire likes more than being a billionaire is owning waterfront property, and the more of it, the better. No plutocrat portfolio is complete without a Malibu “shack,” a Vineyard “camp,” a Palm Beach “escape,” a Tahoe “retreat,” a Hawaiian “bungalow” and a Hampton “cottage” the size of a Costco.

But a waterfront lair on the lunar surface? That’s both an old Jimmy Buffett song (“Beach House on the Moon”) and a new real estate craving, with all sorts of dilemmas and questions. What moon waterfront is best? Do you want to be on the bay side or ocean side? Are there lakes on the Moon? Do moon lakes have bugs in August? (It’s only a matter of time before the Journal introduces a section called “Moon Mansion.”).
