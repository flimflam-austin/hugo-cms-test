      ## You WILL See This:


      * **Biometric ID:**A Braves, Athletics & Mariners are the latest teams
      allowing fans to use fingerprints and retinal scans to enter stadium or
      buy concessions.

      * **Real-time instant replay:** In an effort to speed up the game, teams
      get immediate access to slo-mo cameras & phone lines to teams’ review
      centers to decide whether or not to challenge a call.

      ## Take Me Out to the Ballgame – Or Not.


      * Twitter will again live stream weekly MLB games.

      * Facebook will**exclusively** stream 25 regular season games (big deal,
      but small considering there’s 2,430 games this season)

      * MLB is also tapping the Chinese market, partnering with Tencent to
      stream 125 games to its 1B active users.
