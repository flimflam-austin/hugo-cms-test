      ### What to know as a jury finds Derek Chauvin guilty of the murder of
      George Floyd.

      > "We the jury … find the defendant guilty."


      Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill reading the verdict from the
      jury, who found Derek Chauvin guilty of all three charges: second-degree
      murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. Judge Cahill
      will solely decide Chauvin's sentence when sentencing takes place in about
      8 weeks. Exact dates TBD.

      > "The state would move for the court to revoke the defendant's bail and
      remand him into custody."


      A member of the prosecution team speaking off camera to the judge, who
      granted the request. Chauvin was handcuffed and taken into custody. The
      Associated Press reports Chauvin was taken to a maximum security prison,
      the same one where he was held due to security concerns after his arrest.

      the sentencing guidelines.”


      MN Attorney General Keith Ellison. The prosecution and the defense will
      prepare legal briefs for the judge's consideration in sentencing. The
      three guilty verdicts carry different *potential* sentences (ex:
      2nd-degree murder is punishable by up to 40 yrs behind bars) but
      sentencing *guidelines* can be much lower (ex: 12.5 yrs for 2nd-degree
      murder for someone, like Chauvin, w/o a criminal history).

      Pres. Biden during a national address said the murder of George Floyd
      exposed systemic racism in America and systemic misconduct in police
      departments. Pres. Biden said that "most men and women who wear the badge
      serve their communities honorably. But those few who fail to meet that
      standard must be held accountable." VP Harris also spoke, similarly
      advocating for Congress to pass police reform legislation: "A measure of
      justice isn’t the same as equal justice."

  - order: 5
    useCheckmark: false
    body: >-
      > "To deny the progress we've made, is just as damaging as not making
      progress at all."


      Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) supports the verdict and said it should renew
      confidence in the justice system. Sen. Scott, the lone black Republican
      senator, proposed his own police reform legislation last year after
      Floyd's death. A separate bill was proposed by two black Democrat
      senators, Sen Booker (D-NJ) and then-Senator (now VP) Kamala Harris.
      Neither bill passed.

      From local Minneapolis station KARE: "Chauvin’s conviction marks only the
      second time a police officer has been convicted of murder in Minnesota,
      and the first time such a conviction has been won against a white officer
      who killed a Black man." Read more from that local station with leading
      reporting on our source page.
