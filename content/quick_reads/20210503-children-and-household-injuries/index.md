      <div><h2>Backstory:</h2><ul><li>An independent federal agency, the U.S.
      Consumer Product Safety Comm. (CPSC), "urges" Americans to stop using the
      Peloton Tread+ b/c it poses "serious risks" to children - such as
      abrasions, fractures &amp; death.</li><li>"39 incidents including one
      death"...from "becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under" the Peloton
      Tread+ (CPSC).</li><li>Peloton calls CPSC's statement "inaccurate and
      misleading," reminding all users to remove the device's safety key when
      not in use.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Context:</h2><h6>Approx. 48 million = children under the age of
      11 in America.</h6><h6>2,000 = reported treadmill injuries among children
      8 and under in 2019.</h6><h6>Any loss of life is significant. Considering
      the rarity of this injury, we wanted to *also* ask:</h6><h6><em>After a
      year where many families spent more time at home than ever before, what
      does the data show about common dangers for children in every
      household?</em></h6></div>

      <div><h2>TIP-OVERS</h2><ul><li>Unintentional injuries are the leading
      cause of death in U.S. kids (CDC). </li><li>Tip-over accidents involving
      furniture, TVs &amp; appliances sent an estimated 11,300 children on
      average to the ER each year and reportedly killed 469 children ( 1 month
      to 14 years old) from 2000 - 2019 (CPSC).</li><li>PREVENTION TIP: CPSC
      recommends anchoring down household items such as dressers, bookcases,
      TVs, TV stands and beyond.</li></ul></div>

      the ER daily and two die each day (CDC). </li><li>Many result from
      medicines, cosmetics, or cleaning products, but plants rank #10 on the
      list of top pediatric poison exposures from kiddos ingesting houseplants
      (National Poison Data System).</li><li>PREVENTION TIP: Do a simple
      "background check" on your plants before bringing them home, especially if

      children was issued in 2008! We reached out to the CDC to see if there's
      any updated *definitive* data.</p><p>Meanwhile, a federal class action
      lawsuit was filed against Peloton, accusing the company of selling and
      marketing the Tread+ "<em>as safe and appropriate for use by families in
      the home, even though its design makes it inherently and uniquely
      dangerous to childre</em>n." </p></div>
