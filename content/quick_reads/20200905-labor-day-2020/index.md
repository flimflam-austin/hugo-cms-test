      <div><blockquote>“Labor Day, the first Monday in September, is a creation
      of the labor movement and is dedicated to the social and economic
      achievements of American workers. It constitutes a yearly national tribute
      to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and
      well-being of our country.”</blockquote><p>The U.S. Department of Labor on
      the significance of Labor Day.</p></div>

      place.”</blockquote><p>One description of the first Labor Day Parade in

      <div><blockquote>“Of course you can wear white after Labor Day, and it
      makes perfect sense to do so in climates where September’s temperatures
      are hardly fall-like… The true interpretation is ‘wear what’s
      appropriate—for the weather, the season, or the
      occasion.'”</blockquote><p>The Emily Post Institute's take on the "no
      white after Labor Day rule". The rule's origins aren't entirely clear, but
      it likely originated among wealthy urban dwellers in the early
      1900s.</p></div>

      <div><p>This year is the 126th year Labor Day will be celebrated as a
      federal holiday. It's one of only ten and the last one of the 19th
      century. Veterans Day, Columbus Day, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s
      birthday became federal holiday during the 20th century. Some believe the
      federal gov't should make Election Day a federal holiday</p><p></p></div>
