      > “Labor Day, the first Monday in September, is a creation of the labor
      movement and is dedicated to the social and economic achievements of
      American workers. It constitutes a yearly national tribute to the
      contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and
      well-being of our country.”

      ## ORIGINS


      * Holiday’s founder debated, but labor unions advocated for it for many
      years before the movement gained steam.

      * **1880s:** Celebrated first as a local or state holiday. First Labor Day
      parade took place in NYC. 23 states celebrated it before it became a
      federal holiday.

      * **1894:** Pres. Cleveland made it a holiday to celebrate the
      “**_nobility_**” of work and givie the working man “**_a reasonable amount
      of rest and recreation_**.”

      beverages.

      > “Of course you can wear white after Labor Day, and it makes perfect
      sense to do so in climates where September’s temperatures are hardly
      fall-like… The true interpretation is ‘wear what’s appropriate—for the
      weather, the season, or the occasion.'”


      The Emily Post Institute's take on the "no white after Labor Day rule".
      The rule's origins aren't entirely clear, but it likely originated among
      wealthy urban dwellers in the early 1900s.

      This year is the 126th year Labor Day will be celebrated as a federal
      holiday. It's one of only ten and the last one of the 19th century.
      Veterans Day, Columbus Day, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday
      became federal holiday during the 20th century. Some believe the federal
      gov't should make Election Day a federal holiday
