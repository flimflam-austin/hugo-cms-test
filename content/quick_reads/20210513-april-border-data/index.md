      <div><h2>BIG PICTURE</h2><ul><li>The influx of illegal immigration along
      the southwest border continued in April. <strong>The data reflects
      record-setting numbers.</strong></li><li>The number of unaccompanied
      children decreased slightly over the last month, and single adults (62%)
      continue to represent the largest demographic group attempting
      entry.</li><li>The influx has also led to increased dangers at the border
      and beyond. Last month, CBP engaged in over 870 life-saving rescues and
      seized over 58,600 lbs of illicit drugs. </li></ul></div>

    body: "<p>In April, CBP launched a new anti-smuggling effort to combat transnational\_criminal organizations (TCOs). CBP says these organizations and those associated with them \"pose significant dangers to migrants as they not only seek to profit from their exploitation but also have little regard for their wellbeing, exposing them to violent encounters, injury, and death.\" To date, the new effort resulted in the revocation of over 130 visas associated with TCOs.</p>"
