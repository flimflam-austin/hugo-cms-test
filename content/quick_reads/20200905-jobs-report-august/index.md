      > “We’re in a very deep hole, and we’re working our way out of it. We
      continue to see very good improvement in the labor market, but I think the
      improvement is going to be slower going forward.”


      Economist Gus Faucher PNC Financial Services Group. The Labor Dept.
      credited "resumption of economic activity" for the job growth in August,

      ## Something To Consider


      **HISTORIC**: Previous to the pandemic, America had never recorded more
      than 700,000 people filing for unemployment benefits in one week. The
      4-week moving average hovers under 1M.


      **LAYOFFS**: United Airlines, Bed Bath & Beyond, & MGM Resorts recently
      announced major layoffs, sparking concern this reflects a permanent,
      rather than temporary, adjustment.

      The unemployment rate in January 2020 was 3.6% - the lowest in more than
      50 years. The economy has shed more than 22M jobs during the COVID-19
      pandemic - about half have been recovered. Story to watch? Lawmakers
      return to D.C. after Labor Day at odds over additional economic stimulus,
      incl. additional benefits for the unemployed.

**Context for Jobs Report this is what was written back in** **[February](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/us-jobs-report-february-2020.html):**

_The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 273,000 new jobs during the month, while the unemployment rate was 3.5%, matching its lowest level in more than 50 years. An alternative measure of joblessness that counts those not looking for work and holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged higher to 7%._

[Historic Context For Those Filing For Unemployment:](https://apnews.com/beb399767fd46f7264b43e07bf1cfeec) The nearly 1 million people who keep applying for unemployment aid each week point to a sluggish pace of improvement. **Before the pandemic struck the economy in March, the number of people seeking jobless aid had never topped 700,000 in a week, not even during the depths of the 2007-2009 Great Recession.** The economy has **recovered 9.3 million, or only 42%, of the jobs that were lost in March and April.**
