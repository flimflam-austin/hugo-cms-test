      <div><h2>What To Know</h2><ul><li>U.S. Abortion Laws Vary By
      State</li><li>1973: Supreme Court legalized abortion <strong>with
      limits</strong>; a woman’s right to an abortion is *not* absolute.
      Abortion is legal in first trimester, but states can regulate and even
      outlaw at certain points in pregnancy, *unless* there is a threat to the
      health/life of mother.</li><li>1992: Supreme Court ruled states can’t
      impose an “undue burden” on the right of a woman to obtain an
      abortion.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The 2020 Abortion Case</h2><ul><li>A 2014 Louisiana law requires
      abortion providers to have <strong>admitting privileges</strong> at a
      hospital w/in 30 miles of abortion site. It never took effect b/c of
      lawsuits.</li><li>The Supreme Court struck down a nearly identical Texas
      law in 2016, finding it imposed an <strong>“undue
      burden.”</strong></li><li>Supporters of the law said it was meant to
      <strong>protect</strong> women.</li><li>Opponents of the law said it was
      meant to <strong>limit access</strong> to abortion.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why The Case Matters</h2><ul><li>Although the facts of the case
      were similar to the 2016 Texas case, this was the first abortion case for
      the Court with <strong>Trump appointees</strong> on the bench.</li><li>The
      ruling comes just months before Americans passionate about the issue will
      vote for <strong>President</strong> (the person who appoints Supreme Court
      justices).</li><li>States like Arkansas, Alabama &amp; Indiana were
      waiting on the ruling before acting on <strong>further laws</strong>
      restricting abortion.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion
      just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons.
      Therefore Louisiana’s law cannot stand under our
      precedents.”</blockquote><p>Chief Justice John Roberts, who sided with the
      Court's liberal wing, on why he voted to block the law. Notably, he voted
      *in favor* of upholding the Texas law in 2016, but said he was bound by
      the legal doctrine of stare decisis - which requires judges to treat like
      cases alike, absent special circumstances.</p></div>

      <div><p>We're watching several existing challenges to state abortion laws,
      like Alabama, but none have yet reached the Supreme Court for the next
      term starting in the fall.</p><p></p></div>
