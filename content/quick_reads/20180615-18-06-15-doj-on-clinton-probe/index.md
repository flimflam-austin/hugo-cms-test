      ## WHY IT MATTERS:


      18-month investigation reveals how entangled FBI was in 2016 election.


      ConservativesA challenged the FBI’s trustworthiness, letting Clinton off
      the hook & Liberals blamed the bureau for mishandling the Clinton probe,
      costing her the election.


      **Bottom line:** Watchdog’s findings give neither side total vindication.

      The Inspector General's report made no recommendation of leveling any
      charges against Comey, but it gave both Democrats and Republicans plenty
      of ammunition to criticize him & the FBI. Click for what they are saying.
