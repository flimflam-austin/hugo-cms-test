      44%</strong>. Turnout usually approx. 60% <em>(that roughly matches voter
      turnout in America’s 2016 presidential election</em>).</li><li>First
      election since the start of the Iraq war (2003) whereA <strong>no bombings
      were reported at ANY polling site</strong>.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>No clear winner...yet. Once parliament is elected in Iraq (nearly
      400 seats), members have 3 months to form a government. A coalition of
      politicians backed by Muqtada Al-Sadr has an early lead. Sadr led a
      militia that fought/killed U.S. troops during Iraq War.</p><p><a
