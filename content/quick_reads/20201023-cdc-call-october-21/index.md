      ## “We all want to live as safely as we can.”


      CDC Deputy Dir. for Infectious Diseases Dr. Jay Butler says the following
      factors “translate” to higher risk:


      * The more closely you interact w/ others

      * The longer you interact w/ others

      * Indoor (vs outdoor) interaction

      * Interaction w/ larger number of people

      “…as we get more data and understand the science of COVID, we are going to
      continue to incorporate that in our recommendations.”  
        
      CDC Director Dr. Redfield on *updated* guidance. Previously, the CDC
      recommended quarantining if you came within 6 feet of someone with
      COVID-19 for more than 15 consecutive minutes. Now, the CDC defines "high
      risk" as including a series of shorter contacts that *add up* to more than
      15 minutes.

      “…(We are) concurrently manufacturing commercial scale production of all
      six of the vaccines that we have investments or contracts with.”


      HHS Sec. Alex Azar. The gov't says they believe at least one vaccine,
      maybe more, will be available before the end of the year, and emphasized
      Operation Warp Speed (the gov't program to invest in producing vaccines
      while trials are ongoing) will result in enough supply to start
      distributing the vaccine if and when it gets the green light from the FDA.

      ## VACCINE: WHO & WHEN


      Health & Human Services Sec. Azar gave this potential timeline – once a
      safe, effective vaccine is approved:


      * **By end of 2020**: enough vaccines for vulnerable individuals.

      * **By end of January**: enough vaccines for seniors and first responders.

      * **By end of March / early April**: enough vaccines for every American
      who wants one.

      "We get tired of wearing masks, but it continues to be as important as
      it’s ever been and I’d say it’s more important than ever as we move into
      the fall season.” Dr. Jay Butler. Alex Azar, Sec. of Health & Human
      Services, added the "3 W's": Wash your hands, watch your distance, and
      wear your face coverings.
