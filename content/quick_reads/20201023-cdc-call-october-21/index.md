      <div><h2>“We all want to live as safely as we can.”</h2><p>CDC Deputy Dir.
      for Infectious Diseases Dr. Jay Butler says the following factors
      “translate” to higher risk:</p><ul><li>The more closely you interact w/
      others</li><li>The longer you interact w/ others</li><li>Indoor (vs
      outdoor) interaction</li><li>Interaction w/ larger number of
      people</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>“…as we get more data and understand the science of COVID, we are
      going to continue to incorporate that in our recommendations.”<br><br>CDC
      Director Dr. Redfield on *updated* guidance. Previously, the CDC
      recommended quarantining if you came within 6 feet of someone with
      COVID-19 for more than 15 consecutive minutes. Now, the CDC defines "high
      risk" as including a series of shorter contacts that *add up* to more than
      15 minutes.</p><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>“…(We are) concurrently manufacturing commercial scale production
      of all six of the vaccines that we have investments or contracts
      with.”</p><p>HHS Sec. Alex Azar. The gov't says they believe at least one
      vaccine, maybe more, will be available before the end of the year, and
      emphasized Operation Warp Speed (the gov't program to invest in producing
      vaccines while trials are ongoing) will result in enough supply to start
      distributing the vaccine if and when it gets the green light from the
      FDA.</p></div>

      <div><h2>VACCINE: WHO &amp; WHEN</h2><p>Health &amp; Human Services Sec.
      Azar gave this potential timeline – once a safe, effective vaccine is
      approved:</p><ul><li><strong>By end of 2020</strong>: enough vaccines for
      vulnerable individuals.</li><li><strong>By end of January</strong>: enough
      vaccines for seniors and first responders.</li><li><strong>By end of March
      / early April</strong>: enough vaccines for every American who wants
      one.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>"We get tired of wearing masks, but it continues to be as
      important as it’s ever been and I’d say it’s more important than ever as
      we move into the fall season.” Dr. Jay Butler. Alex Azar, Sec. of Health
      &amp; Human Services, added the "3 W's": Wash your hands, watch your
      distance, and wear your face coverings.</p><p></p></div>
