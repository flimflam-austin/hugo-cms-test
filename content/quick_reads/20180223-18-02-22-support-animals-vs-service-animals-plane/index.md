      # Consider The Context


      ## Drama-Filled Month


      * In late January, a United Airlines passenger made national headlines
      when she tried to bring a peacock named Dexter on a flight as a “support”
      pet.

      * United denied the peacock a seat and a debate about “appropriate”
      support animals ensued.

      ## Why This Is Important


      > “United had been reviewing its policy since late last yearA afterA
      a**75% increase in emotional-support animals** on flightsA and ‘a
      significant increase in onboard incidents.’

      ## Why Is This Happening?


      **Possible Explanations**


      * Support pets, like service animals, fly free.

      * Support pets do not receive the same rigorous training as a “service”
      pet, which can lead to more “incidents.”

      * No hard firm rules about acceptable “comfort” animals on flights.

      ## Airlines: Reviewing Rules


      * Stricter regulations on “comfort” animals resisted by some who say
      increased documentation unfair to the truly disabled.

      * Current rules purposefully very broad;**spiders** are clearly NOT
      considered comfort pets, but did you know**miniature horses** are included
      in_The Americans with Disabilities Act_ as “service pets”?

      Just For Kicks: Dexter, the peacock, may not have "frequent flyer" miles
      but he has his own instagram account.

_Unlike service animals such as guide dogs, support animals need no training. However, passengers can be asked to show a medical professional”s note explaining why they need the animal to travel.A_ _Southwest started reviewing its policy even before Wednesday”s event, Ford said. Starting next week, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines will require more paperwork and assurances from owners of support animals.A_ _Both Delta and United said they have seen a sharp rise in the number of support animals in the last year or so. Last June, a 70-pound (32-kilogram) dog flying on Delta as a support animal bit a passenger in the face severely enough that the man required hospital care._
