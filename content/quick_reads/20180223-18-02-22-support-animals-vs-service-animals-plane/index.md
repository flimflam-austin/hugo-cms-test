      <div><h2>Why Is This Happening?</h2><p><strong>Possible
      Explanations</strong></p><ul><li>Support pets, like service animals, fly
      free.</li><li>Support pets do not receive the same rigorous training as a
      “service” pet, which can lead to more “incidents.”</li><li>No hard firm
      rules about acceptable “comfort” animals on flights.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Airlines: Reviewing Rules</h2><ul><li>Stricter regulations on
      “comfort” animals resisted by some who say increased documentation unfair
      to the truly disabled.</li><li>Current rules purposefully very broad;
      <strong>spiders</strong> are clearly NOT considered comfort pets, but did
      you know <strong>miniature horses</strong> are included in <em>The
      Americans with Disabilities Act</em> as “service pets”?</li></ul></div>

_Unlike service animals such as guide dogs, support animals need no training. However, passengers can be asked to show a medical professional”s note explaining why they need the animal to travel.A_ _Southwest started reviewing its policy even before Wednesday”s event, Ford said. Starting next week, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines will require more paperwork and assurances from owners of support animals.A_ _Both Delta and United said they have seen a sharp rise in the number of support animals in the last year or so. Last June, a 70-pound (32-kilogram) dog flying on Delta as a support animal bit a passenger in the face severely enough that the man required hospital care._
