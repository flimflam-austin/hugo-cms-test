      <blockquote>"You can certainly hurt your hearing listening to loud music,
      whether through earbuds or something else. But earbuds and listening to
      music with earbuds are not a major cause of hearing loss."<br><br><br>Dr.
      Robert Dobie, clinical professor of otolaryngology at the University of
      Texas Health Science Center. One of Dr. Dobie's March 2017 studies found
      rates of hearing loss have actually fallen among adults aged
      20-69.</blockquote>

      <div><p>Which headphones are safest? Experts recommend noise-canceling
      ones, especially in loud places. You're less apt to crank up music to
      drown out background noise, but experts warn they're not a good option
      when you need to hear outdoor sounds - like when running.</p><p><a
