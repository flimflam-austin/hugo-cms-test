      > “I’ve never been to school. I grew up homeschooled, stayed homeschooled,
      never was not homeschooled.”


      Grammy-winning recording artist Billie Eilish. The 18-year-old and her
      producer/collaborator brother, Finneas O'Connell, both have spoken
      supportively of their homeschool experience. Their father says he was
      inspired to homeschool after learning that Hanson, a successful music trio
      of brothers, didn't attend traditional school.

      until**1918**.

      right to educate at home. Homeschooling did not become legal in every
      state until**1993**.

      * From**1999 to 2016**, the number of homeschooled students nearly doubled
      to 1.6 million.

      “Real life isn’t broken up into subjects or class periods; it comes to you
      as a whole. I want to foster a real love for learning in my kids; I want
      them to fall in love with knowledge for its own sake, to cherish their
      gifts and run with them, and to want to dive into creative challenges
      without feeling stuck in a grade level or a box.”

      models), and social networks for kids.
