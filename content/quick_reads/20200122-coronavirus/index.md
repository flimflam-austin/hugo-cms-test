      CDC announcing the first case of a new coronavirus infection in a man who
      traveled back to Washington state last week from China. The virus first
      surfaced in an animal market in Wuhan, a central Chinese city, in
      December. The "Wuhan coronavirus" is blamed for at least 6 deaths in China
      and hundreds sick across Asia.

      ## “Coronavirus”


      * Virus causing respiratory illness.

      * Coronavirus = an umbrella virus family causing a range of illnesses from
      common cold symptoms to SARs.

      * “Wuhan” coronavirus symptoms: fever, cough, difficulty breathing, can
      lead to pneumonia.

      * Victims with this new strain show varying degree of illness; the CDC
      calls the man hospitalized in Washington state “very healthy.”

      Linfa Wang, virologist at Duke-National University of Singapore, speaking
      about the unknowns of this illness - specifically how it's spread, making
      it difficult to strategize about containment. There's heightened concern
      about the Lunar New Year this weekend, when many people across Asia will
      travel.

      The CDC is now screening for the illness in some major U.S. international
      airports: San Francisco (SFO), Los Angeles (LAX), NY (JFK) and now
      additionally Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD). The last time such efforts
      were made? 2014 over concerns for Ebola.
