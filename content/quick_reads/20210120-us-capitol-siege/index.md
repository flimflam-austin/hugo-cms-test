      <div><blockquote>“This is an unprecedented incident. If this investigation
      was a football game, we’d still be in the first
      quarter.”</blockquote><p>FBI Assistant Director in Charge Steven M.
      D’Antuono speaking last week. As the many investigations continue, law
      enforcement has requested the public's assistance. To date, the FBI alone
      has received countless tips and over 140,000 photos and videos.</p></div>
