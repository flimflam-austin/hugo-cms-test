      ## Pres. Lincoln’s “Support”


      * **Catafalque:** a frame that supports a coffin (cat-e-falk).

      * Pres. Lincoln’s catafalque from 1865 has held most of the coffins that
      have lain in state.

      * The catafalque has had minor restorations since 1865 (retrofitted to
      hold larger coffins, drapery replaced), but for the most part, it remains
      like the original.

      ## “In State” vs. “In Honor”


      Average citizens cannot**“lay in state”** as that honor is reserved
      for_**gov’t & military** officials.


      However,**eminent private citizens** may**“lay in honor.”**


      To date, only four have received the honor, including Rev. Billy Graham &
      two police officers killed during an attack on the U.S. Capitol.
