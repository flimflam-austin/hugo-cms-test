      ## The Background


      * Congress passed the 15th Amendment in 1870 to guarantee that the right
      to vote _“shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any
      state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”_

      * However, many states passed laws or employed practices that still
      limited access for some voters – i.e. poll taxes, literacy exams, fraud,
      and intimidation.

      ## “Bloody Sunday”


      * Approx. 600 nonviolent activists planned to march 54 miles from Selma to
      Montgomery, AL as a protest for African-American voting rights.

      * They made it only 6 blocks, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge – where
      law enforcement ordered the march to stop & disperse.

      * Armed officers, many in gas masks, beat and tear-gassed protesters.

      * Photographers captured the violent scene, broadcast around the world.

      ## Aftermath


      In the days that followed, 80 cities around the nation held demonstrations
      in support of the protestors.


      Faith & civil rights leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., flew
      to Selma.


      3 weeks later, under the protection of thousands of soldiers (& federal
      agents), 3000+ set out to march from Selma to Montgomery. Ultimately,
      25,000 marchers arrived.

      into every section and State of America … And we shall overcome.”


      Pres. Lyndon Johnson in the days following the march. Months later, he
      signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, which many see as a direct
      legislative action in response to "Bloody Sunday." The law prohibits
      literacy tests and requires federal oversight over any other local laws
      that could lead to limiting voting rights.

      > “There are more bridges to cross, but we will make it … ​I just believe
      deeply within it’s just a matter of time, that fate and history will come
      together. And we will get there.”


      The late U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) in 2019 discussing "Bloody Sunday."
      Rep. Lewis, who died in July 2020 at the age of 80, was brutally beaten
      that day. He spent his career in public service advocating for racial
      equality; this is the first Sunday in 56 years he will not be present to
      mark the day in person.

      In 2013 the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after a Confederate general, was
      designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark to honor the events of
      Bloody Sunday. In recent years, there's been a movement to rename the
      bridge; these efforts gained further steam after Rep. John Lewis' death in
      2020.
