      compassion, then it will start a chain reaction of the same. People will
      never know how far a little kindness can go."_

      17-yr-old Rachel Scott was the first out of 12 students & one staff member
      killed at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. Excerpts of her
      posthumously-published journals recounted her journey of faith and
      inspired a film. An early intervention campaign called "Rachel's
      Challenge" has encouraged millions to connect and kick off a "chain
      reaction" through random acts of kindness.
