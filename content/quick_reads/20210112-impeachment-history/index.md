      <div><h1>Historical Context<br>For Historic Times</h1><p>As Congress gets
      ready to vote on whether to impeach President Trump (for the second time),
      a look at how past is precedent.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote><em>“The President, Vice President and all civil officers
      of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and
      conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
      misdemeanors.”</em></blockquote><p>Article II, Section 4 of the U.S.
      Constitution. The founders purposely left "high crimes" open-ended for
      Congress to decide. Consequently, the power of removing the U.S. president
      falls to the people's representatives.</p></div>

      <div><h2>How It Works:</h2><ul><li>The House of Representatives can vote
      for impeachment, but only the Senate can convict.</li><li>House Judiciary
      Cmte. drafts “articles of impeachment” (charges); simple majority is
      needed to impeach in the House.</li><li>The Senate holds impeachment
      proceedings (trial). Conviction (removal from office) requires a 2/3
      supermajority (67 of 100).</li></ul></div>

      impeachment resolution in the House of
      Representatives.</li><li>Resolutions differed depending on the president,
      and some never became serious movements by the House to *actually* impeach
      the president.</li><li>In 2019, Pres. Trump became the third president to
      be impeached by the House.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Pres. Andrew Johnson</h2><ul><li><strong>Impeached by House in
      1868</strong>, but avoided removal from office by a single Senate
      vote.</li><li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Johnson served out the remainder
      of his term as president and was later re-elected to the
      Senate.</li><li><strong>Context</strong>: Pres. Johnson was the first
      president impeached by the House. 25 years earlier, Pres. Tyler was the
      first president to face an impeachment attempt by Congress; it quickly
      failed.</li></ul></div>

      impeachment. Republicans lost public support – and House seats – during
      the impeachment process.</li><li><strong>Context</strong>: Neither the
