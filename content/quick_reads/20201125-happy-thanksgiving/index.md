      # What Did They Eat?


      ## First Thanksgiving Feast


      Pigeons potentially served alongside turkey…venison instead of ham…maybe a
      side of eel…but definitely…  

      **NO PIE.**

      > “… no, the pastry isn’t there. That is a blank in the table, for an
      English eye … So what are they putting on instead? I think meat, meat and
      more meat.”


      Kathleen Wall, culinarian at the Plimoth Plantation -- a "living museum"
      in Massachusetts where the Pilgrims landed accidentally in 1620 --
      explains that they were lacking butter and flour to make pie crust. Their
      first Thanksgiving in 1621 celebrated surviving their first year in a new
      land.

      ## MAJOR MEATS


      * Surviving letters from the time period describe hunts for “wild fowl” —
      likely**wild turkey**, geese, duck, and potentially flocks of passenger
      pigeons.

      * **Venison** (aka DEER) meat was contributed by local Native Americans,
      the Wampanoag Indians, who helped teach the pilgrims how to hunt, fish &
      harvest the area of modern-day Cape Cod.

      “Godey’s Lady’s Book,” where she wrote about American issues & customs.

      Hale's work paid off. A letter to Pres. Lincoln in Sept. 1863 is thought
      to have inspired his proclamation to make Thanksgiving a national holiday
      on November's third Thursday. He did this during the Civil War in 1863
      (the same year he delivered the Gettysburg Address) as a way to unify the
      country around a common history. Read Hale's letter here:

**Proclamation of Thanksgiving**  
_I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens._
