      # Take Me Out to the Ballgame.


      ## (…Actually, Nevermind.)

      the season.

      WHAT’S TO BLAME?  

      MLB is Trying to Find Out


      * **Cost?** Avg ticket price in MLB is $32, but on the re-sale market
      (i.e. StubHub) it’s $76. Add food & drinks, that’s approx $100 for 1 fan.

      * **Less Competition?A** Handful of really good teams & really bad teams
      makes for less thrill. Strikeouts topped hits in April.

      * **No incentive?** Fans can watch anywhere – phone, tablet, TV.

      ## WHY THIS MATTERS


      * **MLB attendance is pretty consistent**, swinging no more than 2% in
      either direction.

      * Baseball hasn’t seen a**drop like this since 1995** following a player
      strike which canceled the World Series.

      * Empty stadiums may give you a better shot at catching a foul ball,
      but**not an ideal setting to watch a game.**

      ## MLB WANTS TO FIX IT


      > ‘I think that a lot of us in the game are watching the way we’re playing
      very, very closely, everything from fewer hits, more strikeouts, more
      times between balls in play.”
