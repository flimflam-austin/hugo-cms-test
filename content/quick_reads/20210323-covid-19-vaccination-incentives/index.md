      pay, some companies offer incentives for you to get the COVID-19

      <div><blockquote><br>“Krispy Kreme is finding ways to be sweet as the U.S.
      continues to scale COVID-19 vaccinations.”</blockquote><p>Krispy Kreme's
      latest incentive includes one free glazed doughnut to those who show their
      COVID-19 vaccination records. Those who qualify can receive one doughnut a
      day, no purchase necessary. Food for thought: the CDC says weight is a
      factor for incidence of severity with COVID-19; obesity may put people at
      triple the risk of hospitalization.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Generally, providing an incentive is a legal method for
      employers to encourage vaccination…”</blockquote><p>The National Law
      Review writes that private businesses *can* legally require vaccinations
      (with exceptions for those who decline) – and advises incentives need
      exceptions, too. For example, Krispy Kreme is offering a free coffee and
      doughnut for anyone on Mondays during this campaign, even without a
      vaccination record.</p></div>

      <div><h2><br>BIG PICTURE</h2><ul><li><strong>Incentives for customers
      w/proof of the COVID-19 vaccine are rare *so far*</strong>: Krispy Kreme
      is the first major U.S. brand to offer something *to customers* on a
      national level.</li><li><strong>Incentives for employees to receive the
      vaccine are on the rise</strong>: often in the form of bonus pay for
      stores like Kroger, Trader Joe’s, &amp; Dollar General. Target’s includes
      bonus pay and $ for a ride to and from the vaccination
      site.</li></ul></div>

      <blockquote><br>Businesses are offering everything from gift cards, to
      discounts on purchases, and even "joints for jabs" - yes, you read that
      correctly: pre-rolled marijuana joints for those with proof of
      vaccination. Instead of quoting from the experts, we wanted to toss this
      question to YOU: Will these incentives be effective? What do you think of
      them?</blockquote>
