      <blockquote><strong>“To be a feminist, to be a lady, to be a president, to
      be a woman does not mean fighting against the stereotype of gender roles,
      but embracing the idea that one can rule a country and wear lipstick; be a
      breadwinner at work, and a bread baker with her kids at
      home.”</strong><br><br>Markle, to the Irish Independent in 2014, on why
      feminity and feminism are not mutially exclusive.</blockquote>

      <blockquote><strong>“While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area
      surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides
      of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where
      I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race
      woman.”</strong><br><br><br>Markle, to Elle Magazine in 2015, on her
      biracial identity.</blockquote>

      <div><blockquote><strong>“If we just talk to ourselves the way we talk to
      our best friends…. It’s like having the best cheerleader ever with you,
      which helps you get through any of those work hurdles, or those life
      hurdles, because you always have yourself championing
      yourself.”</strong><br><br>Markle, in an interview at the 2016 Create
      &amp; Cultivate conference, on being kind to yourself.</blockquote><p><a
