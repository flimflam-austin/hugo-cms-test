      <div><h2>Backstory</h2><ul><li>New study focuses on transmission of the
      virus that causes COVID-19 in a hair salon in Springfield,
      Missouri.</li><li><strong>Stylist A</strong> developed respiratory
      symptoms. She took a COVID-19 test on day 6 of her illness but kept
      working with clients for 8 days, when her test came back
      positive.</li><li><strong>Stylist B</strong> developed symptoms, and
      worked for 5 days before self-isolating and testing positive 2 days
      later.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>What Happened</h2><ul><li>139 clients, ranging from 21 to
      93-years-old, were exposed to the two stylists.</li><li>Both stylists wore
      masks throughout the 15-45 minute appointments, as did nearly all of the
      clients.</li><li><strong>No clients reported COVID-19 symptoms in the
      following weeks.</strong> About half agreed to be officially tested – zero
      tested positive for SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes
      COVID-19).</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><p>While both stylists wore masks
      *during* client appointments, they did not wear masks *between*
      appointments when interacting with each other.</p><ul><li>Stylist A’s
      contacts developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 (her husband,
      daughter, son-in-law and roommate).</li><li>Stylist B’s contacts did not
      develop symptoms.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why This Matters?</h2><ul><li>As states start to “shut down”
      their economies during an increase in infections, this new report suggests
      masks may help <em>“to reduce the impact and magnitude of additional waves
      of COVID-19”</em> according to the CDC.</li><li><strong>However</strong>,
      the CDC notes scientists don’t fully understand how SARS-COV-2 is
      transmitted &amp; researchers did not track clients who interacted with
      stylists BEFORE symptoms.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Important: Not all clients had on the same masks - some had cloth,
      other had medical masks. The stylists all wore cloth
      masks.</p><p></p></div>
