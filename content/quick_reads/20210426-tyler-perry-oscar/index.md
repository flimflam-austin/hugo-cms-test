      That’s where conversation happens. That’s where change happens. It happens

Following his acceptance speech he said:_   
  
"...everybody is grabbing a corner and a color... nobody wants to come to the middle to have a conversation. Everybody is polarized, and it's in the middle where things change. So I'm hoping that that inspires people to meet us in the middle so that we can get back to some semblance of normal. As this pandemic is over, we can get to a place where we are showing love and kindness to each other again."_
