      “If you let your whiskers grow, I will try and get the rest of them to
      vote for you. You would look a great deal better for your face is so thin.
      All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote
      for you and then you would be President.”  
        
      11-year-old Grace Bedell of Westfield, NY writing to then-candidate
      Abraham Lincoln during his presidential campaign. Shortly after, Lincoln
      started growing a beard and he had a full beard on the day of his
      inauguration several months later.

      > “Some three months ago, I received a letter from a young lady here; it
      was a very pretty letter, and she advised me to let my whiskers grow, as
      it would improve my personal appearance; acting partly upon her
      suggestion, I have done so; and now, if she is here, I would like to see
      her.”


      President-Elect Lincoln during a brief stop in Westfield, NY on the way to
      his inauguration celebration in 1861.

      ## Guided By Grace?


      Grace wrote the letter in Oct 1860, just weeks before Election Day.


      In his response to Grace, Lincoln asked whether he might be made fun of
      for suddenly growing a beard; he was!


      The beard likely didn’t impact his victory, BUT it did affect his
      appearance as the 16th President and his legacy.

      Pres. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have one thing going for
      both of them this Election Day — NO facial hair. Researchers say beards
      are perceived as a sign of masculinity and self-confidence, yet no sitting
      president has sported facial hair in over a century.
