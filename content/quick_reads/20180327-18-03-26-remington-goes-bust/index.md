      ## Why Now?


      * **Slumping sales** year-over-year (dropped 30% in 2017)

      * **Mounting debt** ($100M – $500M)

      * Private equity firm that owns Remington has been trying to sell it for
      years, but never found buyer.

      * **High-profile case:** Remington waiting on big ruling on whether victim
      families of the Sandy Hook school shooting can sue because shooter used a
      Remington gun.

      ## To Blame? “Trump Slump”


      * Prior to election of President Trump, gun sales spiked because those who
      expected Hillary Clinton to win (with a platform of stricter gun control)
      bought weapons in advance of election.

      * With gun control NOT a big part of President Trump’s platform, buyers
      are less motivated.

      ## Fact Check: AR-15


      * “AR” does **NOT** stand for “automatic rifle” or “assault rifle.”

      * AR = stands for ArmaLite.

      * AR-15 = a specific model of a semi-auto rifle produced by ArmaLite.
      Other gun makers have their own model numbers for similar style weapons.A
      **Though often used as a general term, an ‘AR’ is a specific gun by a
      specific company.A**
