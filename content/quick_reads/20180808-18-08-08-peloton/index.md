      ## The Basics


      * Pronounced: Pel-**O**-t-**ON**.

      * **Video-streaming stationary bike co**. launched in 2012.

      * **The draw?** Get on the bike, turn on the screen & you can instantly
      take live or on-demand classes.

      * **The catch?** Spin bicycle equipped w/22-inch touch-screen costs $1,995
      & need to pay $39/month for content on the screen.

      ## The Bigger Picture


      * Peloton wants to make itself a public-traded company on Wall St. which
      says its **worth $4B+**.

      * For perspective, that’s **more than Dick’s Sporting Goods** ($3.5B).

      * CEO argues it’s a **“media company”** not just exercise equipment due to
      its **subscription-based model** (a la Netflix.)

      ## Reinventing the Wheel?


      Exercise using a stationary bicycle is nothing new. In fact, first
      rudimentary version **created in 1796**.


      It wasn’t until the 1960s when **Schwinn released the “Exerciser”** that
      the bike exercise fad caught on.


      Today,A **stationary bikes are everywhere**, even the International Space
      Station.

      Peloton is taking pre-orders for a treadmill "Peloton Tread" with the same
      features. The CEO says he wants users who don't own a Peloton bike to
      access workouts on your phone & tablets. What do you think...exercise fad
      or does Peloton have staying power?
