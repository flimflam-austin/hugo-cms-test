      # A RIGHT TO TRY


      “… thousands of terminally ill Americans will finally have the help, the
      hope, and the fighting chance … that they will be cured, that they will be
      helped, that they’ll be able to be with their families for a long time.”  
        
      Pres. Trump at the May 30 signing of the 'Right to Try' bill, aimed at
      helping the 1M+ terminally ill patients who die each year access drugs
      pending final FDA approval.

      ## The ‘Right To Try’ Law


      * Allows terminally ill patients in the 12 states w/o a ‘Right to Try law’
      to sidestep the FDA.

      * Now, patients can reach out to directly to drug manufacturers in order
      to participate in clinical trials & access experimental drugs.

      * Drug must pass FDA approval phase #1.

      * Eliminates existing FDA application requirements.

      ## Something To Consider


      **“Right to Try” does NOT guarantee ACCESS or AFFORDABILITY**


      * Insurance companies are NOT required to cover experimental treatments.

      * Drug manufacturers are NOT mandated to undergo clinical trials OR
      provide experimental drugs OR produce large enough amt of drugs to ensure
      availability.

      authorizes over 99% of expanded access requests it receives. But for some,
      it's still not fast enough. Read more about the program here:

> In October 2017, Scott Gottlieb, the FDA Commissioner before the Subcommittee on Health, Committee on Energy and Commerce, US House of Representatives about efforts to expand access to investigational drugs and biologics for terminally ill patients, saying:  
  
  
  
“_In recent years, FDA has received over 1,000 applications annually for expanded access to treat patients with investigational drugs and biologics. FDA authorizes 99 percent of these requests. Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days_.”
