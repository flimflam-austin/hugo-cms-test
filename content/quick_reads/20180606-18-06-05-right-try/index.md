> In October 2017, Scott Gottlieb, the FDA Commissioner before the Subcommittee on Health, Committee on Energy and Commerce, US House of Representatives about efforts to expand access to investigational drugs and biologics for terminally ill patients, saying:  
  
  
  
“_In recent years, FDA has received over 1,000 applications annually for expanded access to treat patients with investigational drugs and biologics. FDA authorizes 99 percent of these requests. Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days_.”
