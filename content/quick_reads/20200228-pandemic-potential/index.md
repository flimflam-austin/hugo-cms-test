      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><ul><li>The new coronavirus (named
      <strong>COVID-19</strong>) was first detected in Wuhan, China in December
      2019.</li><li>By January, the World Health Org. (WHO) declared it an int’l
      emergency.</li><li>COVID-19 has infected <strong>82,000+</strong> and
      killed <strong>2,800+</strong> in 4<strong>0+</strong> countries to
      date.</li><li>There are now more <strong>*new*</strong> cases being
      reported from outside of China than from China, leading the WHO to discuss
      its <strong>“pandemic potential.”</strong></li></ul></div>

      worldwide spread of a new disease</strong>.”</li><li>The definition is
      based on the global spread of a disease – <strong>NOT its
      severity</strong>.</li><li>WHO’s Director General determines whether or
      not to declare a pandemic based on “an ongoing assessment of the
      geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and
      the impact it has on the whole society.”</li><li>Recent example: 2009 H1N1
      (swine flu).</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic without
      a careful and clear-minded analysis of the facts.”</blockquote><p>WHO's
      Director General says that despite the rising number of cases, we
      shouldn't refer to COVID-19 as a pandemic. He says calling it a "pandemic
      carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in
      terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and
      paralyzing systems. It may also signal that we can no longer contain the
      virus, which is not true."</p></div>

      <div><h2>Are We Prepared?</h2><p>The 2019 Global Health Security Index
      looked at how prepared 195 countries are to prevent, detect, and respond
      to major infectious disease outbreaks. The results:</p><ul><li>No country
      (not even the U.S) is *<strong>fully*</strong> prepared for a
      pandemic.</li><li>U.S. scored far higher than the avg. overall score,
      <strong>*but*</strong> our ability to prevent the spread of an outbreak
      also depends on other countries’ abilities.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>
