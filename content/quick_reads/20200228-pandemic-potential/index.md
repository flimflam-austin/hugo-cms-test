      ## “PANDEMIC POTENTIAL”


      > The new coronavirus has  

      “pandemic potential.”  
        
      Here’s what a pandemic is…what’s it’s not…and whether the U.S. is ready
      for one.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * The new coronavirus (named**COVID-19**) was first detected in Wuhan,
      China in December 2019.

      * By January, the World Health Org. (WHO) declared it an int’l emergency.

      * COVID-19 has infected**82,000+** and killed**2,800+** in 4**0+**
      countries to date.

      * There are now more***new*** cases being reported from outside of China
      than from China, leading the WHO to discuss its**“pandemic potential.”**

      ## What’s A Pandemic?


      * WHO defines it as “**the worldwide spread of a new disease**.”

      * The definition is based on the global spread of a disease –**NOT its
      severity**.

      * WHO’s Director General determines whether or not to declare a pandemic
      based on “an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus,
      the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole
      society.”

      * Recent example: 2009 H1N1 (swine flu).

      > “We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic without a careful and
      clear-minded analysis of the facts.”


      WHO's Director General says that despite the rising number of cases, we
      shouldn't refer to COVID-19 as a pandemic. He says calling it a "pandemic
      carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in
      terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and
      paralyzing systems. It may also signal that we can no longer contain the
      virus, which is not true."

      ## Are We Prepared?


      The 2019 Global Health Security Index looked at how prepared 195 countries
      are to prevent, detect, and respond to major infectious disease outbreaks.
      The results:


      * No country (not even the U.S) is ***fully*** prepared for a pandemic.

      * U.S. scored far higher than the avg. overall score,***but*** our ability
      to prevent the spread of an outbreak also depends on other countries’
      abilities.

      “All countries—at all income levels—have major gaps in their capabilities,
      and they aren’t sufficiently investing in biological preparedness…. The
      bottom line is that global biological risks are growing—in many cases
      faster than health systems, security, science, and governments can keep
      up.”


      Nuclear Threat Initiative Co-Chair and CEO Ernest J. Moniz on the results
      of the 2019 Global Health Security Index.

      BIG PICTURE: While approximately 60 Americans are confirmed to have
      COVID-19, none have died. More than 16,000 have died from the flu since
      October.
