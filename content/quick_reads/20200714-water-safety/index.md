      “There are a lot of currents on the lake that appear typically in the
      afternoon. We believe it was mid-afternoon when she disappeared, the idea

      mustered enough energy to get her son back onto the boat, but not enough
      to save herself.”

      California lake.

      Especially as we seek social distance activities outdoors due to COVID-19:
      P.A.U.S.E. BEFORE YOU DIP YOUR TOES IN: Pay attention to signs and caution
      warnings. Avoid night swimming. Use life jackets or flotation devices when
      possible. Swim with at least one other adult. Enjoy alcoholic beverages
