      ### A traffic jam in the “world’s most important waterway” may have you
      running into delays and/or higher prices.

      ## What’s Going On?


      A gigantic ship got stuck in Suez Canal.


      * **Not just any ship:** The Ever Given, one of the largest cargo ships in
      the world. Stand it up and it would be nearly as tall as the Empire State
      Building.

      * **Not just any canal:** This man-made canal is a link between the Middle
      East & Europe, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Dozens of ships
      sail through daily, carrying everything from oil to electronics to
      shampoo.

      # How Did This Happen?


      TBD. Initial reports: bad weather (wind/dust/poor visibility) at a
      precarious spot in the canal.


      The canal narrows at certain points which require single-direction travel.


      The Ever Given is stuck in a narrow pass, almost perpendicular to the
      canal & touching or nearly touching each bank – effectively blocking the
      canal entirely.

      ## Why Does This Matter?


      **Global trade delays**: About 50 ships move through this canal every day.
      Now 150+ are stuck, waiting for the waterway to clear.  
        
      Even if the ship is “free” by the time you read this report, the ripple
      effect of delays adds another variable to an already-stressed supply chain
      trying to get back on track during the pandemic.

      > So what would it take to "go around" (Africa) and not use the canal?
      About 15 days, according to one estimate. And remember - it's not just
      manufactured goods that are potentially delayed, but also the parts used
      to make goods. Analysts say this event will have an effect; how BIG of an
      effect remains TBD.
