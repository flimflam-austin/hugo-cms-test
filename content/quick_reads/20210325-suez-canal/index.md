      <div><h2>What’s Going On?</h2><p>A gigantic ship got stuck in Suez
      Canal.</p><ul><li><strong>Not just any ship:</strong> The Ever Given, one
      of the largest cargo ships in the world. Stand it up and it would be
      nearly as tall as the Empire State Building.</li><li><strong>Not just any
      canal:</strong> This man-made canal is a link between the Middle East
      &amp; Europe, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Dozens of ships
      sail through daily, carrying everything from oil to electronics to
      shampoo.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h1>How Did This Happen?</h1><p>TBD. Initial reports: bad weather
      (wind/dust/poor visibility) at a precarious spot in the canal.</p><p>The
      canal narrows at certain points which require single-direction
      travel.</p><p>The Ever Given is stuck in a narrow pass, almost
      perpendicular to the canal &amp; touching or nearly touching each bank –
      effectively blocking the canal entirely.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2><p><strong>Global trade
      delays</strong>: About 50 ships move through this canal every day. Now
      150+ are stuck, waiting for the waterway to clear.<br><br>Even if the ship
      is “free” by the time you read this report, the ripple effect of delays
      adds another variable to an already-stressed supply chain trying to get
      back on track during the pandemic.</p></div>

      <blockquote>So what would it take to "go around" (Africa) and not use the
      canal? About 15 days, according to one estimate. And remember - it's not
      just manufactured goods that are potentially delayed, but also the parts
      used to make goods. Analysts say this event will have an effect; how BIG
      of an effect remains TBD.</blockquote>
