      ## But…Why Did Pasta Lead To Weight Loss?


      Researchers aren’t 100% sure…but say :_“lower-GI foods have been shown to
      be**more satiating** and**delay hunger** and**decrease subsequent energy
      intake.**_


      Translation?**A little pasta may have made eaters feel fuller, longer.**
