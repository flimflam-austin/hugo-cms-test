      <div><h2>What’s the Problem?</h2><p>The U.S. food supply chain is impacted
      by COVID-19 in these two ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Distribution:</strong>
      Restaurants, cafeterias, closed, immediately halting
      demand.</li><li><strong>Human Power:</strong> When plants shut down due to
      illness/sick leave, fewer workers can process
      food.</li></ul><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Livestock farmers have
      too much product &amp; nowhere to send it.</p></div>

      production. U.S. meat industry workers have reportedly died from
      COVID-19.</li><li>This has led to the closure of <strong>major</strong>
      U.S. meat processing plants, potentially impacting meat supply nationwide

      for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from
      the supply chain… Farmers across the country will not have anywhere to
      sell their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation…
      The food supply chain is breaking.”</p><p>Tyson Foods chairman John Tyson

      cannot be repackaged and sold in grocery stores, or donated easily. The
