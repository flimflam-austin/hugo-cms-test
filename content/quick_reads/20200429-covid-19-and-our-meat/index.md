      ## THE STAKES (& STEAKS)


      * The U.S. is the world’s largest **food** exporter.

      * The U.S. is the world’s largest **beef** producer & consumer in the
      world.

      * The U.S. is the world’s largest **poultry** producer. It’s also a major
      egg producer & the second largest poultry exporter.

      * Meat **byproducts** (ex: gelatin, wool, lanolin) also contribute to many
      commonly used household products.

      ## What’s the Problem?


      The U.S. food supply chain is impacted by COVID-19 in these two ways:


      * **Distribution:** Restaurants, cafeterias, closed, immediately halting
      demand.

      * **Human Power:** When plants shut down due to illness/sick leave, fewer
      workers can process food.


      **Why It Matters:** Livestock farmers have too much product & nowhere to
      send it.

      ## THE LATEST


      * The U.S. gov’t considers livestock, agriculture workers “critical.”

      * Large processing plants employ a lot of people working in close
      quarters.

      * Outbreaks have halted production. U.S. meat industry workers have
      reportedly died from COVID-19.

      * This has led to the closure of **major** U.S. meat processing plants,
      potentially impacting meat supply nationwide (and beyond).

      “As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for
      short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the
      supply chain… Farmers across the country will not have anywhere to sell
      their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation… The
      food supply chain is breaking.”

      newspapers over the weekend.

      > “They say, ‘How dare you throw away food when so many people are
      hungry?.’ They don’t know how farming works. This makes me sick, too.”


      A U.S. farmer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, about disposing of
      their product. Some farmers have been forced to euthanize livestock
      because they have nowhere to keep or sell the animals.

      ## What This Means For You


      Even if individual families buy more at the grocery store, we can’t make
      up for the large, bulk purchasing power of restaurants, corporate
      cafeterias, event catering and beyond.


      Some economists believe the disruption in the supply chain (lower supply
      due to closed processing plants) will lead to higher prices for all in the
      weeks and months ahead.

      Currently, meat produced for food-service (like restaurants) cannot be
      repackaged and sold in grocery stores, or donated easily. The USDA has set
      up an emergency network to try to coordinate oversupply, funneling it to
      places of need.
