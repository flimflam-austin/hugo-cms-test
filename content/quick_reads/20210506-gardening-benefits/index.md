      <div><blockquote>"This is the first time the 'dose response' to gardening
      has been tested and the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the more
      frequently you garden - the greater the health benefits. In fact gardening
      every day has the same positive impact on wellbeing than undertaking
      regular, vigorous exercise like cycling or running."</blockquote><p>Lead
      author Dr. Lauriane Chalmin-Pui, Royal Horticultural Society (RHS)
      wellbeing fellow, on a new study <em>"Why garden? – Attitudes and the
      perceived health benefits of home gardening."</em></p></div>

      Maine seed &amp; supply company founded in 1978, describing the insatiable
      demand for online seed purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic as Americans
      stayed closer to home. Kavanya says online orders this February typically

      <div><p>Consider the Source:</p><p>The UK's Royal Horticultural Society,
      the study's sponsor, is "the world's leading gardening charity." That
      doesn't mean the study isn't useful or interesting, but it's always
      important to know the "root" (pun intended!) of the research.</p></div>
