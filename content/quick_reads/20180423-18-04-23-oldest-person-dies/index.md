Manami Inoue, a professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Tokyo and Project Professor, AXA Department of Health and Human Security, studies the factors that contribute to long life in Japan. In 2016, she told Scientific American:

_Genetic factors appear only to play a small role when it comes to life expectancy, and lifestyle seems to be much more important …._

_For example, Japanese women live longer thanks to their healthy lifestyle, which includes a better diet a\u0013 especially for those over 50. The Japanese also consume less meat and animal fats than Westerners in general and eat more fish._

_Japanese women over 50 also drink much less alcohol than their male folk, and hardly ever smoke, which means that they are half as likely to develop stomach or liver cancers compared to men. Drinking less alcohol also reduces the risk of developing colorectal and breast cancers for women_.
