      # “Ordered Departure”


      America evacuated a consulate in **Iraq**…. And it has everything to do

      ## The Basics


      A “_While the United States has only **one embassy** and **one
      ambassador** in the capital of any foreign country, in large countries it
      may have several consulates.”_ (U.S. State Dept)


      America maintains its embassy in Baghdad while the consulate in Basra
      (southern Iraq) is closed.


      WHY NOW?

      ## Protests & Threats


      * Public protests vs. Iraqi gov’t have raged in Basra -A an oil rich
      region where Iraqi citizens don’t often have electricity or clean water.
      **BasraA** **shares border with Iran**.

      * Protesters set fire to the Iranian consulate; Iran has close
      relationship with Iraqi gov’t.

      * Iran blamed U.S. for protests & fired rockets at consulate (no one was
      injured) as recently as **Friday**.

      > “I have made clear that Iran should understand that the United States
      will respond promptly and appropriately to any such attacks.”  
        
      Sec. of State Mike Pompeo in a statement on the "temporary relocation" of
      U.S. diplomats in Iraq after squarely blaming Iran for attacks and threats
      against American lives. Pompeo said "incidents" have increased over the
      last several weeks in Basra and Baghdad.

      ## Big Picture: Tensions High


      * Iran vowed retaliation vs. U.S. for attack on Iranian military parade
      (says U.S. behind attack).

      * America will levy more sanctions on Iran, a state sponsor of terror, in
      coming weeks for allegedly pursuing nuclear weapons; Iranian leadership
      says U.S. guilty of economic terrorism.

      * Both countries threatening each other.

      Iran's close relationship with the Iraqi gov't raises questions about
      future U.S. diplomatic missions inside Iraq, where 4,400+ U.S. soldiers
      have died. The U.S. fears increased tensions between the 2 countries will
      turn deadly.
