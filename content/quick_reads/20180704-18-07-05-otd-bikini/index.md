      a <strong>Frenchman, Louis Reard.</strong></li><li>Named after a nuclear
      test site <strong>off the Bikini Atoll in Pacific
      Ocean.</strong></li><li>No Parisian model would wear his revealing design
      so <strong>he got a nude dancer to model it</strong>.</li><li>NOT the
      first 2-piece swimsuit, but theA <strong>firstA to show
      navel.</strong></li><li>Banned in numerous countries, Vatican called it
      sinful.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Less is Much, Much More</h2><ul><li>There were actually
      <strong>TWO French designers</strong> competing to make the tiniest
      swimsuit in 1946.</li><li>Reard’s winning design, two inverted triangles
      connected by string, used <strong>just</strong> <strong>30 ins of
      fabric.</strong></li><li>Reard shocked saying:A 2-piece wasn’t a bikini
      <strong>“unless it could be pulled through a wedding
      ring.”</strong></li><li><strong>Fun fact:</strong> If the other design won
      out, we’d call a bikini an “atom.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>The bikini didn't really catch on in America until the '60s, but
      by the '70s, it went from scandalous to ubiquitous. Last month, the Miss
      America contest said it will end its swimsuit competition which has been
      included since the 1st pageant in 1921.</p><p><a
