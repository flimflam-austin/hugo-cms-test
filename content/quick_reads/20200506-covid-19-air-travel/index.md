      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><p>Sustained economic loss due to a drop in
      travel. It’s not just about the airlines, but everything related: hotels,
      restaurants, tourist sites, shopping, and beyond.</p><p>One industry group
      says the economic impact of COVID-19 (in dollars) on the travel industry
      overall will be <strong>9 times worse than the aftermath of September
      11th.</strong></p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“There’s no magic formula.”</blockquote><p>Harvard global
      health professor Ashish Jha on when people will feel comfortable traveling
      again. Delta's CEO recently commented about the idea of using "immunity
      passports" - a document or card showing a passenger had exposure to the
      virus and therefore has some immunity (although that's yet to be
      scientifically proven). A form of these "passports" have been used in
      China and Chile. However, questions remain about the reliability of
      COVID-19 antibody testing.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Too hard to tell at this point… I hope down the road it
      is, but our priority is opening up the domestic economy. Obviously, for
      business people that do need to travel, there will be travel on a limited
      basis. But this is a great time for people to explore
      America.”<br><br>Treasury Sec. Steven Mnuchin when asked whether
      international travel will open up this year for Americans. Airlines have
      started cutting international flights.</blockquote><p><br></p></div>

      Squeezing in like sardines might be a thing of the past *for now* as
      airlines look to create more space between passengers.</p><p><strong>More
      Screening</strong>: A Seattle airport is utilizing thermal imaging cameras
      to detect fevers among potential passengers. There’s some discussion about
      health screening at security checkpoints, but the TSA says it’s
      TBD.</p></div>
