      ## BIG PICTURE


      **Numbers:** As of May 4, the number of U.S. passengers**dropped 93% vs.
      last year.**


      **Perspective:** Last April, on average, 2M+ traveled by plane every day
      in America. This April: just under 110,000 per day.


      **Developments:** At least 5 major U.S. airlines require passengers to
      wear face masks.

      ## Why It Matters


      Sustained economic loss due to a drop in travel. It’s not just about the
      airlines, but everything related: hotels, restaurants, tourist sites,
      shopping, and beyond.


      One industry group says the economic impact of COVID-19 (in dollars) on
      the travel industry overall will be**9 times worse than the aftermath of
      September 11th.**

      Harvard global health professor Ashish Jha on when people will feel
      comfortable traveling again. Delta's CEO recently commented about the idea
      of using "immunity passports" - a document or card showing a passenger had
      exposure to the virus and therefore has some immunity (although that's yet
      to be scientifically proven). A form of these "passports" have been used
      in China and Chile. However, questions remain about the reliability of
      COVID-19 antibody testing.

      > “Too hard to tell at this point… I hope down the road it is, but our
      priority is opening up the domestic economy. Obviously, for business
      people that do need to travel, there will be travel on a limited basis.
      But this is a great time for people to explore America.”  
        
      Treasury Sec. Steven Mnuchin when asked whether international travel will
      open up this year for Americans. Airlines have started cutting
      international flights.

      ## INNOVATIONS?


      **The Dreaded Middle Seat**: Squeezing in like sardines might be a thing
      of the past *for now* as airlines look to create more space between
      passengers.


      **More Screening**: A Seattle airport is utilizing thermal imaging cameras
      to detect fevers among potential passengers. There’s some discussion about
      health screening at security checkpoints, but the TSA says it’s TBD.

      The U.S. has issued a level 3 travel notice, warning of widespread ongoing
      COVID-19 transmission, and potential refusal of entry or quarantine upon
      return to the United States for EVERY country on the planet. See the map
