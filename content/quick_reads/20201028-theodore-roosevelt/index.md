      At 43, Roosevelt became the youngest president to serve, after the
      assassination of Pres. McKinley. Grief led him to explore and love the
      wild American west as a young man and conservationism became a part of his
      legacy. He preserved hundreds of millions of acres of public lands, such
      as the Grand Canyon.
