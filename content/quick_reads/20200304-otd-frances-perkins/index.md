      to give all the people under its jurisdiction the best possible life.”


      > Frances Perkins began her work in public service as a social worker. Her
      pursuit for workers' rights was shaped during a trip to NYC on the day of
      the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, when nearly 150 workers died.
      She held many positions in the New York government under then-Governor
      Franklin D. Roosevelt and his predecessor.

      In 2008, the Frances Perkins Center was established in Maine to honor
      Perkins' legacy and continue her work. The nonprofit and nonpartisan
      center recently purchased Perkins' ancestral homestead, which was
      designated a National Historic Landmark.
