      ## What’s At Stake?


      * Supreme Court Justice**serves for lifetime.**

      * Pres nominates Judge;**Senate must confirm.**

      * Court functions even if all 9 seats aren’t filled; currently 4 “left
      leaning” & 4 “conservative” justices.

      * Kavanaugh described as a “conservative” judge, which would tip the court
      to the “right.”

      remove my clothing."  
        
        
      Professor Christine Blasey Ford describing what she says happened 30+
      years ago at a high school party when Kavanaugh and his friend allegedly
      trapped her in a room. She doesn't remember exact date or place - says
      everyone was drinking. She claims Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge jumped on
      top of them, causing them all to fall, and she freed herself.

      ## Timing Matters


      * Senate Judiciary Cmte was scheduled to vote THIS Thursday for/against
      Judge Kavanaugh.**This isn’t happening.**

      * **RepublicansA** want Kavanaugh confirmed before midterms (Nov) & next
      SCOTUS term (Oct).

      * **DemocratsA** want to delay vote; if Senate flips to Dem majority after
      midterms they can block Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

      ## Some Things To Consider:


      * Allegations never surfaced during ANY of Kavanaugh’s prior character
      checks (applying to law school, bar, or federal judge).

      * The accuser has NOT filed a criminal complaint, but her lawyers says she
      will share her story with the Senate.

      * No other accusers have come forward at this time.
