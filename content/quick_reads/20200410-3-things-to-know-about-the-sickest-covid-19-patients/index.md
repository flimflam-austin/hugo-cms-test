      **90% of adults hospitalized had one or more pre-existing condition**


      The CDC looked at hospitalizations across 14 states in March. The most
      common preexisting conditions among the sickest COVID-19 patients were
      hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, chronic lung disease,
      diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. On Wednesday, the White House
      COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Debroah Birx noted that asthma is also a
      pre-existing condition.

      **African Americans may be disproportionately affected**


      African Americans accounted for 33% of those hospitalized with COVID-19,
      but just 18% of the population in the 14 states examined by the CDC.
      Caucasians made up 45% of those hospitalized and accounted for 59% of the
      population in the 14 states examined by the CDC.

      **More than half of adults hospitalized are male**


      The overall COVI9-19 hospitalization rate for Americans in the 14 states
      examined by the CDC was 4.6 per 100,000 people. The rate was 5.1 for males
      compared to 4.1 for females. Hospitalization rates increased with age,
      with the highest rates among those 65 and older.

      > “… the potential impact of both sex and race on COVID-19-associated
      hospitalization rates, need to be confirmed with additional data. “


      The CDC says the latest data emphasizes "the importance of preventive
      measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face
      coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are
      difficult to maintain) to protect older adults and persons with underlying
      medical conditions, as well as the general public."

      Why It Matters: We’re getting a more complete picture of serious cases in
      America, but we still need more data to understand why certain people are
      more like to be affected than others.
