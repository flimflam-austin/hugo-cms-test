      condition</strong></p><p>The CDC looked at hospitalizations across 14

      COVID-19 patients were hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity,
      chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. On Wednesday,
      the White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Debroah Birx noted that asthma is
      also a pre-existing condition.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“… the potential impact of both sex and race on
      COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates, need to be confirmed with
      additional data. “</blockquote><p>The CDC says the latest data emphasizes
      "the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing,
      respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where
      social distancing measures are difficult to maintain) to protect older
      adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the
      general public."</p></div>
