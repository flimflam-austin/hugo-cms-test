      key votes in 2 controversial decisions this week, upholding Trump’s

      <div><h2>Next Steps</h2><ul><li>Pres. Trump will name a nominee within
      weeks, setting in motion a process that could allow Senate confirmation by
      the time the court reconvenes in October.</li><li>Only a simple majority
      is required for confirmation. GOP leaders changed the rules when Gorsuch
      was being considered in order to get rid of the 60-vote procedural
      filibuster threshold.</li></ul></div>
