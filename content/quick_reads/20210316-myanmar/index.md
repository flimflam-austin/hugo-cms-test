      <div><h2>Background: The Basics</h2><ul><li>Myanmar is also known as
      Burma.</li><li>After gaining independence from Britain in 1948, military
      rule has continued in varying degrees.</li><li>Site of the <strong>world’s
      longest civil war</strong> as military has battled ethnic
      minorities.</li><li>A move toward democracy with open elections was
      fleeting. After the pro-democracy party won overwhelmingly in the 2020
      election, the military seized power, claiming election

      <div><blockquote>“The world is upside down in Myanmar. We must fight until
      we win. The regime must step down. There is no place for any dictator here
      in Myanmar.”</blockquote><p>U Tin Tun, 46, to The New York Times. Locals
      have taken to the streets in nearly-constant protests since the Feb. 1
      military coup. The military has met the opposition with violence; the
      United Nations estimates 149 protesters have been killed since the coup
      began. 50+ were killed this weekend – reportedly the deadliest exchange to
      date.</p></div>

      health and safety, as well as the health and safety of all detained
      leaders and civil society actors …”</blockquote><p>U.S. State Dept.
      spokesman Ned Price on Aung San Suu Kyi, the former civilian head of govt.
      Kyi was previously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work advocating
      for democracy in Myanmar. Two members of Kyi's National League for
      Democracy recently died in military custody; her condition and whereabouts

      <div><h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Myanmar’s move toward democracy (even
      with a military role in govt.) was seen as a move toward the West and a
      free, open society – a <em>“strategic victory for Washington in China’s
      backyard.”</em> (The Wall Street Journal)</p><p>The military’s violent
      crackdown is getting worse – leading to more death and violence, *and*
      further alignment with China.</p></div>

      <p><br><br>The U.S. has issued sanctions on the regime, as well as an
      emergency order allowing Myanmar citizens to stay in the U.S. for up to 18
      months instead of returning home to the violence. Critics say without a
      concerted effort by the international community, the sanctions will not
      pressure change.</p>
