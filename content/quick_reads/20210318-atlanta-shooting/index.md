      The Details:


      **Who:** 8 people shot and killed (7 women, 1 man). At least 6 of the
      victims were Asian women. 21-year-old Robert Long, a white man, has been
      arrested and is in custody.


      **What:** 3 local massage parlors and spas.


      **Where:** Atlanta area, Georgia.


      **When:** Tuesday evening.

      > “They’re very distraught, and they were very helpful in this
      apprehension.”


      Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds says Long's parents recognized his
      photo and aided in his arrest. Investigators report Long says he has a
      "sex addiction" and was targeting sites of temptation. A mass killing is
      defined as one resulting in the death of four or more people (not
      including the perpetrator), according to a database complied by The
      Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University tracking these
      crimes.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Initial reports: Crime was racially motivated.

      * 24 hours after the attack investigators say it’s too early to confirm
      motive.

      * Broader context: The shooting comes amid**reports of a wave of violent
      and verbal attacks against Asian Americans during the pandemic.** A new
      report details nearly 3,800 “hate incidents” in the last year against
      Asian Americans, the majority targeting women.

      > “We’re not yet clear about the motive. But I do want to say to our Asian
      American community that we stand with you and understand how this has
      frightened and shocked and outraged all people.”


      Vice Pres. Kamala Harris, the nation's first VP of South Asian descent,
      joined Pres. Biden in condemning the shooting. Prior to Tuesday's
      shooting, Congress scheduled a hearing for tomorrow on the rise of
      discrimination and violence against Asian Americans.

      ## What To Know:


      * Under federal law, a hate crime is one motivated in whole or in part by
      a bias against a disability, ethnicity, religion, race, sexual
      orientation, gender, or gender identity. The FBI’s 2020 hate crime report
      is not yet available.

      * Most states, including Georgia, have hate crime laws which add a penalty
      enhancement for crimes motivated by hate (what *qualifies* under that
      varies state to state).

      THIS IS A QUICKLY DEVELOPING STORY. Investigators say Long, who was
      charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault,
      planned to continue his crime spree in neighboring Florida to target “some
      type of porn industry.” The FBI is working alongside local law enforcement
      in the investigation.
