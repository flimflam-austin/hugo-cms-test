      <div><p>“The number of test positives is increasing. That is a
      dramatically important signature that everybody is doing their
      job.”</p><p>Dr. Deborah Birx, White House COVID-19 coordinator, explaining
      that the dramatic jump in positive test results is a good sign because it
      shows our increased ability to test more people. Dr. Birx noted 50% of the
      total U.S. cases are in three states and 10 counties.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The supply has greatly
      expanded.”</blockquote><blockquote>Vice President Mike Pence on the
      increased production of supplies, specifically masks. When asked about the
      discrepancy between reports of limited availability and the White House’s
      assurance of supply, Pres. Trump said "I cannot explain the gap" but that
      he's working closely with local governments to provide them with what they
      need.</blockquote></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Yes, there are drugs in the
      pipeline.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr. Stephen Hahn, FDA Commissioner,
      said the gov't is looking at drugs approved for other diseases to treat
      COVID-19 - including a clinical trial of chloroquine, a drug already
      approved for the treatment of malaria and an arthritis condition. Dr. Hahn
      said a vaccine will take at least a year, but that efforts are moving at
      record speed. He also stated, "I have great hope for how we're going to
      come out of this situation."</blockquote></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We’ll see what happens.”</blockquote><blockquote>Pres.
      Trump on whether more economic stimulus will be needed. On Wednesday, he
      signed a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package into law which includes
      increased unemployment and nutrition assistance, free testing for
      COVID-19, and temporary paid leave for many of those sick or quarantined.
      Last week, the number of people filing for unemployment hit its highest
      level in the two years since Hurricane Harvey.</blockquote></div>

      rest of the Americans, they can spread the virus in a very strong way
      because you know the level of contagion." Dr. Deborah
      Birx</p><p></p></div>
