      ## What To Know:


      * **The New Research**: Survey facilitated by the National Opinion
      Research Center (NORC) at the**University of Chicago** & focused on how
      Americans feel during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      * The analysis pulls from previous research, asking similar questions,
      collected over the past five decades.

      * Nearly 2,300 American adults, representing every state & D.C., answered
      questions, mostly online.

      ## Historical Context


      > The COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t necessarily made us more sad (historically
      speaking) but perhaps more hot under the collar.  
        
      _“…fewer Americans report crying or feeling dazed than after either the
      Kennedy assassination in 1963 or the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, but
      more report having lost their temper or feeling bored during the
      pandemic.”_

      ## Money Doesn’t Buy You Happiness (Or Optimism)


      > _“More Americans than in previous decades are unhappy and pessimistic
      about the future, and at the same time, more are relatively satisfied
      financially_.”

      ## THE FUTURE


      In 2018, nearly 6 out of 10 Americans believed their children would exceed
      their current standard of living.


      Today, about 4 in 10 Americans feel their children will exceed their
      current standard of living.


      That’s the lowest percentage since the question was first added to the
      survey in 1994.

      This survey concluded days before the death of George Floyd in police
      custody. Consequently, the answers do not include any reflection of the
      last several weeks of civil unrest in America. How do you think that
      impacts the results?
