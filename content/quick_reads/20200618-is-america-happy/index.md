      <div><h2>Historical Context</h2><blockquote>The COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t
      necessarily made us more sad (historically speaking) but perhaps more hot
      under the collar.<br><br><em>“…fewer Americans report crying or feeling
      dazed than after either the Kennedy assassination in 1963 or the 9/11
      terrorist attacks in 2001, but more report having lost their temper or
      feeling bored during the pandemic.”</em></blockquote></div>

      police custody. Consequently, the answers do not include any reflection of
      the last several weeks of civil unrest in America. How do you think that
      impacts the results?</p><p></p></div>
