      <div><blockquote>“Our report of the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in
      the United States illustrates several aspects of this emerging outbreak
      that are not yet fully understood, including transmission dynamics and the
      full spectrum of clinical illness.”</blockquote><p>Analysis by Washington
      State 2019-nCoV Case Investigation Team who said one of the challenges of
      COVID-19 is that it presents like other respiratory illnesses during flu
      season. They noted the similar, rapid evolution from no signs of pneumonia
      to a diagnosis in 5 days.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Everyone should know these red-flag symptoms. COVID can
      turn serious in any age adult. If you’re a healthy adult under 60, the
      signs and symptoms to seek care are much the same that I would say for the
      flu – prolonged high fever (104 or higher), chest pain, shortness of
      breath, lethargy, or inability to drink fluids or
      urinate.”</blockquote><p>Dr. Darria Long Gillespie, ER physician and

      mitigate this substantially.”</blockquote><p>Trevor Bedford, Bedford Labs,
      wrote this on March 2, 2020. The prominent researcher believes Patient
      Zero may have led to upwards of 1,500 cases in the Seattle area, which he
      expects will mimic Wuhan, China with a spike in illnesses. The CDC calls
      his work tracing the illness an "interesting hypothesis," but says others
      may have contributed to the spread.</p></div>

      <div><p>It reportedly took Patient Zero nearly a month to be deemed "fully
      recovered" and no one in close contact with him is known to have tested
      positive for the illness. The Seattle area remains one of the hardest hit
      in the nation.</p><p></p></div>
