      The Queen during a special address on COVID-19, only her fourth address as
      Queen during a time of crisis. She addressed the nation similarly after
      the passing of her mother in 2002, after the death of Princess Diana in
      1997, and during the first Gulf War in 1991. Her broadcast came hours
      before the UK Prime Minister was moved to intensive care as he battles
      COVID-19.
