      ## Securing the Border


      > Goal is to stop the **25K people,**A **34K lbs of marijuana** & **140
      lbs of cocaine** that came thru El Paso sector (a 260-mile stretch) last
      year.  
        
        
        
      **_‘It’s going to be harder to get over, harder to get through, harder to
      get underneath. It’s going to have a five-foot, anti-scaling plate at the
      top.’_**

      ## IS IT A FENCE OR A WALL?


      > Controversy over if this in fact the “big, beautiful” border wall Pres.
      Trump promised — or not.  
        
        
        
      Currently, 1/3 of the border has a barrier that **up until Monday was
      called a “fence”** by Border Patrol.  
        
        
        
      This new 20-mile stretch is being **called a “wall”** **by Border
      Patrol**A despite it being **the exact same structure used previously**.
