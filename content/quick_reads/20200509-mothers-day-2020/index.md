      May**as a public expression of our love & reverence for mothers of our
      country.”**  
        
      Pres. Woodrow Wilson declared "Mother's Day" a holiday in 1914, but the
      campaign for it started years earlier.

      ## The Daughter Behind Mother’s Day


      Anna Jarvis wanted to honor her own mother, who founded “Mother’s Day Work
      Clubs” during the 1860s to provide aid and improve health & sanitation
      practices for mothers in the Appalachian mountains.


      The Clubs also cared for both Union & Confederate soldiers, and encouraged
      reconciliation after the Civil War ended.

      ## Mother’s Day Campaign


      * 1908: Jarvis organized the 1st Mother’s Day in West Virginia to honor
      her mom.

      * 1910: West Virginia made it a holiday, and soon other states followed.

      * 1914: Congress made Mother’s Day the 2nd Sunday in May (the anniversary
      of Jarvis’ mom’s death).

      * By the 1920s, mothers nationwide were showered with candy, flowers,
      cards, & other gifts to celebrate Mother’s Day.

      Jarvis, who intended Mother's Day to honor the role mothers play in the
      family, church, and community, spent the rest of her life fighting against
      its commercialization. This year Americans will spend on average $205 on
      Mother’s Day gifts and celebrations.
