      <div><h2>BLOCKED!</h2><p>As high-profile social media suspensions hit the
      headlines, we ask: What counts as “censorship” on our online
      platforms?</p></div>

      <div><h2>Communications Decency Act of 1996, Section 230</h2><ul><li>The
      federal law protects – in <strong>*most*</strong> circumstances – online
      platforms (<strong>*regardless*</strong> of their size) from legal
      liability for user-posted content <strong>*and*</strong> allows them to
      regulate that content.</li><li>It predates the social media sites that are
      now a part of our everyday lives.</li><li>There’s bipartisan support for
      reviewing and/or updating it, but little agreement on how to do
      that.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>BACKGROUND</h2><ul><li>The law was passed when the internet (as
      we know it today) was in its infancy.</li><li>It was authored by a
      Republican and a Democrat in response to courts issuing opposite rulings
      in defamation suits against online companies.</li><li>The goal was to fuel
      the “technological revolution” with limited gov’t intrusion and protect
      private online companies that “screen indecency and offensive material for
      their customers.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>THE SHIELD</h2><ul><li>Under Sec. 230, online platforms that
      allow users to post content aren’t considered “publishers” of that content
      when it comes to *civil* liability.</li><li>“Publishers” (like print and
      TV media companies) don’t get those protections.</li><li>EX: If a user
      posts something defamatory about you on Facebook, you can sue the user,
      but not Facebook. If they say the same defamatory words on CNN, you could
      also sue CNN.</li></ul></div>

    body: "<div><h2>THE SWORD</h2><ul><li>Under 230, online platforms moderate user content mostly as they see fit.</li><li>It allows them to take “<strong><em>good faith</em></strong>” actions to restrict access to content they deem obscene, excessively violent, or “<em>otherwise objectionable,</em>\_<strong><em>whether or not such material is constitutionally protected</em>.</strong>“</li><li>REMEMBER: The First Amendment protects us from censorship by the government – not private companies.</li></ul></div>"

      <div><h2>What It Looks Like</h2><ul><li>Online platforms set their own
      rules to which users agree when they sign up.</li><li>What a platform
      deems harmful often extends beyond racist language or offensive images,
      and may also include prohibitions against posting false or misleading
      information.</li><li>Ex: Twitter suspends a user who it says posts
      misleading info about COVID-19. The user has no legal basis to sue b/c
      they agreed to abide by Twitter’s rules.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>Former Pres. Trump called on Congress to repeal Section 230 and
      even signed an executive order aimed at minimizing its reach. Speaking
      last year, President Biden also called for Section 230 protections to be
      revoked for social media sites, such as Facebook, but he's yet to present
      any formal plan since taking office last week.</p><p></p></div>
