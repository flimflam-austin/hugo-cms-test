      ## BLOCKED!


      As high-profile social media suspensions hit the headlines, we ask: What
      counts as “censorship” on our online platforms?

      ## Communications Decency Act of 1996, Section 230


      * The federal law protects – in ***most*** circumstances – online
      platforms (***regardless*** of their size) from legal liability for
      user-posted content ***and*** allows them to regulate that content.

      * It predates the social media sites that are now a part of our everyday
      lives.

      * There’s bipartisan support for reviewing and/or updating it, but little
      agreement on how to do that.

      ## BACKGROUND


      * The law was passed when the internet (as we know it today) was in its
      infancy.

      * It was authored by a Republican and a Democrat in response to courts
      issuing opposite rulings in defamation suits against online companies.

      * The goal was to fuel the “technological revolution” with limited gov’t
      intrusion and protect private online companies that “screen indecency and
      offensive material for their customers.”

      ## THE SHIELD


      * Under Sec. 230, online platforms that allow users to post content aren’t
      considered “publishers” of that content when it comes to *civil*
      liability.

      * “Publishers” (like print and TV media companies) don’t get those
      protections.

      * EX: If a user posts something defamatory about you on Facebook, you can
      sue the user, but not Facebook. If they say the same defamatory words on
      CNN, you could also sue CNN.

    body: "## THE SWORD\n\n* Under 230, online platforms moderate user content mostly as they see fit.\n* It allows them to take “**_good faith_**” actions to restrict access to content they deem obscene, excessively violent, or “_otherwise objectionable,_\_**_whether or not such material is constitutionally protected_.**“\n* REMEMBER: The First Amendment protects us from censorship by the government – not private companies."

      ## What It Looks Like


      * Online platforms set their own rules to which users agree when they sign
      up.

      * What a platform deems harmful often extends beyond racist language or
      offensive images, and may also include prohibitions against posting false
      or misleading information.

      * Ex: Twitter suspends a user who it says posts misleading info about
      COVID-19. The user has no legal basis to sue b/c they agreed to abide by
      Twitter’s rules.

      Former Pres. Trump called on Congress to repeal Section 230 and even
      signed an executive order aimed at minimizing its reach. Speaking last
      year, President Biden also called for Section 230 protections to be
      revoked for social media sites, such as Facebook, but he's yet to present
      any formal plan since taking office last week.
