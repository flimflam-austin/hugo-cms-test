      ## BACKGROUND


      * After the Civil War, Congress passed three constitutional amendments:

      * **1865:** 13th Amendment outlawed slavery.

      * **1866:** Congress passed the 14th Amendment, inspired by the question
      of whether freed slaves were American citizens. States ratified in 1868.

      * **1870:** 15th Amendment gave Black men the right to vote.

      ## Equal Protection Clause: Big Supreme Court Cases


      * 1896: The court allowed segregation, ruling separate facilities for
      Black people can be “_equal._“

      * 1954: The court **overruled that decision**, finding that “_separate
      educational facilities are inherently unequal_” & ending segregation in
      public schools.

      * 1967 & 2015: The court prohibited states from passing laws outlawing
      **interracial** & **same-sex marriages.**

    body: "## The Due Process Clause:  \nBig Supreme Court Cases\n\n* Major legal cases related to the 14th Amendment aren’t limited to race.\n* 1936: The court ruled **confessions**\_**obtained by torture** are not voluntary and, therefore, inadmissible at trial.\n* 1973: The court ruled states cannot deny a woman her **fundamental “right to privacy”** to obtain an abortion without certain procedural safeguards."

      Former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson said the 14th Amendment provides
      "the courts with the opportunity to override the will of the people when
      the will of the people discriminates against a segment of our society."
      The 14th amendment is the longest & potentially "most complex" in the U.S.
