      ## Why did it take so long?


      > In 1919, 41 years after it was first introduced, Congress passed the
      19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote.  
        
        
        
      1 year, 2 months & 2 weeks later, the necessary three-fourths of the
      states ratified the 19th Amendment.  
        
        
        
      On Aug 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state to ratify.

      Did you know that during the last census the United States was almost
      50/50 women:men? So when there are more women than men voting...there are
      really MORE women than men voting!
