      ## HURRICANES 101


      * “Hurricanes” (also called “**tropical cyclones**“) are storms with winds
      74 mph or higher. Storms with winds below 74 mph are “**tropical
      storms**.”

      * As a hurricane gets closer to shallow waters and land, winds surrounding
      the center of it blows water to the surface.

      * Although a hurricane’s strength (category) is measured by its wind
      speed, it’s rising water levels that lead to dangerous**storm surges** &
      flooding.

      ## BACKGROUND


      * Scientists began giving hurricanes names (vs. scientific terms or
      numbers) to make it easier for people to**recall, pronounce,**
      and**communicate** with others about it without confusion.

      * Traditionally, hurricanes were named after**saints**.

      * In the 1900s hurricanes were mostly**female-sounding** names – a
      tradition without an origin. The U.S. began using both**male & female**
      names in 1979.

      ## TODAY


      * Hurricanes are named by the World Meteorological Organization.

      * There are six lists of 21 names for Atlantic hurricanes that are reused
      on a**six-year rotation**, i.e., the 2020 list will be used again in 2026.

      * The lists alternate between traditional male & female names starting
      with “A” incl. every letter**except** Q, U, X, Y & Z.

      * **Greek alphabet** (ex: Alpha, Beta) is used if more than 21 hurricanes
      in a year.

      ## DID YOU KNOW?


      * Hurricanes that are particularly destructive and deadly, like Katrina
      (2005), Sandy (2012) and Harvey (2017), have their names permanently
      retired from the lists.

      * Hurricane Laura, like Hurricane Harvey is expected to make landfall as a
      Cat 4.

      * Cat 4 hurricanes (wind speeds between 130-156 mph) involve “catastrophic
      damages” incl. widespread power outages and destruction of homes.
