      <div><h2>HURRICANES 101</h2><ul><li>“Hurricanes” (also called
      “<strong>tropical cyclones</strong>“) are storms with winds 74 mph or
      higher. Storms with winds below 74 mph are “<strong>tropical
      storms</strong>.”</li><li>As a hurricane gets closer to shallow waters and
      land, winds surrounding the center of it blows water to the
      surface.</li><li>Although a hurricane’s strength (category) is measured by
      its wind speed, it’s rising water levels that lead to dangerous
      <strong>storm surges</strong> &amp; flooding.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>BACKGROUND</h2><ul><li>Scientists began giving hurricanes names
      (vs. scientific terms or numbers) to make it easier for people to
      <strong>recall, pronounce,</strong> and <strong>communicate</strong> with
      others about it without confusion.</li><li>Traditionally, hurricanes were
      named after <strong>saints</strong>.</li><li>In the 1900s hurricanes were
      mostly <strong>female-sounding</strong> names – a tradition without an
      origin. The U.S. began using both <strong>male &amp; female</strong> names
      in 1979.</li></ul></div>
