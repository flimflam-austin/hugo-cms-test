      ## DEFENSE RESTS


      > Here are the 3 main arguments made by the defense about why the former
      police officer charged with killing George Floyd should be acquitted.

      > "Undetermined." 


      Fmr. Maryland Chief Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler answering a question
      on how he would categorize George Floyd’s “cause of death.” Fowler says
      Floyd suffered a heart attack due to pre-existing heart disease ~ other
      potential factors include drugs in his system and accidental carbon
      monoxide poisoning. Fowler’s testimony contrasted with the medical
      examiner who determined Floyd’s cause of death to be “homicide” — not drug
      use or heart disease.

      > "I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified, was acting with objective
      reasonableness, following Minneapolis police department policy and current
      standards of law enforcement in his interaction with Mr. Floyd." 


      Fmr. police officer and use of force expert Barry Vance Brodd testified
      that Derek Chauvin acted appropriately - adding that when justified, the
      use of the restraining a suspect face-down is a "control technique," not
      "a use of force."

    body: "> \"I was concerned for the officers' safety, yes.\" \n\nMinneapolis Park Police Officer Peter Chang,\_one of the officers called to the scene on May 25, 2020, testified that he was concerned for the safety of the officers that day because \"the crowd was becoming more loud and aggressive.\" One of the arguments made by the defense is that Derek Chauvin's actions were influenced by the surrounding crowd and bystanders, which he deemed as hostile."

    body: >-
      Derek Chauvin declined to take the stand, invoking his Fifth Amendment
      right not to testify in the case against him. After both sides present
      their closing arguments on Monday, the judge will instruct the jury before
      they head into deliberations.
