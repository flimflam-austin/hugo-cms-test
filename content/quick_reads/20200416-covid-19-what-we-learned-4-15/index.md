      <div><p>“We’re getting there America.”</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence
      emphasized the U.S. is making progress despite the loss of more than
      27,000 American lives due to COVID-19. He noted that although 619,000+
      Americans have tested positive for the virus, more than 45,000 have
      recovered. Those who have recovered may donate their blood, with
      potentially COVID-19 fighting antibodies, in "convalescent plasma
      treatments" for those infected.</p></div>

      <div><p>“This has been very reassuring for us. At the same time we know
      that mortality &amp; the fatalities that we’re facing across the U.S.
      continue.”</p><p>Dr. Birx said we've seen declines in U.S. cases in the
      last few days. She also said there are now 9 states with less than 1,000
      cases (with less than 30 new cases per day), and that states &amp; metro
      areas are being studied individually. Pres. Trump said 29 states are in
      "extremely good shape."</p></div>

      <div><p>“We don’t absolutely know that for sure yet… The other thing we
      don’t know is the durability of protection.”</p><p>Dr. Fauci explaining it
      remains unknown if COVID patients are immune after surviving the illness
      and if they are, how long that immunity lasts. On America reopening, Dr.
      Fauci said there is “not going to be a one-size-fits-all"
      policy.</p></div>

      <div><p>The White House will unveil guidance to governors Thursday on how
      to reopen the U.S. Pres. Trump indicated the federal government will be
      working closely with the governors in their efforts, adding that "if we're
      not happy, we'll take very strong action against a state or a
      governor."</p><p></p></div>
