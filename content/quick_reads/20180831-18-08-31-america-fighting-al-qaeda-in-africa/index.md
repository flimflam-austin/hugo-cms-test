      <div><h2>Why al-Shabaab Matters:</h2><blockquote>"They’ve been able to
      <strong>kill very high numbers</strong> and you didn’t see that five years
      ago. They’ve been able to actually <strong>overrun bases at
      times</strong>. The danger is as African Union forces draw down, they may
      <strong>retake major urban areas</strong>. I think there’s a good chance
      of that."<br><br>Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, Senior Analyst, Foundation for
      Defense of Democracies</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider:</h2><p>While U.S. airstrikes against
      al-Qaeda increased over the last 2 years in Africa (al-Shabaab in Somalia,
      &amp; al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen), they have dropped
      against al-Qaeda in Pakistan, a key area for America’s longest war:
      Afghanistan.</p><p>Why This Matters?</p></div>
