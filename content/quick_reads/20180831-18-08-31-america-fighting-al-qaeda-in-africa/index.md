      ## What You Should Know:


      * U.S. has a consistent bombing campaign vs. al-Shabaab (al-Qaeda’s arm in
      Somalia); **airstrike killed 3 terrorists this week.**

      * U.S. dropped 31 bombs in Somalia in 2017; this year’s # of airstrikes
      likely the**A same or more.**

      * Despite their efforts, military says**A al-Shabaab threatens safety of
      Americans;**A U.S. soldier killed in June.

      ## Why al-Shabaab Matters:


      > "They’ve been able to **kill very high numbers** and you didn’t see that
      five years ago. They’ve been able to actually **overrun bases at times**.
      The danger is as African Union forces draw down, they may **retake major
      urban areas**. I think there’s a good chance of that."

      ## Something To Consider:


      While U.S. airstrikes against al-Qaeda increased over the last 2 years in
      Africa (al-Shabaab in Somalia, & al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in
      Yemen), they have dropped against al-Qaeda in Pakistan, a key area for
      America’s longest war: Afghanistan.


      Why This Matters?

      ## Al-Qaeda (AQ) Adjusts


      * After 17 years at war, our enemies learn lessons.

      * AQ moved deeper into urban areas in Pakistan where drones will not
      strike.

      * AQ returned to Afghanistan. Osama Bin Laden instructed his followers to
      do so.

      * Afghanistan “home” to arguably more terrorist groups now than in 2001:
      AQ, Taliban and ISIS.

      The U.S military reportedly dropped thousands more bombs inside
      Afghanistan in 2017 than in 2016, as U.S. military defends against the
      Taliban & ISIS. Keep An Eye On This Story: China denies reports its
      building a military base in Afghanistan.
