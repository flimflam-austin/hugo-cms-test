      ## Quick Reminder


      * **The House** impeached Pres. Trump on two “charges” (**abuse of power**
      &**obstruction of congress)** related to Pres. Trump requesting Ukraine’s
      help investigating the Biden family.

      * **The Senate** will decide the punishment: whether or not the President
      should be removed from office.

      * Two presidents have been impeached (Andrew Johnson & Bill Clinton), but
      none have been removed from office.

      ## Impeachment Managers


      * The House selected seven managers. Six are former lawyers, and one is a
      former police chief.

      * Managers “prosecute” the case for impeachment (show why the House voted
      in favor of the impeachment articles) to the Senate, who act as the
      “jury.”

      * **COMPARE:** During the impeachment trial of Pres. Clinton, House
      republicans selected 13 impeachment managers.

      ## Witnesses


      * The Senate is expected to vote on whether to allow new witnesses during
      the trial.

      * Democrats want to hear from fmr. national security adviser John Bolton &
      acting WH chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Republicans want the Bidens to
      testify.

      * **COMPARE:** During the Clinton trial, the Senate voted on whether to
      allow witnesses during the trial. 3 witnesses were deposed behind closed
      doors.

      ## BIG PICTURE


      * **The Senate impeachment trial will look like a criminal trial, but it
      isn’t.** For example, there’s no burden of proof, or unanimous verdict
      needed to convict.

      * **Number To Know: 51**. The Senate is made up 47 Democrats (including 2
      Independents) and 53 Republicans.**51 votes** are needed to pass (or
      defeat) any motion.**The Democrats drove the impeachment in the House;
      Republicans take the wheel now.**

      What's next? The House managers will *formally* deliver the articles of
      impeachment to the Senate on Thursday, Chief Justice Roberts will take be
      sworn in to preside over the trial and then administer an oath to the full
      Senate. The "trial" will begin on Tuesday.
