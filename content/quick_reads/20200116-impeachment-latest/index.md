      <div><h2>BIG PICTURE</h2><ul><li><strong>The Senate impeachment trial will
      look like a criminal trial, but it isn’t.</strong> For example, there’s no
      burden of proof, or unanimous verdict needed to
      convict.</li><li><strong>Number To Know: 51</strong>. The Senate is made
      up 47 Democrats (including 2 Independents) and 53 Republicans. <strong>51
      votes</strong> are needed to pass (or defeat) any motion. <strong>The
      Democrats drove the impeachment in the House; Republicans take the wheel
      now.</strong></li></ul></div>
