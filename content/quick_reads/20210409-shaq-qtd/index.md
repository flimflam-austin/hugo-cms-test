      Shaq said he didn't intend for this story to get out, but someone captured
      him on camera picking up the tab for a young man who had put an engagement
      ring on layaway at Zales. Shaq, who has a jewelry line at Zales, talked
      about the power of random acts of kindness. Separately, food for thought:
      the president of Zales recently said the pandemic has boosted jewelry
      sales, specifically of engagement rings!

_Jamie L. Singleton, the president of the Kay, Zales and Peoples jewelry retailers, said that in the third quarter of the year, the three brands saw “double-digit” percentage growth in engagement-ring sales as compared to the same period in 2019. She expects the traditional “engagement season” — between Thanksgiving and Dec. 31, when Singleton said one-half of annual proposals usually take place — will also bring bigger sales than usual. “What we’re learning is that the people that we quarantine with, for the most part, have become the nucleuses of [our] lives,” she said._
