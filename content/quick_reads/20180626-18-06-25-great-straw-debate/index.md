      <div><h2>Why Hate On Straws?</h2><p>“Straws are a luxury, we do not need
      straws to have our drinks, and I think it’s an easy step forward where we
      can have a great impact for our environment.”<br><br>Brooklyn City
      Councilman Rafael Espinal who introduced a straw ban for America's largest
      city in late May, following previous official bans in Seattle, Oakland
      &amp; Miami Beach.</p><p>Flip: What Impact?</p></div>

      <div><h2>Impact? Data Debate</h2><ul><li>You’ll see this number A LOT:
      <strong>Americans use an est. 500,000,000 straws a day</strong> (that
      would mean every single American uses more than 1 straw a
      day).</li><li><strong>That estimate is based on a 9-year-old’s research
      project.</strong></li><li>Whatever the number, debate continues on whether
      straws are public enemy #1 for pollution.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The Last Straw?</h2><ul><li>Straw ban part of renewed focus on
      reducing plastic in the ocean. 60-80% of all marine debris is composed of
      plastic: WCS.</li><li>Study looking at efficacy of general plastic bans
      says <strong>initial results encouraging,</strong> but <strong>more
      research needed</strong>.</li><li>Other study: fishing gear, balloons
      &amp; plastic bags = biggest threat to ocean life, doesn’t name
      straws.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>The patent for the first straw was approved in 1888, but a patent
      for "drinking tubes" for disabled Americans came before that - another
      argument against the straw ban is it will hurt the disabled who depend on
      straws to drink.</p><p><a
