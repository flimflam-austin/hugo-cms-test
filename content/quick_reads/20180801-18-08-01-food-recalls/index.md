      ## Why It Matters


      _"These are the kinds of statistics you should expect in Bangladesh, not
      here.”_  
        
      Jayden Hanson, Center for Food Safety

      ## Things to Know:


      * USDA regulates meat, poultry & eggs; FDA all other foods.

      * Recalls are mostly recommended by gov’t & “voluntary” done by a company
      OR (very seldom) required.

      * **Annual USDA recalls rose 83% from 2012-2017**,A**FDA recalls are up
      93%A** in same period, according to industry consultant, Stericycle. FDA
      disputes this data.

      ## Why All the Recalls?


      **New technology** has regulators & companies able to track down
      contaminants more quickly.


      **Industry consolidation** has different products using the same supply
      chain, so an issue with one supplier can affect multiple products.

      # Important to Note


      It’s not just toxic bacteria that lead to recalls.**Food allergens** made
      up nearly**half (47%) of FDA food recalls & 29% of USDA recalls** in the
      first quarter of this year.


      Congress required food labels to include allergens in 2006, so if an item
      comes in contact with something not listed on packaging, it is recalled.

      You might be surprised to learn how long it takes from the time of
      discovery of a problem to pulling an item off store shelves. An Inspector
      General investigation found it took an average 57 days. A poignant
      investigation takes a closer look - Visit SmartHerNews.com.
