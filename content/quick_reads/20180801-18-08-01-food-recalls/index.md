      regulators &amp; companies able to track down contaminants more
      quickly.</p><p><strong>Industry consolidation</strong> has different

      <div><h1>Important to Note</h1><p>It’s not just toxic bacteria that lead
      to recalls. <strong>Food allergens</strong> made up nearly <strong>half
      (47%) of FDA food recalls &amp; 29% of USDA recalls</strong> in the first
      quarter of this year.</p><p>Congress required food labels to include
      allergens in 2006, so if an item comes in contact with something not
      listed on packaging, it is recalled.</p></div>
