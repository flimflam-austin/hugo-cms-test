      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><p><strong>Federal law prohibits states from
      removing voters from registration solely because of their failure to
      vote.</strong></p><p>The Supreme Court said Ohio’s procedure does NOT
      violate the law because “it removes registrants only when they have failed
      to vote <strong>and have failed to respond to a change-of-residence
      notice</strong>.”</p></div>

      vote</strong>.”</p><p>Ohio’s Republican Sec. of State Jon Husted called it
      ‘<strong>a victory for electoral integrity</strong>.’ Husted is running

      <div><p>Remember: Ohio is a swing state; it can swing republican or
      democrat in state/national elections. That's part of the reason why this
      case has heightened attention, as the voting rolls are HIGHLY important
      for both parties.</p><p><a
