      # Hope Vs. Caution


      > In the same 24 hours, we heard of a “light at the end of the tunnel” and
      a warning of a “dark winter.”

      ## “Positive but Preliminary”


      * Pfizer (U.S. drugmaker) & BioNTech (German drugmaker) partnered to
      develop a**COVID-19 vaccine**.

      * Results from 94 participants of a large, late-stage trial show 90%
      efficacy of protecting against the virus that causes COVID-19.

      * We can’t pick through the data – it’s not published. An independent team
      of experts (outside Pfizer) analyzed results.

      > “It seems to be a proof of principle that we can make a vaccine, that it
      can make an immune response, that it does look safe in individuals that
      have been studied so far and that it actually works in the real world to
      protect against Covid.”


      Dr. Buddy Creech, Dir. of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program. Pfizer
      says it will appeal regulators for approval before the end of November,
      when it has reached the 2-month mark for safety data required by the FDA.

      ## “Another Potential Tool”


      * An antibody treatment by drugmaker Eli Lilly received the FDA’s
      emergency use authorization: “**Bamlanivimab**“

      * Available for use only in specific situations: high-risk patients over
      the age of 12 with a mild to moderate case of COVID-19.

      * Not approved for hospitalized patients – in fact, the FDA says it may do
      more harm than good in severe cases.

      ## Meanwhile…


      * U.S. continues to set daily records for COVID-19 cases, with more than
      100,000 new cases per day; hospitalizations, deaths, & lagging effects of
      infection also have increased.

      * Despite efforts to protect the most vulnerable,**nursing home cases have
      quadrupled between May and October**.

      * New study: About 1 in 10 of hospitalized COVID patients readmitted in
      days following first admission/release.

      > “Trying to protect nursing home residents without controlling community
      spread is a losing battle.”


      Researcher Tamara Konetzka of the University of Chicago says protecting
      the vulnerable ultimately relies on those living and working outside a
      nursing home; when community spread increases, the threat rises to the
      elderly despite increased testing and best efforts.

      What is like to be part of a COVID-19 trial? We have a first hand account!
      A series of other companies have developed a vaccine in a similar way to
      Pfizer with relatively new technology - It's called an MRNA vaccine. No
      MRNA vaccine has been approved...ever. Read more on both on our source
      page.

**What don’t we know yet? ([from WSJ)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-when-will-it-be-ready-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-11604942932)**  
_The effectiveness data announced by Pfizer and BioNTech was positive but preliminary. It left many unknowns beyond whether the vaccine is safe to take. The analysis took place too soon for researchers to figure how long the protection conferred by the vaccine will last; the data only looked how well the vaccine worked seven days after subjects got a second shot. “What will be the protective efficacy over time?” Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s vaccine-research group. “Is this going to be a handful of months, like the flu vaccine? Is it going to be like measles or smallpox where it’s lifelong immunity?” It also is unclear whether the vaccine worked at protecting against severe Covid-19 disease. Nor is it clear whether the vaccine worked in all the different populations that would be in line to get one, including the elderly, children and various racial and ethnic groups. Pfizer and BioNTech are expected to release additional data later._
