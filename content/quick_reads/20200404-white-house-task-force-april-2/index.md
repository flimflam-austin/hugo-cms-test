      “I have family in New York. My sister is a nurse practioner in a
      Westchester hospital. And my niece is a nurse on a Long Island hospital…I

      workers. I’m going to get more to healthcare workers.”

      Treasury Sec. Steven Mnuchin said initial stimulus payments for Americans
      will happen sooner than the 3 weeks expected. He emphasized those with

      to cash in person at the bank). Sec. Mnuchin said a new, soon-to-be
      announced web portal will help citizens update their information.
