      # Sun’s Out, Sunscreen On!


      **Could free sunscreen be as readily available as public drinking water?**


      The nation’s largest city adds free sunscreen dispensers, even though we
      often don’t know how much to use or what SPF even means.


      Here's The Deal

      * **S**un**P**rotection**F**actor

      * SPF 30 coversA**98% of UVB rays**; Higher than SPF 30 offers only
      slightly higher protection.

      * SPF doesn’t reflect protection against**dangerous UVA rays**.

      * Docs worry those wearing higher SPF may feel “invincible” and stay in
      sun longer.

      ## An American dies of melanoma every hour


      > “Many of the more than 5 million skin cancer cases that are diagnosed
      annually could be prevented by protecting skin from excessive sun exposure
      and not using indoor tanning devices.”

      Did you know you should be using ‘about a shot-glass worth of BROAD
      SPECTRUM sunscreen every time you apply? Though the first free sunscreen
      made this tough to do. We learned a lot creating this card - we hope you
      did too!

* **BrightGuard Installs Free Sunscreen Dispensers at New York City Public Pools and Beaches:**

* **Forget the Sunscreen? It’s Free Now in Some Cities_:_**  
_While the idea to supply sunscreen to people during the summer may seem like a no-brainer, it hasn’t been without its bumps. As a city focused on wellness, Boston wanted its dispensers to dole out “all-natural” products, said Girard. That caused a problem: The sunscreen was so thick that it struggled to come out of the dispensers. When it did, it was often entirely too much and ended up being rubbed on statues and benches.A Eventually, they perfected the product — and the dispensers — using a sunscreen with a higher amount of glycerin_.

* **Free Sunscreen:**  
_You can buy a product that is labeled as higher than SPF 30, but it”s almost always a waste, and potentially harmful. SPF 15 filters out aboutA 93 percentA of UV-B rays. SPF 30 filters out approximately 97 percent. SPF 50 filters out approximately 98 percent. SPF 100A mightA get you to 99. The problem, though, is the psychology of the larger number. Above 30, the difference is essentially meaningless, and higher SPFs do not last longer than lower SPFs — but they do tend to make people feel invincible. We put on the “more powerful” sunscreens and then suddenlyA thinkA we’re Batman or some other superhero who can stay out in the sun indefinitely. But no sunscreen is meant to facilitate prolonged exposure of bare skin to direct sunlight._[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/when-it-comes-to-choosing-a-sunscreen-everyone-is-getting-burned-by-their-own-ignorance/396173/?utm_term=2018-07-05T16:17:51&utm_medium=social&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_campaign=atlantic-health&utm_source=twitter](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/when-it-comes-to-choosing-a-sunscreen-everyone-is-getting-burned-by-their-own-ignorance/396173/?utm_term=2018-07-05T16:17:51&utm_medium=social&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_campaign=atlantic-health&utm_source=twitter)
