      <div><h2>How Will Deal Affect
      You?</h2><blockquote></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Less
      Competition:</strong> U.S. wireless market dominated by 3
      players.</li><li><strong>Closer in Size:</strong>A Tie-up gives
      T-Mobile/Sprint 100M customers (AT&amp;T 93M, Verizon
      116M).</li><li><strong>5G:</strong> Faster rollout of a nationwide
      higher-speed internet network.</li><li><strong>Higher Bills?:</strong>
      Unclear, but Economics 101: less competition = higher
      prices.</li></ul><p></p><p>FLIP: opposing takes</p></div>

* How Would a T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Affect Your Cellphone Bill?:

**_Will my bill go up?_**  
_Possibly, but not immediately. It”s difficult to promise that prices will remain at their current levels, even though the companies say consumers should expect the deal to lower prices.**But more competition is generally regarded as better for consumers. After all, look at what happened after regulators denied an attempted merger by T-Mobile and Sprint in 2014.**That year, after regulators signaled they would reject a deal, the two companies began a price war that rippled across the industry. Then in August 2016, T-Mobile was the first carrier in the United States to offer unlimited voice, text and data plans. The next day, Sprint began offering a $100 unlimited voice, text and data plan for two lines. Six months later, Verizon and then AT&T followed with similar offerings. Over all, wireless prices declined 13 percent from March 2016 to March 2017, according to the Labor Department._
