      > “Last year was bad; this year is horrible.”  
        
      Chris Winkler, on having to shut down two of his four Christmas Tree
      selling locations in Kendall, Florida, due to a nationwide Christmas Tree
      shortage, which experts blame on the 2008 financial crisis. Trees take
      about 10 years to grow and the crisis meant growers planted fewer trees to
      save money. Fear not! The shortage doesn't mean you'll have to buy an
      artifical tree, but it could mean higher prices and less selection.

      could be problematic for them.”  
        
      Mike Ramsey, Gartner transportation analyst, on General Motors decision to
      end production of smaller passenger cars like the Chevrolet Cruze, laying
      off 14K+ employees and closing plants in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland &
