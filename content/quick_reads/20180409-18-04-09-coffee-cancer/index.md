      ## Does Coffee Cause Cancer?


      World Health Organization (WHO) studies indicate coffee is unlikely to
      cause certain cancers and lower the risk of others.


      In 2016, the WHO’s cancer unitA moved coffee off the ‘possible carcinogen’
      list, but says evidence is insufficient to rule out any possible role.

      Starbucks and other coffee purveyors says the level of the acrylamide
      (which has been on California's Prop 65 list of chemicals since 1990) in
      coffee isn't harmful and that any risks are outweighed by coffee's
      benefits. Read More:
