      > “John McCain’s life is a story of service above self…. John is an
      independent man who thinks for himself. He’s not afraid to tell you when
      he disagrees. Believe me, I know. No matter what the issue, this man is
      honest and speaks straight from the heart.”

      said, ‘John, I’m at 2nd and Vine in Oshkosh and I need your help. Come,’
      he’d get on a plane and come. And I would for him, too.”
