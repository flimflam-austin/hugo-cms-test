      ## Record-Breaking Queen


      In 2007, at 81, she became the **oldest British monarch**, beating a
      record set by Queen Victoria (her paternal great-great-grandmother).


      In 2015, at 88, she became the **world’s oldest monarch.**_Months later,
      she passed Queen Victoria again, & became **Britain’s longest-reigning
      monarch.**

      ## Bag Lady?


      The Queen is rarely seen without a handbag and it’s usually her signature
      black Launer bag (a British designer), in which she’s been known to carry
      her reading glasses, lipstick, and a handkerchief.


      **One item not in her purse?**  

      A passport; she doesn’t need one! (because they are issued in her name).

      Although she is the world's longest (living) monarch, she is not *yet* the
      longest reigning monarch - that title goes to the former King of
      Swaziland, who spent 82 years on the throne after ascending to the thrown
      at age 1.
