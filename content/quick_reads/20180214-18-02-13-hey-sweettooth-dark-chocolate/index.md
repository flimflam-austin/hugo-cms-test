* **Christy Youens, Registered Dietician, to SmartHer News:**  
_“It is estimated that people consume 11-13 pounds of chocolate annually! But not all chocolate is created equal.A_ _There are a myriad of proposed health benefits of dark chocolate. Cocoa 70% or higher seems to have the most heart health benefits. The flavanols found in high percentage cocoa have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. They are very good for your heart, in moderation, of course! “_
