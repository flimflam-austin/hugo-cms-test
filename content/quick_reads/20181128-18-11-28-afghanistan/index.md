      <div><h2>Something To Consider:</h2><blockquote>The Taliban now control
      more of Afghanistan than any other time during America’s longest war; al
      Qaeda remains a close ally of the Taliban.<br><br><em>“Al Qaeda remains a
      threat. Its operatives are fighting in more countries around the world
      today than was the case on 9/11.”</em><br><br><br><br>Tom Josceyln, The
      Long War Journal</blockquote></div>
