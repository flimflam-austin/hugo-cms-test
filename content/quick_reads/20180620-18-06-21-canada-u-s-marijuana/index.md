      <div><h2>Marijuana: State vs. Feds</h2><p><strong>Marijuana is illegal
      under federal law.</strong> But, as more states began to legalize it
      within their borders, the federal gov’t shifted its focus away from
      prosecuting <strong>*most* marijuana-related crimes</strong> in situations
      where there is compliance with state laws.</p><p>Instead, opting to focus
      on “<strong>serious drug traffickers while taking into account state and
      local laws</strong>.”</p></div>
