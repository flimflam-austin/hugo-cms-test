      ## 1776: America’s Beginnings


      * On July 4, 1776, the American colonies declared independence from Great
      Britain, but the first presidential election wasn’t held until in 1789.

      * In most states, the right to vote was limited initially to land owners
      (mostly white men).

      * For many years voting rights were dictated largely by the Constitution
      and state laws until Congress first began to weigh in via federal
      legislation in 1957.

      ## 1870: Post Civil War


      * The 15th Amendment granted all citizens the right to vote regardless of
      race or prior enslavement.

      * At the time, the term “citizens” was expanded to include African
      American men – NOT Native American men.

      * However, for the next nearly 100 years, states used other ways to limit
      voting, like literacy tests & requiring voters to pay to vote (poll
      taxes).

      ## 1920: Women


      * Nearly 80 years after the women’s voting movement unofficially began in
      1840, the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote in 1920.

      * Due to existing state laws at the time, the right was initially limited
      to mostly white women.

      * The U.S. wasn’t the first. New Zealand became the first country to grant
      all women the right to vote in 1893.

      ## 1924: Native Americans


      * The Indian Citizenship Act granted Native Americans citizenship, and
      thus, the right to vote.

      * However, states were still free to impose limits on the right to vote
      for many years.

      * In 1962, New Mexico became the last state to grant Native Americans
      voting rights.

      ## 1950s and 1960s:  

      Civil Rights Movement


      * The movement led to federal action securing the right to vote for
      African Americans & others by outlawing state-imposed barriers restricting
      voting.

      * In 1964, Congress passed the 24th Amendment, prohibiting poll taxes.

      * In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, banning literacy tests.
      Most African Americans in the South were not registered to vote until this
      time.

      DID YOU KNOW? It wasn't until the passage of the 23rd Amendment in 1961
      that DC residents were allowed to vote in presidential elections. Ten
      years later, during the wake of the Vietnam War in 1971, Congress passed
      the 26th Amendment, lowering the voting age to 18. Traditionally the
      voting age was 21.
