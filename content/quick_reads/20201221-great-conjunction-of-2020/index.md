      <div><h2>A CHRISTMAS STAR</h2><blockquote>For the first time in hundreds
      of years, a unique alignment of two planets – creating a special
      “Christmas Star” for all to see.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>What To Know:</h2><ul><li>Mark your calendar: <strong>Monday,
      Dec. 21st.</strong></li><li>The two largest planets in our solar system
      will appear “exceedingly” close together in the Earth’s night
      sky.</li><li>Jupiter &amp; Saturn – though remaining 450+ million miles
      apart – might even appear as an elongated star.</li><li>Astronomers call
      it the “great conjunction” – <strong>it will be *most* visible for an hour
      after sunset.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“You can imagine the solar system to be a racetrack, with
      each of the planets as a runner in their own lane and the Earth toward the
      center of the stadium. From our vantage point, we’ll be able to be to see
      Jupiter on the inside lane, approaching Saturn all month and finally
      overtaking it on Dec. 21.”</blockquote><p>Astronomer Henry Throop,
      Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><p><strong>2020 is truly historic</strong>:
      it’s been 800 years since a comparable great conjunction occurred at
      night, and the planets haven’t appeared to be THIS close (just a tenth of
      a degree apart) in 400 years.</p><p><strong>No telescope needed</strong>:
      Although occurring every 20 years, this alignment is rarely visible from
      Earth; the next time we’ll be able to witness a similar event will be
      March 2080.</p></div>

      <div><p>Timing is everything! Is this similar to how the biblical "Star of
      Bethlehem" may have looked on Christmas night when Jesus was born?
      Astronomers can't be sure, but believe a similar conjunction occurred
      around 6 or 7 BC. Regardless, whatever your faith, location, or point of
      view - we can all witness this "star" together.</p><p></p></div>
