      The Vermont parent raised over $7,000 for her school district’s janitors
      after they worked for two days to sanitize local schools amid a COVID-19
      scare. She said it was important to recognize the already
      under-appreciated workers who potentially contaminated themselves in order
      to help others. There are more than 2.4 million janitors and building
      cleaners in America.
