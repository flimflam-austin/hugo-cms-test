      ## Big Picture: Afghanistan


      * The Taliban controls more territory in Afghanistan now than at any other
      time in America’s longest war.

      * In February, the U.S. signed a “peace deal” with the Taliban based on
      certain conditions that *could* lead to the withdrawal of American forces.

      * A recent State Dept. assessment says the Taliban and other
      al-Qaeda-linked groups continue violent attacks despite the deal’s terms.

      ## Reports: What To Know

      agency paying “Taliban-linked” militants to kill American soldiers.

      * Reports: U.S. intel identified money flowing from Russian military to

      of bounty.

      > “There was not a consensus among the intelligence community. And, in
      fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community,
      and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified.”


      White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany during an afternoon briefing
      Monday. The White House continues to call the reports "unverified."

      > “I do not understand for a moment why the president is not saying this
      to the American people right now and is relying on ‘I don’t know,’ ‘I
      haven’t heard,’ ‘I haven’t been briefed.’ That is just not excusable.”


      Congressman Adam Schiff (D-Ca) as reports, referencing the anonymous
      officials, cite the President heard of these reports in February.

      recent media reporting, and we will brief the president and congressional
      leaders at the appropriate time. This is the analytic process working the
      way it should. Unfortunately, unauthorized disclosures now jeopardize our
      ability to ever find out the full story with respect to these
      allegations.”

      ## The Politics


      The President’s critics point to the story as highlighting further
      evidence that the President isn’t tough enough on Russia.


      The President’s allies say this story lacks evidence and serves as another
      attempt to hurt the President by tying him to false allegations of Russian
      collusion.

      America entered Afghanistan because the Taliban provided al-Qaeda a safe
      harbor to organize, train, and plot September 11th terror attacks. A
      shooting on a Navy base in Florida last year was recently tied to
      al-Qaeda. Read more on our source page.
