      ## Take Me To Church


      > The Supreme Court rules California must allow indoor worship services
      (while also permitting certain restrictions).  
        
      What happened & why some believe this ruling reflects more than just
      church and state.

      ## The Backstory


      * California = America’s most populous state, and one of the hardest-hit
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      * CA’s restrictions vary by county based on how widespread infection is.
      “Tier 1” counties, with the highest infections, have had the strictest
      rules – incl. no indoor dining or worship services.

      * CA churches argued the restrictions violated their constitutional rights
      & appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

      > “…if Hollywood may host a studio audience or film a singing competition
      while not a single soul may enter California’s churches, synagogues, and
      mosques, something has gone seriously awry.”


      Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch writes CA is "playing favorites ... to
      protect lucrative industries" with the same or less risk than someone
      attending church – i.e. allowing manicurists & retail stores to operate
      indoors w/ limited capacities.

      > “Justices of this court are not scientists. Nor do we know much about
      public health policy. Yet today the court displaces the judgments of
      experts about how to respond to a raging pandemic.”


      Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan argues the court is insisting on
      treating church services like secular activities that pose less risk to
      the community. In a divided ruling, the court says CA must allow indoor
      worship for now but may limit singing & chanting, and may cap overall
      capacity at 25%.

      Almost all CA is in "Tier 1," meaning most Californians haven't been able
      to attend indoor services. The SCOTUS ruling includes new justice Amy
      Coney Barrett - considered "conservative" by analysts. An early case study
      on COVID loosely connected church attendance & singing to infection
      spread; those findings were based on no mask-wearing, social distancing,
      or capacity limits.
