      <div><h2>The Backstory</h2><ul><li>California = America’s most populous
      state, and one of the hardest-hit during the COVID-19
      pandemic.</li><li>CA’s restrictions vary by county based on how widespread
      infection is. “Tier 1” counties, with the highest infections, have had the
      strictest rules – incl. no indoor dining or worship services.</li><li>CA
      churches argued the restrictions violated their constitutional rights
      &amp; appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“…if Hollywood may host a studio audience or film a
      singing competition while not a single soul may enter California’s
      churches, synagogues, and mosques, something has gone seriously
      awry.”</blockquote><p>Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch writes CA is
      "playing favorites ... to protect lucrative industries" with the same or
      less risk than someone attending church – i.e. allowing manicurists &amp;
      retail stores to operate indoors w/ limited capacities.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Justices of this court are not scientists. Nor do we
      know much about public health policy. Yet today the court displaces the
      judgments of experts about how to respond to a raging
      pandemic.”</blockquote><p>Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan argues the
      court is insisting on treating church services like secular activities
      that pose less risk to the community. In a divided ruling, the court says
      CA must allow indoor worship for now but may limit singing &amp; chanting,
      and may cap overall capacity at 25%.</p></div>

      <div><p>Almost all CA is in "Tier 1," meaning most Californians haven't
      been able to attend indoor services. The SCOTUS ruling includes new
      justice Amy Coney Barrett - considered "conservative" by analysts. An
      early case study on COVID loosely connected church attendance &amp;
      singing to infection spread; those findings were based on no mask-wearing,
      social distancing, or capacity limits.</p><p></p></div>
