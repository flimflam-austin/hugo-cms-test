      ## BACKGROUND


      * **Before Election Day:** Each state’s political parties nominate
      *electors* (Electoral College members) who *usually* pledge to vote for
      their party’s candidate (the U.S. Constitution doesn’t require it, but
      most states do).

      * **After Election Day:** The results in each state determine which
      electors (Republicans or Democrats) will cast their ballots about 6 weeks
      after Election Day.

      ## January 6 at 1 p.m. EST


      * Federal law mandates the House & Senate meet in**joint session** to
      count the certified Electoral College votes.

      * The**vice president** (Senate president) presides in a mostly ceremonial
      role.

      * Two House members & two senators act as “**tellers**” who read & count
      the Electoral College votes from each state.

      * Any senator or House member may**object** to counting an electoral vote.

      * The candidate w/ majority vote wins.

      ## The Objection Process


      * An objection must be in writing & signed off by at least one senator &
      one House member.

      * No specific reason required; objections must be stated “_clearly and
      concisely.”_

      * The House & Senate meet separately, up to 2 hours, to debate the
      objection; the lawmakers then vote on it.

      * ***If*** an objection passes by a majority in both the House & Senate,
      the vote is not counted. If not, the objection fails.

      ## The Counting Process


      Under the 12th Amendment:


      * The presidential and vice presidential candidates must *both* receive a
      majority of the 538 Electoral College votes (at least 270) in order to
      win.

      * ***If*** no pres. candidate receives 270 votes, the House alone elects
      the pres.

      * ***If*** no VP candidate receives 270 votes, the Senate alone elects the
      VP.

      ## Historical Context


      We’ve only seen formal objections twice since 1887.


      Recent history: In Jan. 2017, then-Vice Pres. Biden oversaw the joint
      session. It took 41 minutes to count the 2016 Electoral College votes.
      Democrat members of the House tried to object – but failed because they
      could not get a senator to sign off on an objection.

    body: >-
      A growing number of Republican lawmakers plan to object to electoral votes
      in several states. The objections are expected to fail, however, since
      Republicans do not have enough votes in either the House or Senate. How
      long this joint session and electoral count will take is unknown.
