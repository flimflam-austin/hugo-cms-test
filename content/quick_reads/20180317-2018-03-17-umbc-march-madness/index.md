      # The Greatest Upset in College Basketball?


      # 16 seeds were **0-135** all-time against #1 seeds until Friday.


      Translation: In the history of the NCAA Men’s college basketball
      tournament (79 yrs), **no team has ever beat a #1 team in the first

      ## Impressive Performance


      UMBC jumped out early & never trailed Virginia in the 2nd half.


      Stunning not only that they won, but how certain the outcome was for the
      last 15 mins of the game.


      At 11:06ET UMBC’s website crashed.


      @UMBCAthletics gained 13K Twitter followers in last 2 mins of game.
