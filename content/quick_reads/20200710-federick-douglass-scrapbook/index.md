      > “Scholars, researchers, students and the world should have access to
      it.”


      Dr. Walter Evans, a retired surgeon, is a leading private collector of
      African-American art, writing, and artifacts. He owned the collection
      before Yale and says of Douglass: "You can't just say he was an editor or
      just an abolitionist or just a politician because he was just so much more
      than that." Douglass inspired many with his personal story, but also
      became a leading activist before, during & after the Civil War.

      A historian describes Douglass' famous July 5, 1852 speech on American
      independence: “He rips the throats out of his audience, before lifting
      them up at the end. He says ‘It’s not quite too late. Your nation is still
      young, still malleable. It’s still possible to save yourselves.’” -- Read
