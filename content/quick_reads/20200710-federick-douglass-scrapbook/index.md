      <div><blockquote>“Scholars, researchers, students and the world should
      have access to it.”</blockquote><p>Dr. Walter Evans, a retired surgeon, is
      a leading private collector of African-American art, writing, and
      artifacts. He owned the collection before Yale and says of Douglass: "You
      can't just say he was an editor or just an abolitionist or just a
      politician because he was just so much more than that." Douglass inspired
      many with his personal story, but also became a leading activist before,
      during &amp; after the Civil War.</p></div>

      <div><p>A historian describes Douglass' famous July 5, 1852 speech on
      American independence: “He rips the throats out of his audience, before
      lifting them up at the end. He says ‘It’s not quite too late. Your nation
      is still young, still malleable. It’s still possible to save yourselves.’”
