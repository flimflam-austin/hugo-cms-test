_From the beginning of Rossellini”s modeling career in the ”80s, regularly posing in front of the lens for legendary photographers such as Richard Avedon and Helmut Newton and appearing on more than a few internationalA VogueA covers, to serving as a longtime face of LancAme, she has always been a bold-lipped beacon for aging gracefully. You know, happiness is a discipline,A she toldA VogueA earlier this year. Happiness is to look at what we have and feel grateful. Of course, I am like every woman. When I look at myself in the mirror, I do see my neck—it drives me crazy. It”s not that I”m immune to that voice. But I try not to listen and to say, “Hey, but the lipstick still looks pretty good!”_
