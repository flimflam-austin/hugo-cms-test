      <div><blockquote>"George Floyd did not die from a primary cardiac event
      and he did not die from drug overdose."</blockquote><p>Cardiologist Dr.
      Jonathan Rich, who reviewed George Floyd's medical records, autopsy &amp;
      videos of the incident, testified that Floyd’s "absolutely preventable"
      death was caused by low oxygen levels "induced by the prone restraint and
      positional asphyxiation,” and unrelated to drug use or pre-existing
      conditions.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>"Both the knee across Mr. Floyd's neck and the prone
      restraint were unreasonable, excessive and contrary to generally accepted
      police practices." </blockquote><p>Law professor, fmr. police officer,
      &amp; use of force expert Seth Stoughton testified that Derek Chauvin's
      use of force during the 9 min &amp; 29 secs he held Floyd face down with
      his knee on Floyd's neck "had the foreseeable effect and a substantial
      likelihood of resulting in death or great bodily harm."</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Once there was no longer any resistance, and clearly
      when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive ... to continue to apply that
      level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back – that
      in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy, is not part of our
      training ... our ethics or our values”</blockquote><p>Minneapolis Police
      Chief Medaria Arradondo testified that Chauvin's use of force and failure
      to render aid were not in line with the department's policies.</p></div>

    useCheckmark: true
    body: >-
      <p>The prosecution argued the use of force employed by Derek Chauvin
      against George Floyd was excessive, unreasonable, contrary to the law
      &amp; police training / policy, and consequently resulted in Floyd's
      death. The defense will make the case that the opposite is true, and argue
      Floyd's death was caused by underlying health issues and / or drug
      use.</p>
