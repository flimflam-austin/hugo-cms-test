      George Washington submitting the final draft of the Constitution to the
      Continental Congress, Sept. 17, 1787. He highlighted the challenge of
      bringing states together with different "habits, and particular interests"
      but credited "concessions", "mutual deference" and the spirit of
      friendship for the final product.

      THE NEXT AMENDMENT? In 2019 Congress held the first hearing on the Equal
      Rights Amendment in 36 years. The amendment, passed by Congress in 1972
      would have made gender equality a fundamental right, but ultimately, it
      was not added to the Constitution. See our source page for more.
