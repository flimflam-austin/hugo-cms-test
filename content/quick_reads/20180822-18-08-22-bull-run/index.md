      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><ul><li><strong>Stocks’ “bull market”</strong>
      (sustained period when stocks are rising &amp; expected to continue to
      rise) on track to be <strong>longest in
      history</strong>.</li><li>Surprising after <strong>stocks plunged 50%
      during the financial crisis</strong> ending March 9, 2009.</li><li>Gains
      have <strong>added trillions of dollars</strong> to household wealth,
      boosting the economy and retirement savings.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Important Context</h2><ul><li>Last time stocks rose for this long
      was theA <strong>dot-com boom</strong> (October 1990 – March
      2000).</li><li>However, during the 1990s run, stocks rose 417%. That’sA
      <strong>nearly 25% *MORE* than this current bull market</strong>
      <strong>run,</strong>A according to LPL Financial.</li><li>Bottom line:
      <strong>it’s the longest bull market, but not necessarily the
      greatest.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <blockquote>“This bull market has been breathtaking…valuations in general
      have become stretched; however, corporate earnings have been strong, and I
      believe US stocks are likely to continue to outperform in the shorter term
      given the strength of the US economy and the perceived safety of US stocks
      in the midst of trade wars.”<br><br><br>Kristina Hooper, Invesco's chief
      global market strategist, as the S&amp;P 500 rose to a new all-time high
      Tuesday.</blockquote>
