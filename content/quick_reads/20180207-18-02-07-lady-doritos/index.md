1. **Doritos announced that it is not making a “lady-friendly” chip that doesn”t crunch**A [http://www.businessinsider.com/doritos-not-making-lady-doritos-chips-2018-2](http://www.businessinsider.com/doritos-not-making-lady-doritos-chips-2018-2)
2. **Freakonomics Podcast**:A http://freakonomics.com/podcast/indra-nooyi/  
DUBNER: So is there a male and female version of chips that you”re playing with, or no?  
NOOYI: It”s not a male and female as much as are there snacks for women that can be designed and packaged differently? And yes, we are looking at it, and we”re getting ready to launch a bunch of them soon. For women,A low-crunch, the full taste profile, not have so much of the flavor stick on the fingers, and how can you put it in a purse? Because women love to carry a snack in their purse. The whole design capability we built in PepsiCo was to allow design to work with innovation. Not just on packaging colors, but to go through the entire cycle, and say, All the way to the product in the pantry, or how it”s being carried around, or how they eat it in the car, or drink it in the car, what should be the design of the product, the package, the experience, so that we can influence the entire chain?
