      ## THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

      ## How It Works:


      * When you vote this November, you won’t *really* vote for president and
      VP. You’ll vote for a slate of electors.

      * Electoral College members pledge to vote for the candidates that win the
      popular vote in your state.

      * The Electoral College has 538 electors. It takes**270 to win the
      presidency**. If there’s a tie, the House of Representatives decides
      winner.

The**compromise**:\_the Electoral College at the 1787 Constitutional Convention.\n* The**only** constitutional requirement – electors can’t serve in federal gov’t.\n* **Did You Know?** Until 1804, electors only voted for pres. and runner-up got VP."

      ## Electoral College Today


      * Every state receives the # of electors equal to its # of representatives
      (based on population) & senators (two). D.C., which has 0 votes in
      Congress, has 3.

      * State laws govern who can serve and state political parties nominate
      electors.

      * In most states, electors make a**pledge** that they’ll vote for the
      presidential candidate who wins the popular vote in their state.

      ## This Week’s Case


      * Most states, but not all, legally require electors to vote for the
      candidate who wins the popular vote.

      * Some of those states impose penalties, or disqualify those who don’t
      vote as pledged – a.k.a “**faithless electors**.”

      * The Supreme Court heard challenges to two state laws penalizing
      “faithless electors” from Colorado & Washington who voted OPPOSITE the
      popular vote of their state during the 2016 election.

      > “The Constitution’s text and the Nation’s history both support allowing
      a State to enforce an elector’s pledge to support his party’s nominee—and
      the state voters’ choice—for President.”


      Justice Elena Kagan, writing the court's unanimous opinion, which held
      that states may require electors to vote for the candidate they pledged to
      support and penalize those "faithless electors" who don't. The decision
      notes that "faithless electors" have never impacted the outcome of an
      election.

      Alexander Hamilton wrote that the Electoral College was not perfect, but
      "excellent." Many disagreed then & many still do. A Supreme Court ruling
      allowing electors to go "rogue" could have strengthened the argument for
      those who want to abolish the Electoral College for the popular vote
      (which would require a constitutional amendment).
