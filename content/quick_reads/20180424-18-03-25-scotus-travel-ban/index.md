      whether the banA is constitutional</strong>A (as applied to the 6

      <strong>specifically</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Did the President exceed

In a recent article for the American Bar Association, Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean and Distinguished Professor of Law at UCLA, and one of the of country”s leading constitutional law experts, laid out the issues at the center of the case, why they matter, and their broader implications.

_“The underlying issues inA Trump v. HawaiiA are enormously important: Do the federal courts have authority to review presidential decisions barring immigration from specific countries? What is the president”s powers to do this? What, if any, justifications are required? May such presidential orders discriminate based on religion, and if not, how is it determined if there is religious discrimination? And if all of this is not enough to make the case significant, it also may reveal the justices” views on presidential power and immigration that could be relevant to other issues pending in the lower courts, such as President Trump”s repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the challenges to President Trump”s threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and states that do not cooperate with immigration officials.”_
