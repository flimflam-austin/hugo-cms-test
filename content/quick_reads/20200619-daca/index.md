      administration, allows *some* who came to U.S. illegally before age 16 to
      “defer” their illegal status &amp; obtain work permits IF they meet
      certain qualifications (i.e. graduated from high school, no felony

      young people granted work permits &amp; temporary protection from
      deportation. NO pathway to citizenship. Critics say it rewards illegal
      immigration, oversteps executive power.</li><li><strong>2017:</strong>
      Pres. Trump announced repeal of DACA
      program.</li><li><strong>2018:</strong> Federal court halted repeal &amp;
      ordered gov’t to accept DACA renewal applications during legal

      <div><h2>ABOUT THE CASE</h2><ul><li>The Court was <strong>not
      tasked</strong> with deciding whether DACA or the decision to unwind it
      were sound policies.</li><li>The Court examined whether the Trump
      administration followed a procedural rule that it *must* provide a
      reasoned explanation for its decision.</li><li>The Court ruled 5-4 that it
      did not and that the decision to rescind DACA was “arbitrary and
      capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The basic rule here is clear: An agency must defend its
      actions based on the reasons it gave when it acted.”</blockquote><p>Chief
      Justice John Roberts, who authored the Court's decision and cast the
      decisive fifth vote in the case alongside the "liberal" justices. In his
      decision he noted that although Pres. Trump has the power to end DACA, the
      administration didn't follow the proper procedure and failed to consider
      important factors, such as hardships to DACA recipients.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an
      effort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct
      decision.”</blockquote><p>Justice Clarence Thomas in a dissenting opinion.
      Many of those who disagree with the Court's decision have accused it from
      "legislating from the bench."</p></div>

      who announced the decision to end DACA during his first year in office and
      it comes months ahead of the election.</li><li>The DACA program was
      created by executive action meaning Pres. Trump (or any subsequent
      president) may exercise executive action to repeal it.</li><li>The ruling
      may place pressure on the legislative branch to make DACA an act of
      Congress.</li></ul></div>

      DACA recipients have been able to apply for renewals as the case worked

      will be able to apply.</p><p></p></div>
