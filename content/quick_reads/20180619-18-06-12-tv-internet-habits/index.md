[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/03/declining-share-of-americans-would-find-it-very-hard-to-give-up-tv/](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/03/declining-share-of-americans-would-find-it-very-hard-to-give-up-tv/)  
_Today, **just 31% of Americans say it would be very hard to give up their TV**, down 13 percentage points from a 2006 survey by the Center. In total, just over half of U.S. adults (55%) say their TV would be at least somewhat hard to give up.__In contrast, **roughly half (52%) of cellphone owners say it would be very hard to give up their cellphone or smartphone, and a similar share of internet users (50%) say it would be very hard to give up the internet.** Each represents a notable increase compared with 2006. In total, 74% of cellphone owners say it would be at least somewhat hard to give up their mobile device, and 73% of online adults say the same about the internet in general._
