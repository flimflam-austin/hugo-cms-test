However, it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension.\"</blockquote><p>The Board upheld the suspension (for now) but ordered Facebook to review it within six months\_to determine &amp; justify a \"proportionate response\" consistent with the rules applied to other users and its policy recommendations. </p></div>"

      Trump  in violation of its policies due to his posts about the Capitol
      Hill riot &amp; election results. </li><li>The posts were removed and he
      was suspended. The next day, the suspension was extended "indefinitely and
      for at least the next two weeks."</li><li>Jan 21: Facebook's Oversight
      Board accepted a referral from Facebook seeking a review of the indefinite
      suspension.</li></ul></div>

      difficult content decisions.</li><li>"The board operates like a Supreme
      Court for content" (<em>Wall Street Journal</em>) issuing rulings on what
      content Facebook &amp; Instagram should allow or remove "<em>based on
      respect for freedom of expression and human rights.</em>" </li><li>The
      board issues decisions &amp; can make content policy recommendations,

      (could vary from 11 - 40 members) initially chosen by Facebook<em> "for
      the diversity of their expertise and the quality of their judgment</em>."
      </li><li>Experts in a range of fields such as journalism, constitutional
      law, &amp; freedom of expression.</li><li>Members come from across the
      globe, incl. the U.S., Kenya, Taiwan, Pakistan, etc.</li><li>In January
      2021, the board issued its first 5 rulings (overturning 4 of Facebook’s

      <div><h2>The Decision-Making Process:</h2><ul><li>Once the board decides
      to take up a case (via referrals from Facebook or appeals from users),
      that case is assigned to a panel of five of its members; we won't know
      which five.</li><li>The panel examines whether the content at issue
      violates Facebook's Community Standards or human rights standards, and
      considers information from Facebook, the user, public comments and outside
      experts.</li><li>The panel presents its decision to the full board for
      review. <strong>The board's</strong> <strong>final decision is
      binding.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider:</h2><ul><li>Your First Amendment right to
      free speech applies to govt. censorship – NOT social media sites run by
      private companies.</li><li>Social media sites are free to set their own
      rules (to which users agree when they sign up) about what type of content
      is allowed. </li><li>Federal law allows companies to take “good faith”
      actions to restrict access to excessively violent, obscene, or “otherwise
      objectionable" content regardless of whether it's constitutionally
      protected - this may include prohibitions against false or misleading
      posts.</li></ul></div>

      <p>This case is not important simply because of former Pres. Trump, but
      also because of the precedent it sets for other high-profile users, world
      leaders, as well as Facebook's 2.85+ billion users and Instagram's 1+
      billion users.</p>
