      “The people are what matter to government, and a government should aim to
      give all the people under its jurisdiction the best possible life.”


      Frances Perkins began her work in public service as a social worker. Her
      pursuit for workers' rights was shaped during a trip to NYC on the day of
      the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, when nearly 150 workers died.
      She held many positions in the New York government under then-Governor
      Franklin D. Roosevelt and his predecessor.

      “I came to Washington to work for God, FDR, and the millions of forgotten,
      plain common workingmen.”


      Sec. Perkins, who came to the White House to help President Roosevelt
      draft and implement labor and economic policies during the height of the
      Great Depression, became the FIRST female cabinet secretary and the
      LONGEST-serving Labor Secretary in history. As the head of the labor
      department, she also oversaw the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

      ## Perkins’ Lasting Legacy


      Perkins played a key role in several key parts of FDR’s New Deal – many of
      which are still in effect today, including:


      * establishing the **Social Security** program (1935)

      * creating **union** & collective bargaining laws (1935)

      * enacting **child labor** laws (1936)

      * setting up federal **minimum wage** laws & the **40-hour workweek**
      (1938)

      In 2008, the Frances Perkins Center was established in Maine to honor
      Perkins' legacy and continue her work. The nonprofit and nonpartisan
      center recently purchased Perkins' ancestral homestead, which was
      designated a National Historic Landmark.
