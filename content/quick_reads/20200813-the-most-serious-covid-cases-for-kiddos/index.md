      <div><p>Black and Hispanic children were much more likely to be
      hospitalized than white (this disparity is also seen in adult cases of
      COVID). The specific reason why remains unknown and data remains
      incomplete. One important statistic: 42% of ALL children had 1 underlying
      condition, the most prevalent, obesity.</p><p></p></div>
