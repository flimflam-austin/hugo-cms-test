      ## COVID & KIDS


      What we’ve learned about the nation’s most serious cases of COVID-19 in
      children.

      ## Backstory


      * The CDC issued a new report on children hospitalized due to COVID-19 in
      America between March 1 – July 25.

      * The CDC looked specifically at 576 hospitalizations across 14 states
      –***not*** TOTAL COVID-19 hospitalizations in children nationwide.

      * Around the same time, children under 18 represented about 7% of COVID-19
      cases in America and 1% of hospitalizations.

      ## Big Picture


      CDC: Children are “at risk” for severe cases of COVID-19 BUT “most
      reported cases of (COVID-19) in children under 18 appear to be
      asymptomatic or minor.”


      * Children hospitalized = 8 per 100,000

      * Adults: 164.5 per 100,000


      Once hospitalized, children had about the same chance of being admitted to
      the ICU (about 1 in 3) but lower rate of death.

      * **Highest hospitalization rates:** 2 years old and under (majority under
      2 months old); “substantially lower” in those 2 to 17 years old.

      * Greatest number of hospitalizations overall: 12-17 year olds who made up
      nearly 42% of the group.

      * fever/chills

      * poor eating

      * nausea/vomiting.

      Black and Hispanic children were much more likely to be hospitalized than
      white (this disparity is also seen in adult cases of COVID). The specific
      reason why remains unknown and data remains incomplete. One important
      statistic: 42% of ALL children had 1 underlying condition, the most
      prevalent, obesity.
