      Hsieh, the 46-yr-old former CEO of Zappos, died Friday from injuries
      sustained during a house fire. Viewed as a revolutionary business leader,
      Hsieh ('Shay') led Zappos to change the shoe sale industry forever despite
      not regularly owning more than 4 pairs of shoes. Amazon bought Zappos in
      2009 for $1B+.
