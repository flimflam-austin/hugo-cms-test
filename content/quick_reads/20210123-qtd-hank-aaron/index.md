      opportunity to do something great. When that time comes, only two things
      matter: being prepared to seize the moment and having the courage to take
      your best swing._“

      Known as one of the best baseball players ever to play the game, Aaron
      broke records and racial barriers in his 23-year career. Admired for his
      athleticism and advocacy for civil rights, Aaron surpassed Babe Ruth's
      all-time home run record in 1974, and went on to hold the record for more
      than 30 years until 2007. Aaron died peacefully in his sleep on Friday.
