      ## WHY WE LEAP


      What you may not know about why we add an extra day *nearly* every four
      years

      “Adding an extra day every four years keeps our calendar aligned correctly
      with the astronomical seasons, since a year according to the Gregorian
      calendar (365 days) and a year according to Earth’s orbit around the Sun
      (approximately 365.25 days) are not the exact same length of time. Without
      this extra day, our calendar and the seasons would gradually get out of
      sync.”

      ## The Origins


      * In 46 BC, w/the Egyptian calendar of 365 days falling about 1/4 a day
      behind the solar year, Julius Caesar ordered 1 day to be added every 4
      years.

      * Over the next 1,600+ yrs, the calendar no longer matched the equinoxes.

      * In 1582, the**“4 year rule**” was amended. Only years equally divisible
      by 4 are leap years. Centuries (ex: 2000) must *also* be equally divisible
      by 400 to be leap years.

      ## Leap Day Babies


      * The chance of being born Leap Day (2/29) is 1 in 1,461 because 1,461 is
      the number of days in four years: 365+365+365+366.

      * At least two women have given birth on three consecutive Leap Days: a
      Norway mom in the 1900s and a Utah mom in the 2000s.

      * A European family holds the Guinness World Record for the most (three)
      generations born on 2/29.

      LEAPING INTO LOVE? In some European countries, like Ireland, there is a
      tradition of women proposing to men on Leap Day. Some even consider it to
      be good luck, but others, like Ukraine and Greece, view Leap Year weddings
      as bad luck.
