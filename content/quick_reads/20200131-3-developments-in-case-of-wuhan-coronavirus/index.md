      ## “NEW” CORONAVIRUS


      * Respiratory illness emerged in Wuhan, a city in China with a population
      larger than NYC.

      * Initially connected to a large animal & seafood market where workers
      became ill. Some reports suggest snakes as the transmitter to humans, but
      TBD.

      * First public info about the illness in late December. One month later:
      170 deaths & nearly 8,000 cases in China; dozens of new cases in 18
      countries.

      ## DECLARATION


      > “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to
      countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with
      it.”  
        
      World Health Organization director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus on the
      organization declaring a "global emergency" over the Wuhan coronavirus.
      The declaration heightens awareness, resources towards battling the
      illness.

      ## CONTAGION


      > “We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know
      now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low.”  
        
      CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield. The first instance of human-to-human
      spread of the disease in the U.S. came from a Chicago woman, who traveled
      to Wuhan, contracted the respiratory illness, and upon returning home
      spread it to her husband.

      ## TRAVEL


      * U.S. State Dept upgraded its advisory to a “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” to
      China, warning Americans of further travel restrictions & potentially
      fewer flights.

      * CDC, Customs & Border Protection screening travelers arriving from China
      at major airports.

      * State Dept. evacuated all Wuhan-based, non-emergency personnel.

      * Russia closed its border with China; North Korea & Mongolia did the
      same.

      Although this story is rapidly developing, one suggestion from healthcare
      providers that remains consistent as the #1 defense against the disease:
      wash.your.hands.
