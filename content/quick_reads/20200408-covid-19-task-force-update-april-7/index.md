      Dr. Fauci speaking about the higher number of COVID-19 cases among the
      African American population. He added that pre-existing conditions (such
      as asthma, diabetes, and obesity) that often lead to a "bad outcome" with
      COVID-19 disproportionately impact the African American community. Dr.
      Birx later clarified that African Americans are not more susceptible to
      the virus.

      Dr. Deborah Birx on seeing some *early* stabilization in *new* COVID-19
      case numbers in areas of concern (such as Chicago and Detroit) outside of
      New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. She says this reflects hope that
      households are succeeding in their social distancing efforts.

      Dr. Fauci says he feels "humbly" confident about children returning to
      school in the fall. However, he warned America will be different, and that
      we will need to adjust as information becomes available, adding that
      COVID-19 "is not going to disappear."
