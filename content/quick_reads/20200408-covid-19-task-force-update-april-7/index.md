      <div><blockquote>“We’re very concerned… It’s very sad. There’s nothing we
      can do about it right now except to try &amp; give them the best possible
      care.”</blockquote><p>Dr. Fauci speaking about the higher number of
      COVID-19 cases among the African American population. He added that
      pre-existing conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, and obesity) that often
      lead to a "bad outcome" with COVID-19 disproportionately impact the
      African American community. Dr. Birx later clarified that African
      Americans are not more susceptible to the virus.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“It’s really given us great heart.”</blockquote><p>Dr.
      Deborah Birx on seeing some *early* stabilization in *new* COVID-19 case
      numbers in areas of concern (such as Chicago and Detroit) outside of New
      York, New Jersey and Connecticut. She says this reflects hope that
      households are succeeding in their social distancing efforts.</p></div>

      good shape.”</blockquote><p>Dr. Fauci says he feels "humbly" confident
      about children returning to school in the fall. However, he warned America
      will be different, and that we will need to adjust as information becomes
      available, adding that COVID-19 "is not going to disappear."</p></div>
