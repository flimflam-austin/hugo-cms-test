      <div><h2>The Basics</h2><p>Highest unemployment rate in the history of the
      survey dating back to 1948; also <strong>highest month-to-month increase
      ever</strong>.</p><p><strong>20.5M jobs lost.</strong> Job losses seen in
      every category; gains in none.</p><p><strong>Hardest hit: leisure and
      hospitality</strong> with more than 7M+ unemployed – nearly half the
      entire workforce in that category.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><p>In order to be counted as
      “unemployed” in a jobs report, an American has to be able to work, want to
      work and <strong>actively looking for work</strong>.</p><p>An estimated
      9M+ Americans were laid-off but NOT actively looking for work (as their
      lay-off may be viewed as temporary). The government says *If* they were
      counted, the unemployment rate would be closer to 20%.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The sharp increases in these measures reflect the
      effects of the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain
      it.”</blockquote><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces this
      monthly jobs report, notes women have a higher unemployment rate (15.5%)
      than men (13%). The Wall Street Journal suggests this is because large job
      losses occurred in industries where women are "represented in high
      numbers," such as education and health services.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“This has got to be the most heartbreaking day in the
      history of the job market.”</blockquote><p>Austan Goolsbee, former White
      House economic advisor to Pres. Obama, says "we have to hope that this is
      not a normal business cycle" and that it doesn't take many years to repair
      the damage. He says the government (federal and local) should provide more
      support to taxpayers to make sure they aren't evicted or have
      to"liquidate" if the job market doesn't improve soon.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We’re going to rebuild it back as fast as we
      can.”</blockquote><p>Pres. Trump on America's economy. While predicting to
      see a transition back over the next several months he says the stakes are
      high: "We have to come back otherwise you have a broken country." Over the
      last several weeks, lawmakers approved $3T+ of stimulus money during what
      the President referred to as an "artificial" or government-imposed
      shutdown of the economy. Additional stimulus is TBD as lawmakers have
      voiced concern about gov't debt.</p></div>

      <div><p>Early estimates for this month's unemployment rate topped 16%, so
      this report was actually viewed by some as better than expected. For
      context: The national unemployment rate in March was 4.4%. Lingering
      questions: Is this report a one-off? How long does a job recovery
      take?</p><p></p></div>
