      <div><blockquote>“<em>Your work is going to fill a large part of your
      life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is
      great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If
      you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters
      of the heart, you’ll know when you find
      it</em>.”</blockquote><p></p></div>

      <div><p>Jobs, one of the most successful college dropouts ever, co-founded
      Apple in 1976. Nearly thirty years later on January 9, 2007, Apple
      unveiled the iPhone. To date, Apple has sold about 1.5B iPhones. Despite
      previous success, Apple just cut its iPhone sales projections out of
      economic concerns.</p><p><a
