      Public Health Service, on "experimental approaches, that look interesting,
      if not promising" for COVID-19 surveillance, answering a Senate hearing
      question about how children &amp; young adults can safely return to

      evidence of transmission through stools. I know at least one tabloid in
      the UK got a lot of coverage by someone speculating that COVID-19 could be
      spread by flatulence or, to quote the headline, by farting. There really
      is not a lot of science behind that.”<br><br>CDC Deputy Dir. for
      Infectious Diseases, Dr. Jay Butler.</blockquote></div>
