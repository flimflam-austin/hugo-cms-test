      # WHY IT MATTERS:


      * Gov’t funding runs out at midnight on Thursday (2/8).

      * Stops automatic gov’t spending cuts (aka “sequester”).

      * Raises gov’t borrowing limit until March 2019 (after this year’s midterm
      elections).

      * Deal is a rare display of bipartisanship in Congress with each side
      getting a little $omething.
