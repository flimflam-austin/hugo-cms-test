      ## A Special Honor


      > A Capitol police officer will lie in honor in the same site he served to
      protect.  
        
      This unique tradition started with two others who died defending the seat
      of government.

      2021, at the U.S. Capitol and was injured while physically engaging with
      protesters. He returned to his division office and collapsed. He was taken
      to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.”_

      sweet Brian was. He was truly a lovely, humble soul. We are missing him
      terribly.”


      The official statement from the family of Officer Sicknick, who described
      him as "sweet natured through and through." They expressed his devotion to
      his dachshunds and his job, which they said he loved and "was very
      passionate about," never wanting to arrive late or call in sick.

      ## Lie in State Vs. Lie In Honor


      * Both refer to a special honor bestowed by Congress: a memorial service
      where one’s casket sits in the Capitol Rotunda.

      * The honor in America dates back to 1852 when Henry Clay – former Sec. of
      State, congressman & senator – was first to “lie in state” at the Capitol.

      * Average citizens cannot lie in state; that honor is reserved for gov’t &
      military officials.

      * However, eminent private citizens may “lie in honor.”

      ## Lie In Honor


      * To date, only four Americans have received the honor.

      * The first two citizens to receive this special distinction: two Capitol
      police officers killed during an attack by a gunman at the U.S. Capitol in
      1998.

      * Notable: In 2005, civil rights activist Rosa Parks became the first (and
      only) woman to “lie in honor” in the U.S. Capitol. Rev. Billy Graham
      received the honor in 2018.

      Officer Sicknick's service began before he joined the Capitol Police. He
      served in the New Jersey National Guard and deployed twice, once overseas
      after 9/11. Reports suggest Officer Sicknick was hit in the head with a
      fire extinguisher. Approximately 140 officers were injured during the riot
      - details on what we now know our source page.

_The Capitol Police union Chair Gus Papathanasiou: “We have one officer who lost his life as a direct result of the insurrection. Another officer has tragically taken his own life,” Papathanasiou said. “Between USCP and our colleagues at the Metropolitan Police Department, we have almost 140 officers injured.
