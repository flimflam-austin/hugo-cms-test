      <div><p>Officer Sicknick's service began before he joined the Capitol
      Police. He served in the New Jersey National Guard and deployed twice,
      once overseas after 9/11. Reports suggest Officer Sicknick was hit in the
      head with a fire extinguisher. Approximately 140 officers were injured
      during the riot - details on what we now know our source

_The Capitol Police union Chair Gus Papathanasiou: “We have one officer who lost his life as a direct result of the insurrection. Another officer has tragically taken his own life,” Papathanasiou said. “Between USCP and our colleagues at the Metropolitan Police Department, we have almost 140 officers injured. I have officers who were not issued helmets prior to the attack who have sustained brain injuries. One officer has two cracked ribs and two smashed spinal discs. One officer is going to lose his eye, and another was stabbed with a metal fence stake.”_
