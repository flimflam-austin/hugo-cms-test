      ## A “Miami Vice” Connection


      “EGOT” became a thing afterA Philip Michael Thomas (a.k.a. Detective Rico
      Tubbs) pronounced his plan to win all 4 awards within 5 years.


      He even emblazoned a gold medallion with “EGOT” and wore it.


      That was back in 1984. He has not won any of the awards – or been
      nominated.
