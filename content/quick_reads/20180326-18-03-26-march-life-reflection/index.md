      Something To Consider:


      When asked, high school students thought differently than their elders.


      “Those 18 and older said by 54%-33% that tightening gun laws and
      background checks would prevent more mass shootings in the United States.
      Those under 18 were less confident about that; they said by 47%-37% that
      taking those steps would work.”

      How Much Money?  

      TBD: “The Hill” Reports:


      * No specific $$ amount for firearm research.

      will *actually* be devoted to gun-related research despite clarification.
