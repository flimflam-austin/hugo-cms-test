      Volkov, supporter of Putin critic Alexey Navalny, called for Russians to
      shine their cellphone flashlights in courtyards Sunday night to reflect
      support for Navalny; his recent arrest and imprisonment led to the largest
      protests in Russia in recent years - and a violent government crackdown.
