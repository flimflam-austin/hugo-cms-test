      <div><h2>How Many Deaths Has COVID-19 *Really*
      Caused?</h2><blockquote>This question surfaced after data from the CDC
      appeared to show a very small percentage of COVID deaths had been caused
      by COVID-19 alone.<br><br>What To Know &amp; Why It
      Matters</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>What Happened:</h2><p>The CDC regularly updates information on
      COVID-19 deaths in America.</p><p>The CDC: <em>“For 6% of the deaths,
      COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.”</em></p><p>This caused obvious
      confusion, leading some to believe it meant COVID *only* caused 6% of
      counted COVID deaths in America — and that the remaining 94% died WITH
      COVID-19, not because of it.</p><p><br></p></div>

      <div><h2>Important Context:</h2><ul><li>When someone dies, any cause
      and/or pre-existing condition contributing to their death is often
      recorded.</li><li>COVID-19 deaths may include several contributing
      factors. For example, when <strong>COVID-19</strong> leads to
      <strong>pneumonia</strong> &amp; <strong>respiratory failure</strong>, all
      may be listed on a death certificate.</li><li>In a rare number of COVID
      deaths (6%), COVID-19 was listed as the *<strong>only</strong>*
      cause/condition of death.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>More Context</h2><p>The CDC clarified to SmartHER
      News:</p><ul><li>92% of all counted COVID deaths listed COVID-19 as the
      *<strong>primary</strong>* underlying cause.</li><li>In the other 8% of
      cases, COVID was listed but not as the primary cause. Here’s an example: a
      cancer patient dies with COVID-19. Their primary cause of death is cancer,
      but COVID is listed as a contributing factor.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><ul><li>To date, the CDC has not analyzed
      chronic conditions (i.e. hypertension) &amp; acute causes (i.e. pneumonia)
      into separate categories related to COVID-19 deaths; both may be listed
      together on death certificates.</li><li><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: This
      data simply shows that in the majority of COVID-19 deaths, several factors
      led to someone’s passing — and in most cases, COVID-19 was the primary
      driver.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Approximately 80% of COVID-19 deaths in America to date occurred
      in those 65 and older. The CDC has emphasized that it's not age alone but
      pre-existing conditions that might be a better gauge for risk level. Older
      people simply tend to have more pre-existing conditions.</p><p></p></div>
