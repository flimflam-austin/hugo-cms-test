      ## How Many Deaths Has COVID-19 *Really* Caused?


      > This question surfaced after data from the CDC appeared to show a very
      small percentage of COVID deaths had been caused by COVID-19 alone.  
        
      What To Know & Why It Matters

      ## What Happened:


      The CDC regularly updates information on COVID-19 deaths in America.


      The CDC:_“For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.”_


      This caused obvious confusion, leading some to believe it meant COVID
      *only* caused 6% of counted COVID deaths in America — and that the
      remaining 94% died WITH COVID-19, not because of it.

      ## Important Context:


      * When someone dies, any cause and/or pre-existing condition contributing
      to their death is often recorded.

      * COVID-19 deaths may include several contributing factors. For example,
      when**COVID-19** leads to**pneumonia** &**respiratory failure**, all may
      be listed on a death certificate.

      * In a rare number of COVID deaths (6%), COVID-19 was listed as the
      ***only*** cause/condition of death.

      ## More Context


      The CDC clarified to SmartHER News:


      * 92% of all counted COVID deaths listed COVID-19 as the ***primary***
      underlying cause.

      * In the other 8% of cases, COVID was listed but not as the primary cause.
      Here’s an example: a cancer patient dies with COVID-19. Their primary
      cause of death is cancer, but COVID is listed as a contributing factor.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * To date, the CDC has not analyzed chronic conditions (i.e. hypertension)
      & acute causes (i.e. pneumonia) into separate categories related to
      COVID-19 deaths; both may be listed together on death certificates.

      * **Bottom Line**: This data simply shows that in the majority of COVID-19
      deaths, several factors led to someone’s passing — and in most cases,
      COVID-19 was the primary driver.

      Approximately 80% of COVID-19 deaths in America to date occurred in those
      65 and older. The CDC has emphasized that it's not age alone but
      pre-existing conditions that might be a better gauge for risk level. Older
      people simply tend to have more pre-existing conditions.
