      ## Online Mating?


      * Websites like PollenTree & Modafamily offer a way for people eager to
      have a child to “hook up” with someone to have a baby and co-parent
      with***minus* the dating relationship**.

      * The decision on how to make the baby (surrogate, artificial
      insemination, actual intercourse) is left up to the individuals.

      * The sites also offer a way for men and women looking to donate their
      sperm and eggs to find matches with parents.

      > “They were starting to feel the pressure of the biological clock, still
      single, and looking for a partner they can have a child with, whether they
      were married or not.”


      Modafamily's CEO Ivan Fatovic on why he created the site. He said he was
      inspired to do so by friends who put off having kids to focus on their
      careers.

      > “It’s a controversial approach to creating a family and there are people
      who balk at it, but the idealized version of a man and woman falling in
      love is shortsighted.”


      Jenica Andersen (38), who met the soon-to-be-father of her baby via
      PollenTree. They first talked on the phone, then met in person, and after
      going through medical testing and legal consultations, decided to become
      parents together. Twist of fate? They fell in love (not a promised
      result).

      LOVE American Style? Online mating may be new, but online dating is
      definitely not. 30% of adults have tried it and 12% have been in a
      committed relationship with someone they met online. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
      Are co-parenting websites the logical next step?
