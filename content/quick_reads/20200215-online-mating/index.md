      there are people who balk at it, but the idealized version of a man and
      woman falling in love is shortsighted.”</blockquote><p>Jenica Andersen
      (38), who met the soon-to-be-father of her baby via PollenTree. They first
      talked on the phone, then met in person, and after going through medical
      testing and legal consultations, decided to become parents together. Twist
      of fate? They fell in love (not a promised result).</p></div>

      <div><p>LOVE American Style? Online mating may be new, but online dating
      is definitely not. 30% of adults have tried it and 12% have been in a
      committed relationship with someone they met online. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
      Are co-parenting websites the logical next step?</p><p></p></div>
