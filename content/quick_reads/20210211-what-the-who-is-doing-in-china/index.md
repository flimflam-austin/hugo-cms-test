      <strong>O</strong>rganization spent weeks inside China exploring the
      unknown: the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19.<br><br>Here’s What
      They Learned<br>(And What They Didn’t)</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>BACKSTORY</h2><ul><li>The virus that causes
      <strong>COVID-19</strong> was first recognized in Wuhan,
      China.</li><li>The virus (<strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong>) is genetically
      similar to SARS-CoV – a deadly virus that also emerged in
      China.</li><li>The WHO team spent 4 weeks (incl. 2 in quarantine) in Wuhan
      w/Chinese experts, pouring over research and visiting a market &amp; the
      Wuhan Institute of Virology – sites theorized as potential sources for the
      global pandemic.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The Mission</h2><p>The joint Chinese &amp; WHO team investigated
      4 hypotheses exploring where the new coronavirus came from &amp; how it
      “jumped” to humans.</p><ul><li>Zoonotic: animal-to-human
      transfer.</li><li>Intermediary: animal-to-animal-to-human
      transfer.</li><li>Food chain: frozen food packaging transferring virus to
      humans.</li><li>Lab incidents</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“…since Wuhan is not a city or an environment close to
      bat environments, a direct jump from bats to the city of Wuhan is not very
      likely.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr. Peter Embarek of the World Health
      Organization explained that although investigators believe the first
      "natural reservoir" for COVID-19 is bats, they cannot pinpoint the exact
      animal "reservoir" that may have transferred the virus to humans - despite
      studies on domesticated and wild animals - and called this theory a "work
      in progress."</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2><ul><li>Most likely pathway of the virus is from
      an intermediary animal reservoir to humans – but this needs further
      study.</li><li>Lab incident “extremely unlikely” – joint team advised no
      further study.</li><li>No exact role of the Wuhan animal market identified
      other than early cases spread in the market.</li><li><strong>Bottom Line:
      We still don’t know the origins of SARS-CoV-2.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why Rule Out The Lab?</h2><ul><li>WHO lead investigator says lab
      accidents are “<strong>not impossible</strong>” but “<strong>extremely
      rare</strong>,” and that reported lab security made it “very unlikely
      anything could escape from such a place.”</li><li>Questions remain.
      <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> asked if the Wuhan Institute of Virology
      lab was “genetically altering” existing coronaviruses. WHO didn’t directly
      answer, but said they hope to better clarify claims around any
      studies.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>First blocking investigators &amp; later calling it a
      misunderstanding, the Chinese gov't says the new coronavirus potentially
      started outside China and has focused on imported frozen food as a
      potential source of spread; the WHO has not ruled this out. BIG PICTURE:
      The exact route of transmission for ANY coronavirus, like MERS, has not
      been identified.</p><p></p></div>
