      <div><h2>Why Now?</h2><p>"This is the reality setting in that you’ve got
      to plan this out.”<br><br>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), responding to a
      question about whether the President's declaration that 2,000 U.S. troops
      will withdraw from Syria was a mistake. A day after Pres. Trump's
      announcement, fmr. Sec. of Def Mattis resigned &amp; emphasized the
      importance of America's allies. NS Advisor John Bolton &amp; Sec. Pompeo
      are now meeting with key regional Mideast allies.</p></div>

      <p>"One day he (President Trump) is saying we are in Syria for the long
      term to fight Iran. The next day Trump says we’re leaving in 30 days and
      Iran can do whatever it wants in Syria. It’s impossible to be effective in
      this environment.”<br><br>Ilan Goldenberg, fmr. Obama official, now w/the
      bipartisan nonprofit Center for a New American Security. Sec. Pompeo plans
      to speak about America's Middle East policy while in Cairo - the same city
