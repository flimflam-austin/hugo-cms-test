      Why Is He Going?


      Sec. Pompeo’s 2 declared priorities:


      * U.S. will continue to**battle ISIS,****but change tactics** (withdraw
      troops from Syria, though he sets no timeline. Nat’l Sec. Advisor Bolton
      echoed this sentiment in Israel over the wknd).

      * U.S. will continue to work to**thwart Iran** & its “dangerous”
      activities in the Middle East.

      ## Why Now?


      "This is the reality setting in that you’ve got to plan this out.”  
        
      Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), responding to a question about whether the
      President's declaration that 2,000 U.S. troops will withdraw from Syria
      was a mistake. A day after Pres. Trump's announcement, fmr. Sec. of Def
      Mattis resigned & emphasized the importance of America's allies. NS
      Advisor John Bolton & Sec. Pompeo are now meeting with key regional
      Mideast allies.

      "One day he (President Trump) is saying we are in Syria for the long term
      to fight Iran. The next day Trump says we’re leaving in 30 days and Iran
      can do whatever it wants in Syria. It’s impossible to be effective in this
      environment.”  
        
      Ilan Goldenberg, fmr. Obama official, now w/the bipartisan nonprofit
      Center for a New American Security. Sec. Pompeo plans to speak about
      America's Middle East policy while in Cairo - the same city Pres. Obama
      delivered a speech on the same topic.

      ## YOUR SAFETY AT STAKE


      * **ISIS:** Last week, two Americans were reportedly captured fighting
      with ISIS in Syria – a reminder of the terrorist group’s powerful ideology
      despite loss of territory.

      * **Iran:** Funds terrorist organizations, wants to expand anti-American
      influence in region and is suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons.

      that plots against U.S & plays a role in the terrorist group’s global
      leadership.
