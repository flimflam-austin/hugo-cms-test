      ## RE: A President facing criminal investigations


      > “… a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation
      is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.”  
        
      Kavanaugh in 2009. He went on to say that just as Congress provides a
      "deferral of civil suits" for Presidents, it should consider the same for
      "criminal investigations and prosecutions."

      ## RE: Abortion


      “…the Government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life,

      abortion…. so long as it does not impose an undue burden on a woman
      seeking an abortion.”  
        
      Kavanaugh in a 2017 dissent in a case about whether a detained illegal
      immigrant teen could be released from custody to obtain an abortion.

      Some critics of the Affordable Care Act point the finger at Kavanaugh
      because the Supreme Court echoed his logic from an earlier case regarding
      treating the individual mandate as a tax rather than a penalty when the
      high court upheld the law in 2015.
