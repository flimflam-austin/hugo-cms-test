      ## RECENT HISTORY


      * **Two Weeks Ago:** An American was killed (& others wounded) by rocket
      fire the U.S. blamed on Iran. The U.S. killed approx. 2 dozen members of
      the Iranian-backed militia in Syria & Iraq.

      * **Ten Days Ago:** Violent protest threatened U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

      * **Last Week:** The U.S. killed Iran’s top general (Qasem Soleimani), the
      leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.

      ## CURRENT LAW


      **U.S. CONSTITUTION**: President is the “Commander in Chief” but only
      Congress has power to declare war.


      **WAR POWERS ACT**: Passed in 1973 after the Vietnam War established
      procedures left unanswered in the Constitution about military decisions.
      Requires the President to consult with Congress before deploying (or
      withdrawing) U.S. forces where hostilities are **imminent**.

      ## HOWEVER…


      * The U.S. may attack in “self-defense” **without congressional approva**l
      to stop an upcoming or “**imminent threat**” but not for PAST actions.

      * This is why you’ve heard the White House use the term “imminent” to
      describe the latest attack on the Iranian General; the term carries legal
      weight & validation for not consulting congress.

      * Critics challenge if that was indeed the case, and want to know the
      timeline.

      > “We had specific information on an imminent threat and those included
      attack on US embassies. Period, full stop.”


      Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, Friday January 11th. When pressed to define the
      timeline of an "imminent threat" he added: "We don't know exactly which
      day it would have been executed, but it was very clear. Qasem Soleimani
      himself was plotting a large-scale attack on American interests and those
      attacks were imminent."

      > “At this point in time, the United States has not thus far provided any
      information suggesting that there was an imminent attack against the
      American interest.”


      UN expert on extrajudicial executions Agnès Callamard. Those who question
      the legality point to the evolving narrative from the administration,
      including the Dept. of Defense's statement on the day of the killing that
      said it was "aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans" without more
      urgent, immediate specifics.

      > “If the facts are as the Defense Department said, then the president
      relatively clearly has Article II authority to act in self-defense of
      American lives,”


      University of Texas School of Law professor and international security law
      specialist Bobby Chesney. Pres. Trump revealed Soleimani was targeting 4
      U.S. embassies. Some lawmakers briefed on the intelligence shared by the
      White House say it lacked specifics. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) called it the
      "worst"' briefing he has attended.

      ## Uncharted Territory?


      * Debate over a President’s ability to “eliminate” threats surfaced in the
      past (e.g.: the killing of Osama Bin-Laden).

      * The killing of Gen. Soleimani differs as he was a gov’t official of a
      **country** rather than a terrorist group.

      * **However,** the U.S. designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
      Corps a “foreign terrorist organization” in 2019, the **first time America
      gave this designation** to part of a foreign gov’t.

    body: >-
      This week, in reaction to the targeting of Soleimani, the House of
      Representatives passed a measure voting in favor of limiting Pres. Trump's
      future actions in Iran. It's a largely symbolic vote that passed mostly on
      partly lines. A similar measure is unlikely to pass in the Senate.
