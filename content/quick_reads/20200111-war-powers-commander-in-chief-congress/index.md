      <div><h2>RECENT HISTORY</h2><ul><li><strong>Two Weeks Ago:</strong> An
      American was killed (&amp; others wounded) by rocket fire the U.S. blamed
      on Iran. The U.S. killed approx. 2 dozen members of the Iranian-backed
      militia in Syria &amp; Iraq.</li><li><strong>Ten Days Ago:</strong>
      Violent protest threatened U.S. embassy in Baghdad.</li><li><strong>Last
      Week:</strong> The U.S. killed Iran’s top general (Qasem Soleimani), the
      leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds
      Force.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>CURRENT LAW</h2><p><strong>U.S. CONSTITUTION</strong>: President
      is the “Commander in Chief” but only Congress has power to declare
      war.</p><p><strong>WAR POWERS ACT</strong>: Passed in 1973 after the
      Vietnam War established procedures left unanswered in the Constitution
      about military decisions. Requires the President to consult with Congress
      before deploying (or withdrawing) U.S. forces where hostilities are
      <strong>imminent</strong>.</p></div>

      <div><h2>HOWEVER…</h2><ul><li>The U.S. may attack in “self-defense”
      <strong>without congressional approva</strong>l to stop an upcoming or
      “<strong>imminent threat</strong>” but not for PAST actions.</li><li>This
      is why you’ve heard the White House use the term “imminent” to describe
      the latest attack on the Iranian General; the term carries legal weight
      &amp; validation for not consulting congress.</li><li>Critics challenge if
      that was indeed the case, and want to know the timeline.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We had specific information on an imminent threat and
      those included attack on US embassies. Period, full
      stop.”</blockquote><p>Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, Friday January 11th. When
      pressed to define the timeline of an "imminent threat" he added: "We don't
      know exactly which day it would have been executed, but it was very clear.
      Qasem Soleimani himself was plotting a large-scale attack on American
      interests and those attacks were imminent."</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“At this point in time, the United States has not thus
      far provided any information suggesting that there was an imminent attack
      against the American interest.”</blockquote><p>UN expert on extrajudicial
      executions Agnès Callamard. Those who question the legality point to the
      evolving narrative from the administration, including the Dept. of
      Defense's statement on the day of the killing that said it was "aimed at
      deterring future Iranian attack plans" without more urgent, immediate
      specifics.</p></div>

      the president relatively clearly has Article II authority to act in
      self-defense of American lives,”</blockquote><p>University of Texas School
      of Law professor and international security law specialist Bobby Chesney.
      Pres. Trump revealed Soleimani was targeting 4 U.S. embassies. Some
      lawmakers briefed on the intelligence shared by the White House say it
      lacked specifics. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) called it the "worst"' briefing he
      has attended.</p></div>

      ability to “eliminate” threats surfaced in the past (e.g.: the killing of
      Osama Bin-Laden).</li><li>The killing of Gen. Soleimani differs as he was
      a gov’t official of a <strong>country</strong> rather than a terrorist
      group.</li><li><strong>However,</strong> the U.S. designated Iran’s
      Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a “foreign terrorist organization” in
      2019, the <strong>first time America gave this designation</strong> to
      part of a foreign gov’t.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>This week, in reaction to the targeting of Soleimani, the House of
      Representatives passed a measure voting in favor of limiting Pres. Trump's
      future actions in Iran. It's a largely symbolic vote that passed mostly on
      partly lines. A similar measure is unlikely to pass in the
      Senate.</p><p></p></div>
