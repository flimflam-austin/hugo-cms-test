      ## What To Know:


      * In the last month, the national gas price average rose by almost 40
      cents.

      * As of the date of this publishing (March 18th) the national average is
      up**78 cents since Thanksgiving**, according to AAA.

      * Gas prices have increased since Thanksgiving but have consistently risen
      for the last 10 weeks.

      * Gas prices vary depending on where you live, mostly because of the way
      different states tax gasoline sales.

      > “As Americans turn optimistic on COVID-19 recovery, we’ve been seeing
      insatiable demand for gasoline, which continues to recover far faster than
      oil production.”


      Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, says large oil
      companies had to lay off employees and shutter some facilities in the last
      year due to the pandemic. Companies cannot adjust as quickly as consumers.
      Lower supply + higher demand = higher prices.

      ## Something to Consider:


      Variables factoring into pricing:


      * **Demand –** The price for oil is increasing as the economy is heating
      up again.

      * **Historic winter storm in Texas –** Supply is down as demand is
      increasing; bad weather impacted 1/5 of all U.S. refineries.

      * **Spring Switch –** Refineries have to blend more efficient, less
      volatile, higher-priced fuel in spring/summer due to EPA regs.

      ## One More Thing:


      > “The heating up of what’s commonly understood as a proxy war between
      Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen is just adding to the bullish oil price
      fever.”  
        
      Oil market analyst Louise Dickson, Rystad Energy. Tensions in the Middle
      East add to higher oil prices, which in turn impact prices of gasoline and
      other petroleum byproducts.

      Bottom Line: If you're paying more for gas, that means less money for
      other items. Higher gas prices, creeping up right as Americans are
      receiving stimulus checks, may slow the economic recovery. AAA says gas
      prices may reach $4 a gallon by this summer. GasBuddy.com helps you find
      the cheapest gas - check it out on our source page.
