      James Shaw Jr., the 29-year-old man who wrestled the gun away from the
      shooter, might not consider himself a hero, but the state of Tennessee
      does! The state assembly officially recognized his heroism in a joint
      resolution.

* **SmartHER Take:** The so-called “Waffle House” shooting is the second mass shooting in 2018 where the shooter was KNOWN to law enforcement; the alleged high school shooter in Parkland Florida was also known to local police before his murderous rampage and reported to the FBI through a tipline. We will continue to investigate what led to the identification of these threatening would-be criminals but the inability to stop a horrendous crime.

> _“… no matter his motivations, Mr. Shaw is indeed a hero; his actions on that_  
_fateful morning are unfathomable to most, indescribable by even the chief of police, and veryA_ _poignant to the citizens of Nashville, who are deeply grateful for his brave actions in the face ofA_ _extreme adversity that saved many lives …_  
  
  
  
_… if a hero is ‘a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character,’_  
_then James Shaw, Jr., is a hero twice over, for he has demonstrated both his courage and_  
_character in a manner few could ever attempt to emulate …”_
