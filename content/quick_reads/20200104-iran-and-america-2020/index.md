      ## IMPORTANT CONTEXT:


      * **Iran**: Designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by U.S. State
      Dept.**since 1984.**

      * **State Sponsor of Terrorism** =_“repeatedly provided support for acts
      of international terrorism.”_

      * August 2019: U.S. designates Iran’s paramilitary (Islamic Revolutionary
      Guard Corps) including the Quds Force as a “Foreign Terrorist
      Organization” – first time a “part” of another country’s gov’t received
      this designation.

      ## ALSO IMPORTANT…


      > _“If you see an Iraq war veteran with an artificial limb (or limbs),
      there’s a pretty good chance Soleimani and his Quds Force can take credit
      for the maiming. Iran supplied the IEDs that have penetrated so many of
      our armored vehicles in Iraq.”_

      ## Why This Matters


      Adds fuel to the already simmering tension between America and Iran.
      What’s next? No one knows.


      Suleimani served as a prominent Iranian figure for 20+ years. America
      blames him for orchestrating deaths of hundreds of Americans during the
      Iraq war, and driving nefarious, terrorist activity worldwide.

> _At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization._  
  
  
  
_General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months – including the attack on December 27th – culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week._  
  
  
  
_This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world._

> GEN. MILLEY: We know that there’s been a sustained campaign at least since October. We know that for certain. We know that the campaign has increased in tempo and intensity. So, in October, there were four attacks. In November, there were four to five. In December, today, up until the 27th, there were six attacks.  
  
  
  
We know that the number of rounds have been increasing, from “x” all the way up to 31. We know that the intent of this last attack was in fact to kill American soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, whoever was there. It was about a hundred soldiers at that particular compound.  
  
  
  
Thirty-one rockets aren’t designed as a warning shot. That’s designed to inflict damage and kill. So this has been a sustained campaign by K.H., who is under the influence, command, control, support, training, advice, etcetera, of Iranian special operations forces. So there’s no doubt in our mind as to what happened here.
