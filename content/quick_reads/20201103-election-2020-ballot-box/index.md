      # 2020 BALLOT BOX


      It’s not just about the presidency.


      Here’s a sampling of the 100+ measures – in 32 states and D.C. – which may
      change American life.

      ## BACKGROUND


      * Americans can directly participate in their state’s democratic process
      through ballot measures.

      * Ballot measures take two major forms – either originating through the
      state government of elected officials, OR by voters themselves (who gather
      the requisite number of signatures for a measure to make it onto the
      ballot).

      * We selected a few of the key issues voters will weigh-in on nationwide.

      ## DRUGS


      **Legalizing medicinal marijuana:** Mississippi and South Dakota.


      **Legalizing recreational marijuana:** Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and
      South Dakota.


      **Legalizing psilocybin (aka magic) mushrooms:** Oregon. Meanwhile, a
      ballot measure in D.C. would make psilocybin crimes a “low priority” for
      police.

      ## $$$


      * **California:** Whether to overturn a recently passed law that
      eliminates cash bail and relies on risk assessments when considering
      pre-court release.

      * **Florida:** Whether to raise the minimum wage from $8.56 to $15 by
      2026.

      * **Illinois:** Whether to replace the flat-tax system in place since 1969
      (everyone pays same % regardless of income) with a graduated income tax
      (people who make more would pay more).

      ## ABORTION


      **Colorado:** Whether to ban abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy unless
      needed to save the life of the mother.


      **Louisiana:** Whether to amend the state constitution to add language
      declaring that nothing in the constitution should be interpreted as
      protecting the right to or funding of an abortion. Otherwise, the state
      constitution would remain as is – w/o specific language on abortion
      rights.

      ## “EDITING” THE PAST


      * **Alabama:** Whether to allow the state gov’t to remove “racist
      language” from the state’s 119-year-old constitution.

      * **California:** Whether to allow affirmative action policies, undoing a
      1996 ban on use of race and sex consideration in hiring & university
      admissions.

      * **Utah:** Whether to remove gender-specific language from the state
      constitution, meaning phrases like “all men” would be edited to “all
      people.”

      California voters will weigh in on a ballot measure to decide whether
      rideshare and delivery drivers who work for app-based businesses (ex:
      Uber) should continue to be treated as independent contractors - exempting
      them from a law that would treat them as employees (with workplace
      protections, like minimum wage).
