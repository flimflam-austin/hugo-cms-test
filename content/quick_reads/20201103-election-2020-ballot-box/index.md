      <div><h2>BACKGROUND</h2><ul><li>Americans can directly participate in
      their state’s democratic process through ballot measures.</li><li>Ballot
      measures take two major forms – either originating through the state
      government of elected officials, OR by voters themselves (who gather the
      requisite number of signatures for a measure to make it onto the
      ballot).</li><li>We selected a few of the key issues voters will weigh-in
      on nationwide.</li></ul></div>

      marijuana:</strong> Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South
      Dakota.</p><p><strong>Legalizing psilocybin (aka magic)
      mushrooms:</strong> Oregon. Meanwhile, a ballot measure in D.C. would make
      psilocybin crimes a “low priority” for police.</p></div>

      a recently passed law that eliminates cash bail and relies on risk
      assessments when considering pre-court
      release.</li><li><strong>Florida:</strong> Whether to raise the minimum
      wage from $8.56 to $15 by 2026.</li><li><strong>Illinois:</strong> Whether

      abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy unless needed to save the life of

      constitution to add language declaring that nothing in the constitution
      should be interpreted as protecting the right to or funding of an
      abortion. Otherwise, the state constitution would remain as is – w/o
      specific language on abortion rights.</p></div>

      sex consideration in hiring &amp; university
      admissions.</li><li><strong>Utah:</strong> Whether to remove
      gender-specific language from the state constitution, meaning phrases like

      whether rideshare and delivery drivers who work for app-based businesses
      (ex: Uber) should continue to be treated as independent contractors -
