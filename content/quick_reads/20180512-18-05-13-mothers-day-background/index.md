      <div><p>By the 1920s, mothers nationwide were showered with candy,
      flowers, cards, &amp; other gifts to celebrate Mother’s Day.</p><p>Jarvis,
      frustrated with the commercialization of the holiday, that she intended as
      a day to <strong>honor the role mothers play in the family, church, and
      community</strong>, spent the rest of her life fighting against its
      commercial success.</p></div>
