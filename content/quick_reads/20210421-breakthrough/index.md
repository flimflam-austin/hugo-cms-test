      <div><h2>What Is "Breakthrough?"</h2><h6>"Vaccine breakthrough" - a case
      when a person <strong>tests positive</strong> for the SARS-CoV-2 virus
      (either by a PCR or rapid antigen test) more than two weeks after
      receiving a full series of a COVID-19 vaccine (either one or two doses,
      depending on the vaccine).</h6><h6>A case represents a TEST that's
      positive, not necessarily someone who has symptoms.</h6></div>

      <div><blockquote>"These vaccines are working."</blockquote><p>CDC Director
      Dr. Walenksy says while the data is likely underestimating the number of
      breakthrough cases (in part because only 43 states and territories
      reported) she says the fact nearly 30% of the cases had no symptoms is
      "encouraging news," saying that this shows the vaccines are helpful in
      preventing severe disease. The CDC Dir. says rare breakthrough cases are
      expected with any vaccine.</p></div>

      <div><p>"If you're asymptomatic and you are vaccinated, you would not be
      likely to be presenting to get tested."</p><p>Associate professor of
      epidemiology Bill Hanage, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health,
      explaining another reason why the number of "breakthrough" infections is
      likely an underestimate. Epidemiologists say as community spread
      decreases, so too will instances of breakthrough infections - while also
      warning no COVID-19 vaccine has 100% efficacy.</p></div>

      <p>Unlike some other vaccines in use, such as the chickenpox vaccine, none
      of the vaccines approved for emergency use contain a LIVE coronavirus that
      would lead to a positive COVID-19 test. Questions remain over the rate at
      which a vaccinated individual potentially could still transmit the virus
      that causes COVID-19.</p>
