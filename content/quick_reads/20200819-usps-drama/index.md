      <div><h2>USPS</h2><p>United States Postal Service</p><p>Unofficial creed:
      <em>“Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these
      couriers from the swift completion of their appointed
      rounds.”</em></p><p>“The Postal Service receives NO tax dollars for
      operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and
      services to fund its operations.” (USPS)</p></div>

      <div><h2>Important Background</h2><ul><li>The USPS is a <strong>financial
      mess.</strong></li><li>Why? Less business &amp; huge liabilities (debt,
      pensions, etc.). <strong>It lost $78B from
      2007-2019.</strong></li><li><strong>Your state determines how you
      vote.</strong> The federal government <strong>DOES NOT administer
      elections – state election boards do.</strong> The federal gov’t has
      oversight over the USPS which assists delivery of absentee &amp; mail-in
      ballots on a state level.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>A 2020 Warning</h2><ul><li><strong>Mail-in ballots and delays
      surged during COVID-19 elections</strong>; Two of NY’s June congressional
      races took 6 weeks for final count.</li><li>Some state election boards are
      trying to make mail-in ballots more accessible in part to enable voters to
      avoid crowds.</li><li>In July, USPS warned 40+ state election offices to
      plan for potential delays and recommended they send ballots to voters as
      early as possible.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Whats Happening Now?</h2><ul><li>The House of Representatives,
      led by Democrats, <strong>carved out $25B for USPS</strong> as part of an
      emergency economic stimulus bill to cushion the blow of the COVID-19
      pandemic, <strong>PLUS $3.6B to states to help manage the
      election.</strong></li><li>Pres. Trump calls this funding a “bailout” – an
      unnecessary add-on. Pres. alleges Democrats want to increase mail-in
      voting in order to tilt the election against him and risk voter
      fraud.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>And then there’s this…</h2><ul><li>A new Postmaster General,
      Louis DeJoy, took over in June.</li><li>DeJoy is a businessman and
      Republican donor who has promised to help USPS cut costs and shore-up
      finances.</li><li>Democrats accuse him of purposefully cutting resources
      right when the nation needs it most, and asked the FBI to investigate. He
      denies any wrongdoing and postponed any changes until after the
      election.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Nice try, Postmaster General DeJoy, but the House will
      still be passing our bill to ensure the delivery of the mail through the
      election. We will deliver for America by voting on Saturday.
      #DontMessWithUSPS”</blockquote><p>House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) called her
      colleagues back to D.C. (they were expected to be in their districts until
      September) to vote on a bill prohibiting any proposed changes to USPS's
      operations and service standards until the COVID-19 pandemic is
      over.</p></div>

      ballots…They’re being lost, they’re being discarded. They’re finding them
      in piles. It’s going to be a catastrophe. So — and this is beyond the Post
      Office.”</blockquote><p>Pres. Trump alleging Democrats want funding for
      Post Office to increase mail-in voting that will favor them. The
      President's critics accuse him of voter suppression for his unwillingness
      to give additional money to the USPS.</p></div>

      <div><p>unions calls the potential challenge of extra votes a "piece of
      cake" with proper planning. The fate of the bill remains TBD. A previous
      COVID-19 economic stimulus bill granted a $10B loan to the USPS. The USPS
      has repeatedly borrowed from the Treasury in recent
      years.</p><p></p></div>
