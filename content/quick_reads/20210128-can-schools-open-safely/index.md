      ## New Study: The Basics


      * **What**: 17 schools participated in a study examining in-school
      transmission of COVID-19 over the course of 13 weeks.

      * **Where**: A rural Wisconsin county.

      * **When**: Late August to late November.

      * **Who**: 4,876 students and 654 staff members. 8 elementary schools
      (K-6); 9 secondary schools (grades 7-12).

      * Public and private school districts, including 1 independent school.

      ## Parameters for Participants


      * Each student received 3-5 masks with 2-3 layers (funded by grant money)
      and wore masks in school; there were district and statewide mask mandates
      in place at the time.

      * Students stayed in cohorts of 11-20 students; if possible, students
      consistently sat next to the same person.

      * Social distancing recommended.

      * **All classes and lunch held indoors.**

      ## The Rules


      If a student tested positive and quarantined, their siblings *also*
      automatically quarantined (length of quarantine not specified in study).


      If a student/staff tested positive, anyone with close contact (sitting
      within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more) automatically quarantined.

      ## What Happened?


      * 133 students and 58 staff members tested positive for COVID-19.

      * 3.7% of cases (7 cases – all students) were tied to in-school
      transmission.

      * No known child-to-staff member transmission.

      * **Context**: Researchers say despite_“widespread community
      transmission”_ in the county overall, these schools had a 37% lower
      infection rate than the surrounding community.

      ## Bottom Line


      _“These findings suggest that, with proper mitigation strategies, K–12
      schools might be capable of opening for in-person learning with minimal
      in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”_  
        
      The CDC research team notes mitigation and masking efforts, and
      acknowledges the study has demographic, regional and technical
      limitations.

      ## Something to Consider


      * An estimated 56+ million Americans are in school K-12.

      * About half of American schooling remains virtual (as of the study date).

      * Just over half of teachers in this study participated in the weekly
      surveys (on mask compliance, class attendance), which limits some of the
      data.

      * Researchers did**not** proactively test students and staff for COVID-19
      to identify any asymptomatic cases.

      Are kids safer in school? The study stops short of saying definitely,
      using the word "might" 14 times. Additional limitations to the study:
      Participants were mostly non-Hispanic white in a rural, middle-to-low
      income area. Available data showed mask compliance was over 90% regardless
      of grade; school ventilation systems were not studied.
