      “The night before (the shooter) opened fire in a courtyard at YouTube’s
      headquarters Tuesday afternoon, Mountain View police found the San Diego
      woman sleeping in her car. She had been reported missing by her family in
      Southern California, and her father Ismail Aghdam told police she might be
      going to YouTube because she ‘hated’ the company.”
