      # PAUSE


      ### The U.S. has recommended a pause on use of the Johnson & Johnson
      vaccine.


      ### Here’s Why:

      ## **The Basics**


      * FDA & CDC report 6 cases of “rare and severe” blood clots in women ages
      18-48, causing “severe stroke-like illness.”

      * Symptoms: 6-13 days after dose.

      * 1 case was fatal; 1 patient is in critical condition.

      * Condition “very similar” to “another vaccine in Europe.”

      * Officials did not name AstraZeneca, but concerns *have* surfaced about
      blood clotting and the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe.

      ## **Why Is It Happening?**


      The FDA isn’t certain, but offered this:


      * A focus is the adenoviral vector vaccines. The J&J vaccine uses a shell
      of an adenovirus (called adenoviral vectors) as a “delivery vehicle” for
      the vaccine into your body. AstraZeneca uses a similar technology.

      * Doctors say that in some cases the body’s immune response to the
      adenovirus may lead to this very rare condition.

      ## **The Risk**


      * This condition occurred in 6 cases out of the more than 6.8 million J&J
      doses administered (remember, J&J is a single-dose vaccine).

      * If you received vaccine more than a month ago, health officials say risk
      of developing this condition is very low.

      * If you received it recently (last 3 weeks), be mindful of symptoms -
      such as**severe** headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, & shortness of
      breath.

      ## **A Little Bit More**


      ###### Right now, the condition doesn’t appear to be related to birth
      control (birth control pills can raise risk of blood clotting) but women
      under 50 remain the focus.


      ###### It’s not***just*** blood clotting – it’s blood clotting WITH a
      condition of low platelets (thrombocytopenia – which can actually cause
      severe internal bleeding).

      ## **Big Picture**


      > “We are totally aware that this is a very rare event. We want to get
      this worked out as quickly as we possibly can. And that’s why you see the
      word ‘pause.'"


      White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on why the FDA & CDC
      is recommending (not mandating) the pause out of an "abundance of caution"
      while the FDA & CDC investigate and consider next steps.

      Typical treatment (i.e.: heparin) for blood clots can actually make this
      condition more dangerous. The govt. says over 122 million people have
      received at least one vaccine dose. Dr. Fauci says this particular type of
      clotting condition has not been detected in connection with the Moderna &
      Pfizer vaccines.
