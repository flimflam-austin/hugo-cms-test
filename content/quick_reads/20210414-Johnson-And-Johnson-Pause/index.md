      <div><h1>PAUSE </h1><h3>The U.S. has recommended a pause on use of the
      Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. </h3><h3>Here’s Why:</h3></div>

      <div><h2><strong>The Basics</strong></h2><ul><li>FDA &amp; CDC report 6
      cases of “rare and severe” blood clots in women ages 18-48, causing
      “severe stroke-like illness.” </li><li>Symptoms: 6-13 days after dose.
      </li><li>1 case was fatal; 1 patient is in critical condition.
      </li><li>Condition “very similar” to “another vaccine in Europe.”
      </li><li>Officials did not name AstraZeneca, but concerns *have* surfaced
      about blood clotting and the AstraZeneca vaccine in
      Europe.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2><strong>Why Is It Happening? </strong></h2><p>The FDA isn’t
      certain, but offered this: </p><ul><li>A focus is the adenoviral vector
      vaccines. The J&amp;J vaccine uses a shell of an adenovirus (called
      adenoviral vectors) as a “delivery vehicle” for the vaccine into your
      body. AstraZeneca uses a similar technology. </li><li>Doctors say that in
      some cases the body’s immune response to the adenovirus may lead to this
      very rare condition.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2><strong>The Risk</strong></h2><ul><li>This condition occurred in
      6 cases out of the more than 6.8 million J&amp;J doses administered
      (remember, J&amp;J is a single-dose vaccine).</li><li>If you received
      vaccine more than a month ago, health officials say risk of developing
      this condition is very low.</li><li>If you received it recently (last 3
      weeks), be mindful of symptoms - such as <strong>severe</strong> headache,
      abdominal pain, leg pain, &amp; shortness of breath.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2><strong>A Little Bit More </strong></h2><h6>Right now, the
      condition doesn’t appear to be related to birth control (birth control
      pills can raise risk of blood clotting) but women under 50 remain the
      focus. </h6><h6>It’s not <strong>*just*</strong> blood clotting – it’s
      blood clotting WITH a condition of low platelets (thrombocytopenia – which
      can actually cause severe internal bleeding).</h6></div>

      <div><h2><strong>Big Picture </strong></h2><blockquote>“We are totally
      aware that this is a very rare event. We want to get this worked out as
      quickly as we possibly can. And that’s why you see the word ‘pause.'"
      </blockquote><p>White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on why
      the FDA &amp; CDC is recommending (not mandating) the pause out of an
      "abundance of caution" while the FDA &amp; CDC investigate and consider
      next steps.</p></div>

      <p>Typical treatment (i.e.: heparin) for blood clots can actually make
      this condition more dangerous. The govt. says over 122 million people have
      received at least one vaccine dose. Dr. Fauci says this particular type of
      clotting condition has not been detected in connection with the Moderna
      &amp; Pfizer vaccines.</p>
