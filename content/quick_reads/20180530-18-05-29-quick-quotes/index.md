      QUICK QUOTES  

      Natural Disaster Edition


      > “Ten minutes later we get the call and it was them.”  
        
      Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant on the deaths of journalists Mike
      McCormick & Aaron Smeltzer in North Carolina. A tree fell on their vehicle
      shortly after they interviewed him as part of their Alberto storm
      coverage. A Gulf of Mexico storm in May is very rare; it's only happened 3
      times on record.

      Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman on the aftermath for a small
      Maryland community in Ellicott City where devastating flash flooding has

      > “I think it’s safe to say authorities have been concerned about the flow
      of lava onto the plant property since the eruption started.”  
        
      David Mace, FEMA spokesman as lava from Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano covered
      one of the wells at the island's geothermal power plant, prompting fears
      of a toxic gas leak. Authorities urge residents to evacuate the area due
      to fast-moving flows.
