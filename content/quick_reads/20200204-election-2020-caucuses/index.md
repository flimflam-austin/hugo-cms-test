      ## What’s A Caucus?


      * Oxford Definition:_A private meeting of the leaders or representatives
      of a political party, previous to an election or to a general meeting of
      the party, to select candidates for office …_

      * Oxford says its origins are “obscure” but some say it was a Native
      American term for a meeting of tribal leaders.

      * Word dates back to 1700s in Boston, but caucuses have been used in
      America since at least the 1800s.

      ## Caucus 101:


      * **Caucuses vs. Primary Elections:** One big difference? Who runs the
      operation: primaries are run by the individual states (often like general
      elections with secret ballots), whereas caucuses are run by the parties.

      * **2020:** Three states (Iowa, Nevada, Wyoming) & four U.S. territories
      (Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa) will hold
      caucuses this year.

      ## About The Iowa Caucuses:


      * Voters registered with a party gather at 1,600+ precincts at 7pm.

      * **Democrats:** Gather in groups based on the candidate they support –
      only candidates that get at least 15% get awarded delegates. Whoever gets
      the most delegates is the winner.

      * **Republicans:** After 3-5 min. speeches in support of each candidate,
      they votes via paper. Whoever gets the most votes is the winner.

      ## Why Does Iowa Matter?


      * It’s**first** so it provides the first look at how real voters (albeit
      the most politically active ones) will *actually* vote (not polls about
      their opinions).

      * For**Democrats** in particular, whoever wins in Iowa tends to go on to
      secure the Dem pres. nomination. Ex: 6 of the party’s last 10 nominees won
      in Iowa.

      * Winning Iowa can be**game-changer** for lesser known candidates (Jimmy
      Carter in 1976; Barack Obama in 2008).

      BIG PICTURE: Iowa is not necessarily a predictor for November's winner (or
      loser). Since Iowa held the first caucuses in 1972, only three winners (2
      Democrats & 1 Republican) went on to win the presidency.
