      ## WHO KEEPS OUR NATION’S TOP SECRETS?


      > **4+ million Americans have security clearances.**  

      **President Trump revoked 1**.  
        
      Why some say stripping former CIA Dir. John Brennan of his clearance is an
      attack on free speech, while others say it had to be done.


      BIGGER PICTURE

      ## Who Keeps Clearance?


      * **Who**: Former federal employees who had on the job security
      clearances.

      * **Why**: In case a need arises when he or she can be of use to the
      current administration.

      * **How long**: Clearance continues (with periodic reviews) as long as
      person avoids sharing classified info, getting into debt, & traveling to
      certain parts of the world, etc.

      ## Bigger Picture:


      * Current *Security Clearance* system deemed “high risk” by gov’t
      watchdog.

      * Too many people have security clearances (est. 1.4M at “top secret”
      level) & continual reviews of their eligibility are inconsistent.

      * Evaluations take too long. More than 700,000 people waiting for security
      clearance, according to most recent estimates.

      ## John Brennan’s Response:


      > “This action is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress
      freedom of speech & punish critics.A It should gravely worry all
      Americans, including intelligence professionals, about the cost of
      speaking out. My principles are worth far more than clearances. I will not
      relent.”

      The topic of revoking security clearances came up several weeks ago when
      some, like Brennan criticized the President's meeting with Vladimir Putin.
      Is Brennan sowing "division & chaos" or exercising free speech? Does
      social media change the equation?

* **SOMETHING TO CONSIDER:** Deputy Dir of the CIA, Mike Morrell, says the argument officials use classified information to criticize the administration doesn’t work because…”Senators and Congressman have security clearances. Senators and Congressman know classified information. And they talk to the media all the time too.” Listen to more here:
