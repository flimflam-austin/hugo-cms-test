      Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" is back at #1 on Billboard's Hot
      100 more than 25 years since its release. Carey now has more time at #1
      than any other artist, including The Beatles. She's also the only artist
      with a Hot 100 #1 in 4 different decades. BTW... She didn't even *want* to
      do a Christmas album in 1994 when she ended up writing her now-famous
      anthem.
