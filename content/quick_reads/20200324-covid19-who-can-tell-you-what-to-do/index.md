      federal government is to prevent the spread of highly contagious diseases
      into the country &amp; in between states.</li><li>The federal gov’t may
      limit entry into the U.S., order those inside the U.S. to remain under
      quarantine and/or isolation, and restrict interstate travel.</li><li>The

      spread of diseases within their borders.</li><li>States may order their
      own quarantines or less-extreme measures (ex: stay-at-home orders).
      Generally, federal orders supersede state &amp; local

      but the goal of each is the same: to mandate social
      distancing.</li><li>Generally, the orders require most residents to avoid
      leaving home except for necessary activities: i.e., to access medical
      care, obtain must-have items (ex: food), or run essential errands (ex:
      walk the dog).</li><li>Stay-at-home violations are usually
      misdemeanors.</li></ul></div>

      lead</strong> in the case of <strong>widespread communicable
      diseases</strong> but needs teamwork from the states.</p><p>The policies
      put into place recognize states are in the best position to know how to
      serve their own needs. For example, the federal gov’t is deploying
      National Guard troops to 3 states, but each state’s governor is directing
      them.</p></div>
