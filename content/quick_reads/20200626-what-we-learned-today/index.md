      <div><h2>Preexisting Conditions</h2><ul><li>The CDC expanded the list of
      preexisting conditions that make you more vulnerable to COVID-19,
      emphasizing that THESE, not <em>necessarily</em> age (though the elderly
      are more prone to preexisting conditions) are crucial factors in severe
      cases.</li><li>60% of Americans have <strong>at least one</strong>
      preexisting condition.</li><li>Obesity is among the most prevalent – 40%
      of Americans are obese.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Pregnancy</h2><ul><li>Pregnant women with COVID-19 are more
      likely to be hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, and require a ventilator
      than women who are not pregnant.</li><li>However, right now, pregnant
      women are not at a higher risk of death.</li><li>Information on the
      lingering impacts of COVID-19 on the unborn remain unknown. The CDC says
      after 5 mos of the pandemic, they simply don’t have information on
      full-term pregnancies.</li></ul></div>

      <strong>10 additional cases for each *known* case</strong> of COVID-19 in
      America,</p><p>Consequently, the CDC estimates a small portion of the
      entire nation – <strong>under 8%</strong> – have been exposed to
      COVID-19.</p><p>CDC Dir. Dr. Redfield says estimates for
      <strong>asymptomatic spread</strong> are btwn 20-80%.</p><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>Dr. Redfield says in March, about 27% or 1 in 4 deaths in America
      were attributed to a pneumonia, flu or COVID-19; now the percentage is
      more "normal," around 7%. Still he says this latest "significant increase"
      of cases is important and still part of the "first wave" of this pandemic
      in America.</p><p></p></div>
