      “Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to ensure the best results.
      Good judgment, with experience, has taught some to measure by sight; but
      the majority need definite guides.”


      Fannie Merritt Farmer, "The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book" (1896).
      Before her cookbook, recipes used general measurements such as "a handful"
      instead of "1 cup." Farmer, who admitted to not being the most skilled
      cook, believed precision was the key to success in the kitchen.

      Why She Matters:


      * Farmer wanted everyone, no matter their occupation, to understand the
      science of nutrition.

      * She has been “widely credited with inventing the modern recipe” (NYT)
      and is one of the few American women whose cooking influence has spread
      worldwide.

      * In 1902, she founded Miss Farmer’s School of Cookery. It operated &
      trained chefs for about 40 years.

      Farmer’s Legacy


      * Her cookbook is in its 13th edition & can still be found in stores today
      under its updated title, _“The Fannie Farmer Cookbook”._

      * She is accredited with publishing one of the **first chocolate brownie
      recipes.**

      * Julia Child, another widely-known American cook, regularly referred to
      _“The Fannie Farmer Cookbook”_ while growing up and followed it for
      recipes such as fudge & pancakes.

      21.5 million printed cookbooks were sold in 2020 as people opted for more
      meals at home amidst the pandemic - a 17% increase compared to 2019. But
      whom do we have to thank for the modern day recipe - whether in a cookbook
      or online? Fannie Farmer, the Boston cook who was born on this day in
      1857.
