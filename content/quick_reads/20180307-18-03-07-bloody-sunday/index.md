      ## “Bloody Sunday”


      On March 7, peaceful civil rights marchers were violently attacked by
      police as they began a 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama
      aimed at ending discriminatory laws & practices used against African
      Americans to prevent them from voting.

      ## Why Did This Happen?


      * After slavery was abolished a century earlier, Congress passed the 15th
      Amendment, which guaranteed that the right to vote could not be denied on
      the basis of race, color or prior servitude.

      * Yet, many states passed laws and employed practices to get around the
      15th Amendment, like poll taxes, literacy exams, fraud, & intimidation.

      ## “Bloody Sunday”


      * Nearly 600 nonviolent activists marched for six blocks before they were
      attacked by police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

      * That night, the nation watched the horrific scene unfold on t.v.

      * Two days later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a “symbolic” march to
      the bridge.

      * Three weeks later, 3,000+ set out for Montgomery;A 25,000 arrived.

      ## Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) shared his “Bloody Sunday” memories with TIME
      Magazine in 2017:


      “They came toward us with nightsticks, beating us, pushing us, trampling
      us with horses, and releasing the tear gas. I was hit in the head by a
      state trooper with a nightstick. . . . “

      ## Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) shared his “Bloody Sunday” memories with TIME
      Magazine in 2017:


      “I suffered a concussion on the bridge, and I thought I was going to die
      that day. I saw death. Fifty years later, I still don’t remember how I
      made it through the streets of Selma back to Brown Chapel that evening.”

      ## A week later, Pres. Lyndon Johnson told Congress:


      “There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no
      Northern problem. There is only an American problem. . . . What happened
      in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section
      and State of America. . . .A And we shall overcome.”

      ## Five months later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act


      In August 1965, Pres. Johnson signed the Act, which prohibited
      discrimination in voting & gave the federal gov’t a way to enforce the
      15th Amendment against the states.


      By 1969, the percent of voting-age African Americans registered to vote
      nearly tripled.
