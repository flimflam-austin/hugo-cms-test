      <div><h1>BIG PICTURE</h1><ul><li>Between 2001-2015, overall # of reported
      crimes on college campuses dropped by 34% EXCEPT the # of forcible sex
      offenses increased by 262%.</li><li>Some say victims need broad
      guidelines; others say the broad guidelines cast too wide of a net. The
      Dept of Ed. believes the latter. Proposed rules would apply for K-12 &amp;
      higher education.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Proposed New Rules</h2><p>A year after rescinding Obama-era rules
      on how schools handle sex misconduct allegations citing federal overreach,
      the Dept. of Ed. revealed proposed rules, which:</p><ul><li>Require a
      higher <strong>standard of proof</strong> for evaluating
      accusations.</li><li>Allow accused students to
      <strong>cross-examine</strong> their accusers (using a
      representative).</li></ul></div>

      DEFINITION:</strong> ‘unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so
      severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access
      to the school’s education program or activity.’</li></ul></div>

      <blockquote>“… my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every
      student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment. That starts with
      having <strong>clear policies and fair processes that every student can
      rely on.</strong> Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken
      seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that
      guilt is not predetermined.”<br><br>Sec. of Education Betsy

      sexual assault on campuses,</strong> and cases of false accusations are
      exceedingly rare. But when you hear folks in the current administration
      talk about issues of sexual harassment or assault, what one hears from
      them is <strong>the implication that false accusations are a rampant
      problem and that is false."</strong><br><br><br><br>Fmr. Sec. of Education
