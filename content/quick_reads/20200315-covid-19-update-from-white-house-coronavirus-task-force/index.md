      > “We have not reached our peak… We will see more cases and we will see
      more suffering and death.”


      Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
      Infectious Diseases, reiterating that the U.S. has YET to see the height
      of COVID-19, noting that the most vulnerable are the elderly and those
      with underlying conditions. Nonetheless, as pointed out by U.S. Surgeon
      General Dr. Jerome Adams, "almost all people will recover - 98, 99% of
      people will recover."

      Pres. Trump's advice to the American people. The ban against entry into
      the U.S. from 26 European countries went into effect on Friday. On Monday,
      the United Kingdom and Ireland will be added to the list. U.S. citizens
      and green card holders are exempt from the ban. Pres. Trump said the U.S.
      is *ALSO* considering domestic travel restrictions.

      numbers are for people who are asymptotic.”  
        
      Dr. Deborah Birx, White House COVID-19 coordinator, explaining that
      although we know a lot about the high risk of serious illness to older
      Americans, we don't know enough yet about transmission, specifically, how
      many are carrying COVID-19 that show no symptoms, but are spreading it.
      BIG unknown: Are people under 20 asymptomatic and spreading the virus?

      > Vice President Pence on the stimulus deal that passed the House and is
      on its way to the Senate on Monday, which has several provisions,
      including free coronavirus testing, two weeks of emergency paid sick leave

      nutrition programs for students and low-income persons.

      protect the 30-year-old or the 20-year-old from getting coronavirus.
      They’re to protect your nana.”


      U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams on why people of ALL ages need to
      contribute to the efforts to overcome COVID-19. Dr. Adams' prescription:
      "know your risk, understand your circumstances, and get the facts to
      protect yourself at coronavirus.gov."

      What's Next? Treasury secretary Steve Munchkin suggested that other
      stimulus ideas are on the table, such as a payroll tax cut, refundable tax
      credits, suspending interest on student loans, and using the strategic oil
      reserves. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE U.S. RESPONSE TO COVID-19?
