      ## Why It Matters


      Royal tradition adopted in the U.S. Started with Sec. of State Henry Clay
      in 1852. Today, the decision to bestow the honor is made by Congress.


      11 U.S Presidents have lain in state: Ford, Reagan, Johnson, Eisenhower,
      Hoover, Kennedy, Taft, Harding, McKinley, Garfield, & Lincoln.

    body: "## Shared Support\n\n* Catafalque:\_a frame that supports a coffin (cat-e-falk).\n* Pres. Lincoln’s catafalque from 1865 has held most of the coffins that have lain in state.\n* The catafalque has had minor restorations since 1865 (retrofitted to hold larger coffins, drapery replaced), but for the most part, it remains like the original."

    body: "## “In State” vs. “In Honor”\n\nAverage citizens cannot “lie in state” as that honor is reserved for\_gov’t & military officials.\n\nHowever, eminent private citizens may “lie in honor.”\n\nTo date, only four have received the honor — including two police officers killed during an attack on the U.S. Capitol & Rev. Billy Graham."

      In 2005, civil rights activist Rosa Parks became the first (and only)
      woman to "lie in honor" in the U.S. Capitol. Congressman Lewis, who passed
      last week, is only the second African-American lawmaker to receive this
      honor after Congressman Elijah Cummings in October.
