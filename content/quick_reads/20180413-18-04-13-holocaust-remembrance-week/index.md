* New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States: [www.claimscon.org/study](http://www.claimscon.org/study)

> “The survey found there are critical gaps both in awareness of basic facts as well as detailed knowledge of the Holocaust, and there is a broad-based consensus that schools must be responsible for providing comprehensive Holocaust education.A In addition, a significant majority of American adults believe that fewer people care about the Holocaust today than they used to, and more than half of Americans believe that the Holocaust could happen again.”
