      <p>“We cannot take the risk when we know the threat.”<br><br>France's
      Culture Minister Franck Riester on plans to close the Eiffel Tower and
      Louvre Museum Saturday due to planned protests. The riots, now entering
      their 4th week, have grown increasingly violent. Protestors have also
      sprayed graffiti on famous French landmarks. The French gov't has
      cancelled plans for a fuel tax increase, but protestors vow to continue,
      fighting what they say is a high cost of living in France &amp; a gov't
      that favors the rich.</p>

      <blockquote>“What this week and a half shows is an extraordinary
      sensitivity to headlines, more so than usual.”<br><br>Delores Rubin,
      Deutsche Bank Wealth Management senior equities trader, as stocks fell
      nearly 800 points before bouncing back Thursday. Concerns of a US-China
      trade stalemate weighed on investors, but stocks rebounded on news the

      <blockquote>"We still want Russia to cut as much as possible…A I’m not
      confident, but I hope to reach a deal.”<br><br>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister
      Khalid Al-Falih as OPEC fails to reach a consensus on how much oil the
      15-nation group will produce for the next 6 months. Saudi Arabia wants to
      cut production by 1M barrels per day to stop oil's price slide but the
      group is waiting for Russia, a non-OPEC member, to commit. Oil prices
      dropped by the most in 2 weeks on the news. OPEC will meet again
      Friday.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“All of a sudden we started skidding, and then he started
      braking even more aggressively and then he was like,
      ‘brake!'”<br><br>Yvonne Dorr, Southwest Airlines passenger on a flight
      from Oakland to Burbank, after the 737 skidded off the runway to a sharp
      stop, just short of a CA freeway during a rainstorm. Cement blocks &amp;
      sand-like ground material prevented the plane from overshooting even
      further. No one was injured.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“I just about fainted. I’ve never touched that much money and
      I don’t think I ever will again.”<br><br>Kevin Booth (32), a homeless man
      in Seattle, who found $17,000 in a bag outside of a food bank and turned
      it in. The food bank turned the money over to police who held it for the
      required 90 days, but no one claimed it so they returned it to the food
      bank, which gave a portion of it back to Booth to thank him for his
      honesty.</blockquote>
