_Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido._

_We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair._

_Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. A America was founded on liberty and independence a\u0013- not government coercion, domination, and control.A We are born free, and we will stay free.A Tonight, weA renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country._
