      > “America was founded on liberty and independence - not government
      coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay
      free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist
      country.”


      Pres. Trump during the 2019 State of the Union. After championing his
      economic policies, he described the socialist policies in Venezuela as
      turning that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a
      state of abject poverty and despair.

      ## Socialism Defined


      > “social & economic doctrine that calls for public rather than private
      ownership or control of property and natural resources….in opposition to
      capitalism, which is based on private ownership of the means of production
      & allows individual choices in a free market…”

      ## Why Is It A Hot Topic Now?


      * Leading Democrat politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders & Rep. Alexandra
      Ocasio-Cortez are “**Democrat Socialists**” advocating for medicare for
      all & higher taxes on rich for the greater good.

      * Democrats who do not describe themselves as “socialist” share some
      platforms such as**national healthcare.** Critics say party is moving too
      far left or “socialist.”

      ## Politics at Play


      **Preview 2020 President Race**


      The President set the stage for further debate:**Republican-led economy
      vs. the Democrat’s so-called “socialist” agenda.**


      **Two Parties Already At Odds:** More Democrats have a favorable view on
      socialism than capitalism; Republicans = the opposite. (Gallup)

      According to recent polling, young Americans (18-29) view socialism more
      favorably than capitalism (this is typical of this age group although
      socialism has increased in favorability in recent years). Overall
      Americans' positive view on socialism remains less than 40%.

_Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido._

_We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair._

_Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. A America was founded on liberty and independence a\u0013- not government coercion, domination, and control.A We are born free, and we will stay free.A Tonight, weA renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country._
