      <div><h1>Pandemic vs. Peace</h1><p>While the U.S. embraces “wartime”

      <div><h2>Backstory</h2><p>On February 29, America announced the framework
      for a “peace deal” with the Taliban, effectively providing a pathway to
      ending America’s longest war.</p><p>In exchange for the eventual
      withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Taliban agreed to cut ties with terrorist
      groups like al-Qaeda, negotiate with the current Afghan government, and
      “reduce violence.”</p></div>

      <div><p>“Both sides should accelerate efforts to meet targets specified in
      the US-Taliban agreement as soon as possible. The potential for COVID-19
      outbreaks in prisons poses a real threat and all the more reason to move
      urgently.”</p><p>U.S. Special Rep for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay
      Khalilzad, on prisoner release plans as part of "peace deal." Reportedly,
      up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners are set to be released by the Afghan gov't
      while the Taliban is set to release 1,000 Afghan prisoners.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Why This Matters</h2><ul><li>Progress has been slow after the
      “peace deal” was announced.</li><li>The prisoner release is a precursor to
      other items such as a political agreement between the Taliban &amp; Afghan
      gov’t.</li><li>Initial withdrawal of 5,000 U.S. soldiers (out of approx.
      13,000) is set in next few months if certain goals are met; <strong>the
      challenges of meeting these goals cannot be
      understated.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider:</h2><ul><li>The Taliban recently
      reportedly promoted photos of their well-equipped, armed “special ops”
      unit. The “Red Unit” has led attacks on Afghan forces.</li><li>Local
      al-Qaeda affiliates shared the photos.</li><li><strong>Why It
      Matters</strong>: As part of the peace deal, the Taliban agreed to cut
      ties with terrorist groups. Taliban attacks on Afghan forces have
      continued.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>The first American soldiers landed in Afghanistan in October 2001.
      Reportedly, Taliban members are being recruited by al-Qaeda, the terrorist
      group behind the 9/11 attacks. In the meantime, 3 American contractors
      were evacuated from Afghanistan this weekend after testing positive for
      COVID-19.</p><p></p></div>
