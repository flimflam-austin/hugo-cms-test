      > “Jules, this is Brian. Listen, I’m on an airplane that’s been hijacked.
      If things don’t go well, and it’s not looking good, I just want you to
      know I absolutely love you. I want you to do good, go have good times –
      same to my parents and everybody … and I’ll see you when you get there.”
