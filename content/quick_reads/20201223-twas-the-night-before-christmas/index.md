      <div><blockquote>“We know not who we are indebted for the following
      description of that unwearied patron of children – that homely but
      delightful personification of parental kindness – Santa Claus…but, from
      whomever it may have come, we give thanks for it.”</blockquote><p>Troy
      Sentinel, the weekly newspaper that published, "ACCOUNT OF A VISIT FROM
      ST. NICHOLAS" on Dec. 23, 1823. At the time, the author remained a
      mystery, and in some ways, still is.</p></div>

      Santa Claus hails from the North Pole, he was actually a New
      Yorker…”</em></strong></p><p>The poem’s author solidified the image of

      <div><p>How did the paper get the poem? Another mystery. The paper wrote
      on that day: "We hope our little patrons, both lads and lasses, will
      accept it as proof of our unfeigned good will toward them—as a token of
      our warmest wish that they may have many a merry
      Christmas."</p><p></p></div>
