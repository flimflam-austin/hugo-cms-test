      <div><h2>2nd Amendment</h2><p>There’s endless debate as to what the 2A
      *actually* means, how it should be applied today, and why it was included
      in the Bill of Rights, but here’s what it says:</p><p><strong><em>“A well
      regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
      right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
      infringed.’</em></strong></p></div>

      repealed. In 1933, the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, which
