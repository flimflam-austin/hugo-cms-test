      > “I’ve lived in North Carolina my entire life, and I’ve seen a lot of bad
      storms, a lot of bad hurricanes. But this is absolutely the worst.”  
        
      David Fountain, Duke Energy's North Carolina operations president, and a
      lifelong NC native on Hurricane Florence's wrath. 300,000 of Duke Energy's
      1.4M impacted customers are still without power. Fountain says Duke is
      "pleased with restoration efforts.... but there's much more to do."

      > "I believe that with this agreement we prevented a humanitarian crisis
      in Idlib.”  
        
        
      Turkey's President Erdogan after a 3-hr long meeting with Russia's
      Vladimir Putin outlining a demilitarized zone for Syria. Idlib is the last
      remaining holdout for Syria's anti-government rebels. U.S. says Syria has
      been prepping a possible chemical attack. It's unclear if Syria's
      President Bashar al-Assad supports Erdogan-Putin plan.

      "It’s impossible to conceive that I could run as a Republican…. That’s not
      to say I’m with the Democratic Party on everything, but I don’t see how
      you could possibly run as a Republican.”  
        
        
      Michael Bloomberg, media executive (76), on running for President in 2020.
      The 3-term NYC Mayor was elected as a Republican & switched to the
      Independent party, but now says only a major party nominee can win. He's
      spending $80M to support Dems in 2018.

      "For months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and
      give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies… But, so far,
      China has been unwilling to change its practices."  
        
      President Trump as the U.S. ups its tariffs on China by 10% on about $200B
      of Chinese goods starting next week. He threatened more tariffs should
      China retaliate, setting up what could be a prolonged trade war between
      the world's two biggest economies.
