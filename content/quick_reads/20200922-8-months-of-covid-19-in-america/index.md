      ## Patient Zero


      * **First Case:** 35-year-old man who returned to U.S. from Wuhan, China.

      * **What To Know:** It wasn’t discussed in detail at the time, but he
      was**really sick**, admitted to the hospital & given supplemental oxygen.

      * Initially referred to as the “Wuhan Coronavirus,” the World Health Org.
      renamed the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 as
      COVID-19:**Co**rona**vi**rus**D**isease 20**19**.

      ## Recent Studies


      * Pregnant women w/COVID may have a higher risk of serious complications.

      * Research shows a racial disparity in the most serious cases of COVID-19
      in young Americans, with Black & Hispanic people overrepresented in
      COVID-related deaths.

      * **Common Thread:** Those with preexisting conditions, such as obesity
      and diabetes, tend to experience the most severe cases.

      ## USA By The Numbers


      * 6.8M confirmed cases.

      * Approx. 200,000 dead.

      * **To date, about one-fourth of U.S. deaths occurred in nursing homes.**

      * One suggestion: Instead of mass “shutdowns,” new research suggests
      “cocooning” those who are most vulnerable, such as the elderly and their
      inner circle of carers, to keep serious cases down and hospital resources
      available.

      ## Something To Consider


      > “Maybe there is more immunity out there.”  
        
      Immunologist Marcus Buggert to the British Medical Journal on whether
      researchers should look at T-cells rather than antibodies to gauge
      someone's immunity to COVID. The journal cites 6 separate studies that
      show 20-50% of participants with no known exposure or infection still have
      a COVID-19 immune response in T-cells.

      In 9 months, we went from never wearing a face mask to likely owning
      several. Two doctors write in the New England Journal of Medicine that
      masks may not necessarily stop infections, but lead to less severe/more
      asymptomatic cases, and THAT might be the benefit of masks for the general
      population. Read it now!
