      <div><h2>Patient Zero</h2><ul><li><strong>First Case:</strong> 35-year-old
      man who returned to U.S. from Wuhan, China.</li><li><strong>What To
      Know:</strong> It wasn’t discussed in detail at the time, but he was
      <strong>really sick</strong>, admitted to the hospital &amp; given
      supplemental oxygen.</li><li>Initially referred to as the “Wuhan
      Coronavirus,” the World Health Org. renamed the disease caused by
      SARS-COV-2 as COVID-19: <strong>Co</strong>rona<strong>vi</strong>rus

      higher risk of serious complications.</li><li>Research shows a racial
      disparity in the most serious cases of COVID-19 in young Americans, with
      Black &amp; Hispanic people overrepresented in COVID-related
      deaths.</li><li><strong>Common Thread:</strong> Those with preexisting
      conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, tend to experience the most

      cases.</li><li>Approx. 200,000 dead.</li><li><strong>To date, about
      one-fourth of U.S. deaths occurred in nursing homes.</strong></li><li>One
      suggestion: Instead of mass “shutdowns,” new research suggests “cocooning”
      those who are most vulnerable, such as the elderly and their inner circle
      of carers, to keep serious cases down and hospital resources
      available.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><blockquote>“Maybe there is more
      immunity out there.”<br><br>Immunologist Marcus Buggert to the British
      Medical Journal on whether researchers should look at T-cells rather than
      antibodies to gauge someone's immunity to COVID. The journal cites 6
      separate studies that show 20-50% of participants with no known exposure
      or infection still have a COVID-19 immune response in
      T-cells.</blockquote></div>

      <div><p>In 9 months, we went from never wearing a face mask to likely
      owning several. Two doctors write in the New England Journal of Medicine
      that masks may not necessarily stop infections, but lead to less
      severe/more asymptomatic cases, and THAT might be the benefit of masks for
      the general population. Read it now!</p><p></p></div>
