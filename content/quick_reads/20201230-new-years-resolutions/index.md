      ## RESOLUTION ORIGINS


      * Believed to date back 4,000 years ago to ancient Babylon, where people
      held a celebration at the start of the new farming year and made pledges
      to the gods for the coming year.

      * Romans also marked the start of a new year; Julius Caesar began
      tradition of “new” year beginning in January.

      * 1671 diary entry by a Scottish writer references “resolutions.”
