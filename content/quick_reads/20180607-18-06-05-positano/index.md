**SmartHER Positano:**

**I thought no exotic destination could ever match our Honeymoon in Bora Boraa|. until we arrived on the Amalfi Coast, and Positano literally took my breath away.**..There was some luck involved with the choice! We wanted romance, amazing foodA and wine, glorious scenery and warm wonderful people. A It was perfect!

My husband and I are really good travel partners – we have the best time together! A (busy life can make you forget this) My parents went away for 2 weeks every year by themselves when I was growing up. I remember thinking it was so romantic. A While we have not been able to manage getaways that frequently, we have gone away every 5 years on big anniversaries and a few other times in between. A **If it comes down to the choice between spending money on stuff or spending time together, invest in your marriage. A That way when you eventually have anA empty nest, you will still haveA each other.**

I have been a working mom for most of my life, in pharma and medical device sales, with most of my career at Johnson & Johnson.A After being at JNJ since 1996, I decided to leave in 2016A because it suddenly hit me that my youngest child had 2 years left at home before college, and I did not want to miss a moment! A My job was very demanding and involved travel, and most importantly constant distraction. As any working mother can attest, I have been SO BUSY for the past 25 years that it”s been a blur! A **I am glad I took aA career break right now, it”s a decision that I will never regret.**

Here are a few of lessons learned on our memorable trip to Positano:

**HINT**  
Under no circumstances should you drive a car between Rome or Naples, and the Amalfi Coast- if you plan on continuing your life! A The narrow road winds around hairpin turns high above the ocean, and hangs on the edge of nothing. My husband can drive anywhere, on the wrong side of the road, in the middle of Paris – but he was very glad that we hired a driver to pick us up in Naples!

**POSITANO**  
With every intention of exploring the entire Amalfi Coast from our home base in Positano, we couldn”t bring ourselves to leave. A Positano climbs up  
a steep seaside cliff in one direction, and tumbles down to the sea in the other. Ancient pastel-colored homes cut into the mountain are connected by hundreds of  
stone staircases, with charming hotels, restaurants and shops at every turn. A Pergolas overhead provide shade covered with beautiful flowers and lush vines, the scent of lemon trees hanging in the air.  
After climbing up and down steps all day, there is no guilt in the evening as you enjoy the best homemade pasta and fresh fish you have ever eaten!

**Peak Tourist Season is June 1-August 30th**  
The ideal months to visit the Amalfi Coast are May and September, when the weather is 60-70 degrees and the area is much less crowded and expensive

**CAPRI**  
Take the Ferry or a private boat over to Capri- a quick 30 minute trip from the beach at Positano.

Ride the Funicular up to Capri- then the bus up to Anacapri- and finally the Mount Solaro Chairlift or hike up to Mount Tiberius, at the very top of the island- you are literally  
on top of the world! A This is where the Emperor Tiberius used to toss people he didn”t like off the cliff into the sea, so it”s much more enjoyable to visit Capri today.

Capri is quaint and charming, with very upscale mini-versions of all the top designer stores and fun restaurants, for a day of shopping and exploring

**Positano is the perfect romantic getaway with your person! A If you go, here are my top recommendations**

* Le Sirenuse Hotel A A https://sirenuse.it/en
* Franco”s Bar A http://francosbar.com/en
* La Sponda Restaurant A https://www.exploretock.com/la-sponda/
* Ristorante Max A http://www.ristorantemax.it/restaurant.html
* Music on the Rocks A http://www.musicontherocks.it
* Pasquale Volpe- amazing Impressionist artist, he can be found most days on the beach painting

_Positano bites deep. A It is a dream place that isn”t quite real when you are there, and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone_

**-John Steinbeck, Harpers Bazaar A May 1953**
