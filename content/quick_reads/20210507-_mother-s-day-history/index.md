      <div><blockquote><strong>The Daughter Behind Mother’s
      Day</strong></blockquote><ul><li>Anna Jarvis wanted to honor her own
      mother, who founded “Mothers' Day Work Clubs” to teach health and
      sanitation to mothers in the Appalachian communities during the
      1860s.</li><li>Jarvis' mother also cared for both Union and Confederate
      soldiers, and formed "Mothers Friendship Day" to encourage reconciliation
      after the Civil War.</li><li>After her mother's death, Jarvis began a
      campaign to honor mothers. She held the first Mother's Day celebration to
      honor her mother (and all mothers) in West Virginia in 1908 and two years
      later the state declared it a holiday. </li></ul></div>

      <p>By the 1920s, mothers nationwide were showered with candy, flowers,
      cards, &amp; other gifts to celebrate Mother’s Day, but Jarvis grew
      frustrated with the commercialization of the holiday, that she intended as
      a day to honor the role mothers play in the family, church, and community.
      She spent the rest of her life fighting against its commercial success
      because she wanted it a "to be a day of sentiment, not profit."  </p>
