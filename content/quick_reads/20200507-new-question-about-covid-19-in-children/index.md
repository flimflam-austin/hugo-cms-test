      <div><h2>The Backstory</h2><p><strong>Monday:</strong> NYC Health Dept.
      issued alert after flagging 15 children with similar symptoms hospitalized
      since mid-April.</p><p><strong>Patients:</strong> Aged 2-15 years old;
      some tested positive for COVID-19 (or antibodies) while others tested
      negative.</p><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Similar to toxic shock and/or
      “Kawasaki disease” (an illness that causes inflammation), persistent
      fever.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We want to reassure parents – this appears to be
      uncommon.”<br><br>Dr. Jane Newburger, Dir of the Kawasaki Program at
      Boston Children’s Hospital, in a statement released by the American Heart
      Association on Wednesday. The group says, though rare, "some children are
      becoming very ill extremely quickly" and list symptoms as "persistent
      fever, inflammation &amp; evidence of single or multi-organ dysfunction"
      and "may or may not test positive for
      COVID-19."</blockquote><p><br></p></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><p>This bulletin from NYC is corroborated by
      reports from doctors in Europe and the U.S, (mainly on the East Coast) and
      notably in areas with high COVID-19 infection rates.</p><p>Health
      officials have been baffled at the low rates of COVID-19 among children —
      this raises questions about a more nuanced, rare response in otherwise
      healthy children.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><p>The number of confirmed COVID-19
      cases among U.S. children remains low. However, children are not
      extensively tested.</p><p>According to the most recent CDC data, about
      21,000 Americans under 18 tested positive for COVID-19, a small percentage
      of the 1M+ cases.</p></div>

      <p>For context - the 2019-2020 flu season was particularly deadly for
      children under the age of 4 (CDC reported 170 deaths), and had
      historically-high hospitalization rates for those under 18 years old.</p>
