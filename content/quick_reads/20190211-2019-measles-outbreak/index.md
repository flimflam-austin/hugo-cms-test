      <blockquote>“Measles can be so contagious that you can be in a room, and
      if you’re susceptible, two hours after someone with measles left, and
      still get the disease.”<br>Dr. Alan Melnick, director of public health for
      Clark County, the site of the measles outbreak in Washington state. Most
      of the cases are children under 10. The vaccination rate for school age
      children is 78%, much lower than recommended 90-95% to create community or
      herd immunity.</blockquote>

      been attributed to various causes, including <strong>refusal to

      <strong>waning immunity</strong>, and <strong>imported
      cases.</strong>“<br><br><br><br>Medical researcher &amp; author CL
