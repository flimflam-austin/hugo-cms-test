      # POISONOUS LEAVES?


      * **Not true**. Poison Control has debunked the often-quoted myth that
      Poinsettias’ sap can be dangerous to small kids & dogs**.**

      * While irritating, a study found a 50-pound child would have to**eat 500
      leaves** for a harmful effect.

      * Researchers say the taste would be awful, but advise**keeping it away
      from pets** because it may cause vomiting & diarrhea.

      # HOW DO YOU SAY IT?


      Poin-set-ah?  

      Poin-set-ee-ah?


      The dictionary says both are technically correct.


      But since it was named after a person, Poinsett, English scholars believe
      the added**“ia” should be pronounced** (Poin-set-ee-ah) & it should always
      be**capitalized**.

      Blooming only once around Christmas, the Poinsettia is America's 2nd most
      popular potted flowering plant, behind orchids. The $200M market includes
      150 kinds, but red is the most popular. One California ranch sells over
      70% of all U.S. Poinsettias. Read more here.
