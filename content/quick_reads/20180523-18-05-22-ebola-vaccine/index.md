      ## Challenges of The Congo


      * **Currently**: Most Ebola cases in a very remote area with “**major
      logistical challenges.**” Vaccine needs transport at perfect temperature –
      and some of the travel “has limited road access.”

      * **The Concern**: Several Ebola cases in a major city of 1M+. Limited #
      of vaccine doses avail.

      ## Why Ebola Is Dangerous


      * **Quick Killer:****Very infectious – Not very contagious**. A small
      amount can make you fatally sick. But it’s actually difficult to spread.
      It’s not airborne, but it is spread through direct contact with bodily
      fluids, exposure to contaminated objects from an infected person, and by
      handling infected meat.

      * Ebola killed** 11,000+ inA Africa in 2014-2016**; 11 cases in U.S.

      U.S. has contributed $8M to the efforts to contain the spread of Ebola in
      Congo - more than any other country. We'll watch for more $$ & updates.
