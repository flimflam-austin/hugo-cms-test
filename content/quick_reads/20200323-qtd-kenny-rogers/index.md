      > _“When I was young, my mom gave me one of the greatest pieces of advice
      I’ve ever gotten….She said, ‘Son, be happy where you are. Never be content
      to be there but if you’re not happy where you are, you’ll never be happy.’
      And so at the low points of my career, I had to stop and think that this
      is all I ever wanted to do is make music anyway.”_

      Kenny Rogers passed away Saturday. The son of a carpenter and a part-time
      cleaning lady sold 100 million+ records. The Grammy winner also won 19
      American Music Awards - that’s more than any other artists with the
      exception of Taylor Swift, Michael Jackson, Alabama & Whitney Houston.
