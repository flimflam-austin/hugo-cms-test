      ## THE WAGE DEBATE


      The American economy has grown, added jobs & workers… but data shows
      our**income is NOT rising as quickly, as expected, as previous years, or
      compared to what things cost (inflation)**.


      Do we look like we make more on paper, but have less $pending power?

      ## What’s Going on?


      No one knows for sure: 2 theories


      **White House:**A Bad data & wage growth is good. Stats don’t consider tax
      cuts & other perks. Some (non-WH) economists agree.


      **Another theory:**A People reentering workforce may get lower paying or
      part-time jobs, or have fewer qualifications, so they make less $$.

      Something To Consider: The way the census measures median income has
      changed. Some say that makes the data difficult to compare to previous
      years. It's a good reminder data tells us only so much of a story. How do
      you feel about your wages and the economy?

* **The Economics and Emotions Behind Slow Wage Growth**

We should also admit the possibility that there is no problem to solve, no mystery to explain — that wages are growing in line with the economy”s overall performance. Moody”s Analytics economist Adam OzimekA findsA that when you measure slack using the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate, wages are growing at a pace you would expect.Or consider a simpler calculation: Roughly speaking, wages grow if workers are more productive and if overall prices are increasing. Productivity growth has been lower this cycle than in the past, and based on its performance wage growth is only slightly slower than you”d expect.These are compelling arguments, but I”m not sold. Wage growth is slower than we”d expect, and the reason is something of a mystery. Some combination of all the factors we”ve discussed is probably the culprit. This is good news, because it means that a healthy rate of wage growth is likely in the future. But let”s hope the future arrives sooner rather than later.
