      ## BIG PICTURE


      * Iran: long considered an adversary of the U.S. and its interests.

      * The U.S. designated Iran a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984; this
      designation has remained through Republican & Democratic administrations.

      * In addition to other sanctions, this designation restricts foreign aid
      and enables policies against those supporting or facilitating acts of
      terror.

      ## What’s Happening


      * Iran announced a clear move towards developing nuclear weapons**last
      week** despite a 2015 multinational “nuclear deal” that limited their
      program. European nations remain in the deal; the U.S. withdrew in 2018.

      * Iran seized a South Korean oil tanker**last week**, holding approx. 20
      sailors. Iran accuses South Korea of holding its funds “hostage;” South
      Korea froze Iran’s assets as part of U.S. sanctions.

      ## Timing Matters


      * Iran’s nuclear announcement comes a year after America targeted and
      killed a high-profile Iranian general.

      * Dec. 20: Iranian-backed militia attacked the U.S. embassy in
      Baghdad:_“While this 21 rocket attack caused no U.S. injuries or
      casualties, the attack did damage buildings in the U.S. Embassy compound,
      and was clearly NOT intended to avoid casualties.” U.S. CentCom_

      Acting Sec. of Defense Chris Miller, Jan. 3, 2021 - announcing the
      American aircraft carrier USS Nimitz will "halt" its return home only days
      after announcing the end of the ship's nearly 10-month deployment, citing
      "recent threats issued by Iranian leaders.” The Associated Press reported
      the U.S. recently deployed B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to “caution"
      the Iranian regime against potential attacks.

_“We should not fool ourselves,” the 97-year-old diplomat, consultant and author said. “I don’t believe that the spirit [of the Iran deal], with a time limit and so many escape clauses, will do anything other than bring nuclear weapons all over the Middle East and therefore create a situation of latent tension that sooner or later will break out.”_  
_The current leaders in Iran “don’t seem to find it possible to give up this combination of Islamist imperialism and threat,” Kissinger said. “The test case is the evolution of nuclear capacities in Iran, if these can be avoided.”_  
_“I do not say we shouldn’t talk to them,” he added._  
_Dennis Ross, a former adviser to presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, interviewed Kissinger at the JPPI farewell event for its founding director, Avinoam Bar-Yosef._

What's disturbing is that the same man has the UNCHECKED authority to start a nuclear war; a security concern for the entire int'l community.
