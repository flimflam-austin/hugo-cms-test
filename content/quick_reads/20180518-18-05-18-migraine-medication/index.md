* **SmartHER Tip:** What’s the difference between a super bad headache and a migraine?  
While both bring discomfort, migraines cause disabling pain that can last several days.  
Migraine sufferers may experience nausea or even vomiting, heightened sensitivity to bright lights, vision loss or even food cravings – These symptoms can come in 4 stages. You can read about the stages here:A **Mayo Clinic:**A [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201)
