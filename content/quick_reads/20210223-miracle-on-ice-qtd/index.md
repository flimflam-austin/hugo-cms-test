      <p>Head coach Herb Brooks inspired the amateur U.S. Olympic hockey team
      before one of the greatest upsets in sports history, defeating the Soviet
      Union 4-3 on Feb. 22, 1980. "The Miracle on Ice" came during a tumultuous
      time - the Cold War, U.S. hostages held in Iran, long gas lines &amp;
      rising crime. The U.S. team went on to win the gold medal.</p>
