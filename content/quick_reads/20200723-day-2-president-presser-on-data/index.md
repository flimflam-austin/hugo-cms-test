      > “Nationwide, beyond the outbreak in several states, cases remain low and
      very stable.”  
        
      Pres. Trump says the percentage of Americans testing positive for COVID-19
      is declining and lower than in the spring. Meanwhile, California surpassed
      New York Wednesday as the state having had the most cases of COVID-19 in
      the nation (413,000+). Ohio, Minnesota & Indiana issued statewide mask
      mandates; the Pres. said a decision about mask requirements on federal
      property is coming in the next 24 hours.

      > “…we’re requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in
      states where you had the worst outbreaks.”


      Pres. Trump said the federal government would distribute 15,000 rapid
      tests to nursing homes, calling the 5-15 minute tests "very accurate."
      *Separately,* The New England Journal of Medicine this week highlighted
      Congress allocating $1.5B for rapid, point-of-care COVID-19 testing with
      the hopes of being able to test 2% of the U.S. population, or 6 million
      people per day, by this fall.

      > “Our strategy is to shelter the highest-risk Americans, while allowing
      younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being
      careful and very vigilant. “


      Pres. Trump repeated that more than half U.S. COVID deaths are attributed
      to a group that makes up less than 1% of the U.S. population: those in
      nursing homes or long-term care facilities. The President said he is
      "comfortable" letting his child/grandchildren go back to school.

  - order: 4
    body: >-
      The President said the U.S. gov't is looking carefully at how children
      transmit COVID-19 and to expect more information "over the next week." The
      President said the gov't secured doses of a potential vaccine, is focusing
      on therapeutics, and he remains hopeful for a "cure."

**New England Journal of Medicine on rapid testing:** Rapid Scaling Up of Covid-19 Diagnostic Testing in the United States — The NIH RADx Initiative

_On April 24, 2020, Congress appropriated $1.5 billion, from the $25 billion provided in the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act for SARS-CoV-2 testing, to the NIH. Within 5 days after the legislation was signed into law, the NIH launched RADx to support the development, production scale-up, and deployment of accurate, rapid tests across the country. From a timing perspective, the RADx initiative was conceived by Congress to provide near-term solutions to increase the number of tests available by the fall of 2020, as schools and universities evaluate the safety of in-person classes and as the annual influenza season begins. In the slightly longer term, RADx also aims to support the development and production of innovative diagnostic technologies as well as strategies for making testing available to diverse, vulnerable, and underserved populations through 2021. One of the goals of the RADx initiative is to expand capacity so that by December 2020, approximately 2% of the U.S. population (6 million persons) can be tested per day, with more tests ready for rapid deployment in proportion to national demand._
