      ## How You Clean


      * The CDC says calls to Poison Control related to the **use of cleaners
      and disinfectants (specifically bleach and hand sanitizer)** have
      increased.

      * Concerns increased across **all age groups** with the largest increase
      related to **inhalation**.

      * Examples of ER trips? Woman had difficulty breathing after mixing bleach
      with vinegar in her kitchen sink. Child ate hand sanitizer left on the
      counter.

      ## What You Eat


      New information from the FDA: Whether it’s the food you eat via take-out
      or food you buy in the store wrapped in its own packaging, the FDA says
      there’s **no current evidence of either** being associated with
      transmission of COVID-19.


      Recommendation: The FDA says wiping down products is an “extra precaution”
      you can take “if you wish.”

      ## Drinking “Quarantinis”


      Alcohol sales have increased during the pandemic. Nationwide, sales
      increased in liquor stores and groceries 22% during the last week of
      March.


      A World Health Organization advisory last week cautioned to limit alcohol
      because of its negative impact on mental health and the immune system.

      The World Health Organization's regional European office also "encourages
      governments to enforce measures which limit alcohol consumption" during
      this pandemic. Do you think that's a good idea? One Florida liquor store
      owner in argued: "Alcohol lessens the immune system but it boosts morale."
