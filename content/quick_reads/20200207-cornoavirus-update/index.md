      by being in close proximity with someone who is ill, like the
      measles.</li><li>Right now, the CDC believes the new coronavirus is spread
      via droplet; touching infected surfaces, or having someone sneeze/cough
      near you from 3-6 ft may spread the disease.</li></ul><p></p></div>

      Use a paper towel to turn off the faucet and open the door. Use your elbow
      to touch an elevator button and try not to touch high-traffic surfaces…All
      those things that help protect us from the flu, will also help protect us
      from the coronavirus.”<br><br>Dr. Darria Long Gillespie, MD MBA, author of

      flu since October, and 180,000 were hospitalized (comparable to past

      available to doctors &amp; will provide results in 4 hrs.</p><p></p></div>

* **CDC’s Advice:**
  * _Stay informed – CDC is updating its website daily with the latest information and advice for the public._
  * _Remember to take everyday preventive actions that are always recommended to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses._
      * _Avoid close contact with sick people._
    * _While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible._
    * _Stay home if you are sick._
    * _Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way._
    * _Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs._
    * _Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% alcohol._
  * _If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China or were in close contact with someone with 2019-nCoV in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms._
