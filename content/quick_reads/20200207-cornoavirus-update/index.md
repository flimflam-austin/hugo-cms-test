      weeks are diverted to 11 airports where they are screened, and if
      necessary quarantined.

      ## DO YOU NEED A MASK?


      > “There really is no need to wear a mask right now…Exactly what you do to
      protect against influenza, applies to protecting against coronavirus – and
      that does not include wearing a mask.”

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Majority of respiratory illnesses spread either through tiny**airborne**
      germs or**droplets**.

      * Airborne germs can easily spread simply by being in close proximity with
      someone who is ill, like the measles.

      * Right now, the CDC believes the new coronavirus is spread via droplet;
      touching infected surfaces, or having someone sneeze/cough near you from
      3-6 ft may spread the disease.

      ## Practical Advice


      > “Wash your hands really well. Use a paper towel to turn off the faucet
      and open the door. Use your elbow to touch an elevator button and try not
      to touch high-traffic surfaces…All those things that help protect us from
      the flu, will also help protect us from the coronavirus.”

      For context: the CDC estimates 10,000 people have died from the flu since
      October, and 180,000 were hospitalized (comparable to past years). The CDC
      just announced coronavirus diagnostic test kits are now available to
      doctors & will provide results in 4 hrs.

* **CDC’s Advice:**
  * _Stay informed – CDC is updating its website daily with the latest information and advice for the public._
  * _Remember to take everyday preventive actions that are always recommended to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses._
      * _Avoid close contact with sick people._
    * _While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible._
    * _Stay home if you are sick._
    * _Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way._
    * _Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs._
    * _Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% alcohol._
  * _If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China or were in close contact with someone with 2019-nCoV in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms._
