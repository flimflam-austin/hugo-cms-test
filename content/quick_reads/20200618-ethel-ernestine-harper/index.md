      Harper was the final woman to take on the role of “Aunt Jemima” for
      promotional appearances.


      * Born in Alabama, Harper became an orphan at the age of 9 and graduated
      from college at 17.

      * She became a teacher before moving to NYC, appearing on Broadway.

      * She later became a leader in her NJ community, volunteering and
      reportedly becoming the first black history teacher in the county.

      Quaker Oats announced Wednesday it will remove the name & image of Aunt
      Jemima from its products: "We recognize Aunt Jemima's origins are based on
      a racial stereotype." The Aunt Jemima brand has existed for 130 years.
      Uncle Ben's & Land o' Lakes also announced changes to their branding for
      similar reasons.
