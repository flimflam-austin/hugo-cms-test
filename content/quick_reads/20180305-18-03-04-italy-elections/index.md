      Italy Elects New Gov’t  

      Why It Matters


      * Italy: European Union (EU) founding member country; symbolic & economic
      importance.

      * First election in 5 years – will determine gov’t for next 5 years.

      * No clear winner, but Euroskeptic, anti-establishment parties gained most
      votes, & ruling center-left party lost ground.**This marks a change.**

      # No Clear Winner?


      * **5-Star movement & Center Right Coalition** win most votes.

      * Any party or coalition needs more than 40% support to win enough seats
      to govern.**None did.**

      * Meant to encourage coalition building, but may end in a “hung
      Parliament.”

      * Experts say 2017 changes to Italy’s election laws make it harder for one
      single party to win.
