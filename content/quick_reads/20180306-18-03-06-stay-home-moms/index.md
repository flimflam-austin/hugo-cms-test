      & have reduced job opportunities when attempting to regain employment.A
      When fathers opt out…they too face penalties, and in some contexts greater
      penalties than opt out mothers.”

      ## Study Shows Vicious Cycle


      * Stay-at-home parents are seen as less reliable & dependable thanA others
      because they are perceived as caring about family more than work.

      * An all-encompassing work life forces many parents out of traditional
      roles. It’s those same ‘expectations’ that keep them from re-entering the
      workforce.
