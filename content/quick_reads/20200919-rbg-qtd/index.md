      <div><p>Called the court's "feminist icon," Justice Ginsberg began her law
      career fighting for gender equality, and in 1993 became the 2nd woman on
      the Supreme Court (there's been 4 of 114). Her mother, who passed away
      before she graduated from high school, inspired her education and drive.
      Justice Ginsberg died at age 87.</p><p></p></div>

A few highlights from the Wall Street Journal:

* **_“The genius of this Constitution is that, over the course of now more than two centuries, ‘We the people’ has become more and more inclusive,”_** _she said in a 2014 interview with The Wall Street Journal. “So it includes people whose ancestors were held in human bondage. It includes Native Americans, who were not part of ‘We the people,’” when the charter was ratified, she added._ _“And, at last in 1920, half the population, women,” were brought within the polity through the 19th Amendment, she said._ [_CLICK HERE_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies-11600472623)
* _Like other justices, Justice Ginsburg grew an extended family through the law clerks she selected. When former clerks had children, she typically sent them infant sized T-shirts welcoming her new “grandclerk.”_
* _“…she was one of nine women in a class of about 500.”_
* _Justice Ginsburg is survived by a daughter, Jane Ginsburg, a law professor at Columbia, and a son, James, a music producer in Chicago._
