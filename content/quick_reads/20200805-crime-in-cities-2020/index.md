      <div><h1>How Safe Are You?</h1><h2>Depends on the
      statistic.</h2><blockquote>As the federal government expands law
      enforcement into major U.S. cities, here’s what one report says about
      violent crime in America in 2020.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>Backstory: The Data Gap</h2><ul><li>Crime statistics are
      <strong>voluntarily</strong> reported by localities to the federal
      government.</li><li>Cities may report crimes differently (or not at all)
      and at different times.</li><li>Lawmakers from both parties proposed
      legislation to encourage or mandate more comprehensive crime-reporting in
      the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in police custody. Legislation has
      stalled.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>What To Know</h2><p>The Dept. of Justice recently launched
      “<strong>Operation Legend</strong>” – sending resources, equipment &amp;
      federal law enforcement to fight crime alongside local police. Some mayors
      don’t want the help.</p><p>In light of the difference in opinions and
      varying data, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> did an independent analysis
      of violent crime statistics in the largest 50 U.S. cities.</p></div>

      <div><h2>What The Data Says:</h2><ul><li>Overall: Homicides, shootings up
      in top cities in 2020. Other violent crimes (such as robbery, rape) are
      down.</li><li>Homicides up across regions.</li><li>1 in 8 homicides in
      America happening in the city of Chicago.</li></ul><p><strong>Important
      Context:</strong> Homicides increased but are not currently at historic
      levels. In other words: it’s not good, but it’s been worse.</p></div>

      <div><p>“Everything that society does that might shape public safety was
      turned upside-down during the pandemic.”<br><br>Director of the University
      of Chicago's "Crime Lab" Jens Ludwig, on the WSJ data. Anecdotes point to
      different reasons for the rise in homicides -- from recession, pressure on
      police in connection with the pandemic and protests, &amp; gangs gaining
      strength because of the closures of schools, churches and after-school
      programs.</p><blockquote><br></blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><p>U.S. cities have become increasingly safer
      over the last few decades. Here’s 3 questions we’re asking:</p><ul><li>Is
      a rise in homicides reflecting a moment in time, or the beginning of a
      trend of an increase in crime overall?</li><li>What are the impacts of the
      pandemic and protests on local police?</li><li>What role does politics
      play in all of this, especially during an election
      year?</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>"Operation Legend" was named after a 4-year-old boy, LeGend,
      killed during a shooting in Kansas City, MO. It expanded last week from
      Kansas City, Chicago, &amp; Albuquerque to include Detroit, Cleveland,
      &amp; Milwaukee -- putting the Trump administration at odds with local
      lawmakers. Read more:</p><p></p></div>
