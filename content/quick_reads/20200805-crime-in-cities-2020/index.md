      # How Safe Are You?


      ## Depends on the statistic.

      ## Backstory: The Data Gap


      * Crime statistics are**voluntarily** reported by localities to the
      federal government.

      * Cities may report crimes differently (or not at all) and at different
      times.

      * Lawmakers from both parties proposed legislation to encourage or mandate
      more comprehensive crime-reporting in the aftermath of George Floyd’s
      death in police custody. Legislation has stalled.

      ## What To Know


      The Dept. of Justice recently launched “**Operation Legend**” – sending
      resources, equipment & federal law enforcement to fight crime alongside
      local police. Some mayors don’t want the help.


      In light of the difference in opinions and varying data,_The Wall Street
      Journal_ did an independent analysis of violent crime statistics in the
      largest 50 U.S. cities.

      ## What The Data Says:


      * Overall: Homicides, shootings up in top cities in 2020. Other violent
      crimes (such as robbery, rape) are down.

      * Homicides up across regions.

      * 1 in 8 homicides in America happening in the city of Chicago.


      **Important Context:** Homicides increased but are not currently at
      historic levels. In other words: it’s not good, but it’s been worse.

      “Everything that society does that might shape public safety was turned
      upside-down during the pandemic.”  
        
      Director of the University of Chicago's "Crime Lab" Jens Ludwig, on the
      WSJ data. Anecdotes point to different reasons for the rise in homicides
      -- from recession, pressure on police in connection with the pandemic and
      protests, & gangs gaining strength because of the closures of schools,
      churches and after-school programs.

      ## Why It Matters:


      U.S. cities have become increasingly safer over the last few decades.
      Here’s 3 questions we’re asking:


      * Is a rise in homicides reflecting a moment in time, or the beginning of
      a trend of an increase in crime overall?

      * What are the impacts of the pandemic and protests on local police?

      * What role does politics play in all of this, especially during an
      election year?

      "Operation Legend" was named after a 4-year-old boy, LeGend, killed during
      a shooting in Kansas City, MO. It expanded last week from Kansas City,
      Chicago, & Albuquerque to include Detroit, Cleveland, & Milwaukee --
      putting the Trump administration at odds with local lawmakers. Read more:
