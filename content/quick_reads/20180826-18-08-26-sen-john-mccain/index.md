      <div><p>In his newly released memoir, The Restless Wave, he wrote: It’s
      been quite a ride. I’ve known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought
      in a war, and helped make a peace. I made a small place for myself in the
      story of America and the history of my times.’</p><p><a
