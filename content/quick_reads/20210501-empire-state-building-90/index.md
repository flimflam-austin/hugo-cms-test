      close to earth like a beast, the spirit of man soars to higher regions,

      enterprises.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Helen Keller in a 1932 letter writing about
      her visit to the Empire State Building. Both blind and deaf, Keller came
      to this description based on feeling alone - a tribute to the symbolism
      and size of the building.</p></div>

      <p>The Empire State Building is one of America's most well-known
      attractions. Standing at 1,250 feet tall, it was originally designed to be
      a docking station for airships. Due to the city's wind currents and
      surrounding buildings, it was instead built to be one of the largest
      office buildings in the world.</p>
