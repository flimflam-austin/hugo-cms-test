      > “…the day is coming when telegraph wires will be laid on to houses just
      like water and gas — and friends converse with each other without leaving
      home.”  
        
      Alexander Graham Bell wrote this in a letter to his father on the day of
      his first successful telephone test when "articulate speech was
      transmitted." Like his father, Bell taught school for the hearing
      impaired; his mother & wife were both deaf. His knowledge of speech and
      sound are said to have helped inspire his invention.
