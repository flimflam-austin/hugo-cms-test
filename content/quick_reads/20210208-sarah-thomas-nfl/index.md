    body: "The first woman (and mother!)\_to officiate a Super Bowl, Sarah Thomas became a \"permanent\" NFL official in 2015. This is her response to how to deal w/angry coaches or players - Stay professional and ignore when required. Thomas said if she ever had the opportunity to officiate a Super Bowl she'd want to earn it as a reflection of being top of the game."
