      ballot, and <strong>BEFORE</strong> the Electoral College votes, there’s
      another critical part of the electoral process in a presidential

      <div><h2>BACKGROUND</h2><ul><li><strong>Before Election Day:</strong> Each
      state’s political parties nominate electors (Electoral College
      members).</li><li><strong>Election Day:</strong> When you vote, you’re
      actually voting for a slate of electors who pledge to vote for the
      candidate of the party who nominated them.</li><li><strong>After Election
      Day:</strong> States use popular vote results to appoint
      electors.</li><li><strong>December 14th:</strong> The 538 appointed
      electors vote – majority (270) wins.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The “Safe Harbor” Deadline</h2><ul><li>States have several weeks
      to confirm and certify federal election results.</li><li>During this time,
      the state government, campaigns, or citizens can take action — such as
      auditing results, presenting legal challenges, requesting
      recounts.</li><li>States must finalize results &amp; name voting electors
      (chosen by the winning party) 6 days before the Electoral College votes in
      order for the results to be deemed “conclusive.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><blockquote><em>“Losing the safe harbor
      protection leaves Congress to decide which electors to count from a state,
      without mandatory deference to the preferences of either the state’s
      voters or legislature.”</em><br><br>National Task Force on Election Crises
      explaining the stakes of meeting "safe harbor" requirements 6 days before
      the Electoral College votes. The federal "safe harbor" law dates back to
      1887.</blockquote><p><br></p></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider:</h2><ul><li>Some call the 1887 Electoral
      Count Act a “<em>morass of ambiguity</em>.”</li><li>The law requires
      electors to vote 41 days after an election (this year, it’s Dec. 14th,
      which means electors have to be appointed by Dec. 8th for “safe harbor”
      protections).</li><li>If disputed results in the states still exist, the
      new Congress can play a role in resolving those contests. This has never
      happened in modern history.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Congress played a role in deciding a presidential election in 1876
      - which led to the creation of the "safe harbor" law for states. Legal
      scholars interpret electoral law differently, which is why you might see
      several scenarios if states can't confirm results by Dec. 8. We'll humbly
      wait and see what happens next.</p><p></p></div>
