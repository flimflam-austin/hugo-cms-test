      ## BACKGROUND


      * **Before Election Day:** Each state’s political parties nominate
      electors (Electoral College members).

      * **Election Day:** When you vote, you’re actually voting for a slate of
      electors who pledge to vote for the candidate of the party who nominated
      them.

      * **After Election Day:** States use popular vote results to appoint
      electors.

      * **December 14th:** The 538 appointed electors vote – majority (270)
      wins.

      ## The “Safe Harbor” Deadline


      * States have several weeks to confirm and certify federal election
      results.

      * During this time, the state government, campaigns, or citizens can take
      action — such as auditing results, presenting legal challenges, requesting
      recounts.

      * States must finalize results & name voting electors (chosen by the
      winning party) 6 days before the Electoral College votes in order for the
      results to be deemed “conclusive.”

      ## Why It Matters:


      > _“Losing the safe harbor protection leaves Congress to decide which
      electors to count from a state, without mandatory deference to the
      preferences of either the state’s voters or legislature.”_  
        
      National Task Force on Election Crises explaining the stakes of meeting
      "safe harbor" requirements 6 days before the Electoral College votes. The
      federal "safe harbor" law dates back to 1887.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * Some call the 1887 Electoral Count Act a “_morass of ambiguity_.”

      * The law requires electors to vote 41 days after an election (this year,
      it’s Dec. 14th, which means electors have to be appointed by Dec. 8th for
      “safe harbor” protections).

      * If disputed results in the states still exist, the new Congress can play
      a role in resolving those contests. This has never happened in modern
      history.

      Congress played a role in deciding a presidential election in 1876 - which
      led to the creation of the "safe harbor" law for states. Legal scholars
      interpret electoral law differently, which is why you might see several
      scenarios if states can't confirm results by Dec. 8. We'll humbly wait and
      see what happens next.
