      <div><p>Whoever "wins the White House" this year will follow a tradition
      of every U.S, president since Pres. John Adams, the first inhabitant, in
      1800 - a full 8 years after construction began. Adams wrote the line on
      the front of our card stack in a letter to his wife Abigail a day after
      moving in.</p><p></p></div>
