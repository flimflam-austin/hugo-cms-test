      the first outbreak.


      **~ just over 4 months later ~**


      **May 30**: 1.7M+ confirmed cases.

      ## BASICS


      > “…pandemic continues to be severe.”


      * While**your risk of exposure differs on your specific community**,
      nationwide incidents of COVID-19 is 403 cases per 100,000 people.

      * Women and men have roughly equal incidents of COVID-19.

      * However, men are more likely to have “severe outcomes” – i.e. higher
      rates of hospitalizations and death.

      hospitalizations** and**12x more likely to die** than those without
      pre-existing conditions.


      The most common pre-existing conditions:**heart disease**,**diabetes**
      and**chronic lung disease**.

      ## AGE


      **Median age: 48 years**


      ***NEW DATA***: Incidents of COVID-19 HIGHER among 40-59 year-olds (and
      specifically among 50-59-year-olds) than those 60-79 years old.


      **Overall**: Highest incidents among those older than 80 and lowest in
      children younger than 9.

      ## Symptoms / No Symptoms


      Most common symptoms: 70% reported fever, cough or shortness of breath.


      * Those with no symptoms of COVID-19 = 4% of cases.

      * The CDC theorizes one of the reasons why those under 19 have
      dramatically lower known rates of infection may be because of unreported,
      “undiagnosed milder or asymptomatic illnesses.”

      Pre-existing conditions remain a major factor for serious cases of
      COVID-19. Data continues to show Hispanic and Black Americans are
      disproportionately affected by the new coronavirus. Limits on data (less
      than half of all cases included info on race, fewer on health conditions)
      inhibit CDC's explanation as to why.
