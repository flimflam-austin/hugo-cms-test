      fever, cough or shortness of breath.</p><ul><li>Those with no symptoms of
      COVID-19 = 4% of cases.</li><li>The CDC theorizes one of the reasons why
      those under 19 have dramatically lower known rates of infection may be

      <div><p>Pre-existing conditions remain a major factor for serious cases of
      COVID-19. Data continues to show Hispanic and Black Americans are
      disproportionately affected by the new coronavirus. Limits on data (less
      than half of all cases included info on race, fewer on health conditions)
      inhibit CDC's explanation as to why.</p><p></p></div>
