      Dollars & Sense


      The Supreme Court ruled states can require online sellers to collect sales
      tax on your purchases – what this means for your family.

      ## What Happened?


      Some online retailers voluntarily collect sales tax in the 45 states + DC
      that impose a sales tax,**but many don’t**, placing brick-and-mortar shops
      at a disadvantage.


      The high court overturned a 1992 ruling prohibiting states from collecting
      sales tax from out-of-state retailers w/o a ‘physical presence’ in the
      same state as the buyer.

      > “The retail industry is changing, and the Supreme Court has acted
      correctly in recognizing that it’s time for outdated sales tax policies to
      change as well. This ruling clears the way for a fair and level playing
      field where all retailers compete under the same sales tax rules whether
      they sell merchandise online, in-store or both."

      ## What It Means For You:


      * **Online-only shops might raise their prices to make up for the money
      they’ll have to pay in sales tax to the states.A** Amazon is unlikely to
      do so – it’s been collecting sales tax nationwide on most items since
      2017.

      * **States will have more $ to spend internally.** In its decision, the
      Supreme Court estimated states were losing up to $33B a year.

      Stocks for major online retailers like Amazon, Ebay, Overstock and Wayfair
      all dropped immediately following the ruling, but the lasting impact will
      take some time to measure.
