      <div><blockquote>“As a pediatrician who has practiced medicine for over
      three decades, I find this number staggering and
      tragic.”</blockquote><p>American Academy of Pediatrics President Sally
      Goza, M.D., FAAP, on the more than 1 million cases among children. She
      also notes that while severe illness among children with COVID-19 is rare,
      the secondary effects -- such as school disruptions and family stress --
      also weigh heavily on children during the pandemic.</p></div>

      <div><p>Based on what we know so far, most children experience milder
      symptoms of COVID-19 than adults, and some who test positive may not have
      any symptoms at all but still can spread illness. While some argue schools
      risk higher infection rates, others say school rules help keep families
      safe. What do you think?</p><p></p></div>
