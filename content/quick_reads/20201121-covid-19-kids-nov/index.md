      ## More Context


      * The data comes from 49 states & D.C., but states differed in the type of
      data reported (ex: cases vs. hospitalizations vs. deaths) AND definition
      of “child” (ex: 0 – 14 yrs, 0 – 20 yrs).

      * The **hospitalization rate among children was 1.6%** based on the 23
      states and NYC providing hospitalization data.

      * Of the 42 states providing fatality data, **children made up less than
      1% of deaths**.

      > “As a pediatrician who has practiced medicine for over three decades, I
      find this number staggering and tragic.”


      American Academy of Pediatrics President Sally Goza, M.D., FAAP, on the
      more than 1 million cases among children. She also notes that while severe
      illness among children with COVID-19 is rare, the secondary effects --
      such as school disruptions and family stress -- also weigh heavily on
      children during the pandemic.

      Based on what we know so far, most children experience milder symptoms of
      COVID-19 than adults, and some who test positive may not have any symptoms
      at all but still can spread illness. While some argue schools risk higher
      infection rates, others say school rules help keep families safe. What do
      you think?
