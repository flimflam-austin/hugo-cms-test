      ## Runoff Elections 101


      * In most states, the candidate with the majority of votes is declared the
      winner.

      * In the 10 states where runoff elections are mandated, runoffs are
      triggered when no candidate receives a certain percentage of the vote.
      Percentage thresholds vary by state.

      * In GA, a candidate must receive over 50% of the vote to win. If not, the
      two candidates with the most votes *automatically* face-off in a runoff.

    body: "## Why These Races Matter\n\n* The outcomes will determine which party controls the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate 50 to 48.\n* Democrats need both Ossoff *and* Warnock to win to get to a 50-50 split.\n* **REMEMBER:** Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\n* **FYI:**\_**No GA Democrat has won a U.S. Senate race since 2000.**"

      While past precedent favors Republicans winning GA runoff elections,
      Pres-elect Biden became the first Democrat since 1992 to win the state as
      a presidential candidate (by approx. 12,000 votes). Voter participation in
      GA's runoff races is historic, with early voting surpassing past records;
      results expected in several days.
