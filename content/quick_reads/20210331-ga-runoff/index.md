      <div><p>While past precedent favors Republicans winning GA runoff
      elections, Pres-elect Biden became the first Democrat since 1992 to win
      the state as a presidential candidate (by approx. 12,000 votes). Voter
      participation in GA's runoff races is historic, with early voting
      surpassing past records; results expected in several
      days.</p><p></p></div>
