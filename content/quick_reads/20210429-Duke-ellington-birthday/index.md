      <p>On this day in 1899, Edward "Duke" Ellington, a founding father of
      jazz, was born in Washington D.C. For nearly his entire legendary career
      of over 50 years, he led a jazz orchestra originally<strong>
      </strong>based out of Harlem (NYC) that became world famous. Pres. Nixon
      awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969. Fun fact:
      Ellington's friends nicknamed him "Duke" as a kid because of his manners
      and suave, cool demeanor. </p>
