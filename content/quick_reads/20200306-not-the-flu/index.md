      > For weeks, you’ve heard a comparison between the new coronavirus and the
      flu.  
        
      The World Health Organization now says that comparison doesn’t work.

      “This virus is not SARS. It is not MERS. And it’s not influenza. It is a
      unique virus with unique characteristics.”


      Director-General of the World Health Organization Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus,
      who listed four ways COVID-19 is different than the seasonal flu.

      ## TRANSMISSION


      * COVID-19 does not spread as easily as the flu, according to data
      collected *so far.*

      * The World Health Organization says asymptomatic people often spread the
      flu. For COVID-19, that does not yet *appear* to be the case.

      * Context: Widespread studies looking for COVID-19 among otherwise-healthy
      people will either prove or disprove this theory.

      ## VACCINES & TREATMENT


      * No vaccines or therapeutic drugs exist for the new coronavirus.

      * The CDC: Flu vaccines “reduce the risk” of influenza by about 50%;
      vaccinations & exposure help build immunity to the flu that you don’t have
      to COVID-19.

      * Anti-virals (like Tamiflu) can help lessen flu symptoms but none are
      available so far for COVID-19.

      * WHO: 20 COVID-19 vaccines in development.

      ## CONTAINMENT


      > “We don’t even talk about containment for seasonal flu. It’s just not
      possible. But it’s possible for COVID-19.”  
        
      Dr. Tedros, Director-General of the World Health Organization.

      ## This Year’s Flu in America


      * Est. 32 million Americans got the flu.

      * Est. 300,000 hospitalizations.

      * Est. 18,000 deaths.

      * 125 pediatric deaths (children 0-4 years-old): highest rate in the same
      time period since 2009 swine flu pandemic; highest hospitalization rates
      for children in the same period since the CDC began reporting 2004-2005.

      While the WHO says comparisons between flu and COVID-19 don't work well,
      systems set up to track the flu may be helpful to collect necessary
      research on the spread of COVID-19. One caveat? Data for the flu, even for
      different strains, has been collected for decades; We only have about 90
      days of COVID-19 data.
