      ## What Research Says:


      * Divorce rates within the first five years of marriage **dramatically
      decrease** if you marry between the ages of 25 – 35…but **increase if you
      marry** **younger OR older**.

      * Higher success rates of marriage for couple committed (not necessarily
      married) AFTER age 23-years-old; 60% divorce rate before 23 vs approx. 30%
      divorce rate after.

* **A CDC Report Shows Just How Common Living Together Is Cohabitation has changed a lot about relationships and family formation.A Scott M. Stanley Ph.D.**_Cohabitation has greatly increased in large measure because, while people are delaying marriage to ever greater ages, they are not delaying sex, living together, or childbearing. In fact, on the latter point, Manning noted in her recent address to the Population Association of America that almost all of theA increase in non-marital births in the U.S.A since 1980 has taken place in the context of cohabiting unions.**Cohabiting with more than one partner outside of marriage has also gone steadily higher.[v] The NCHS report does not demonstrate the trend, but the data reported do show that 44% of the currently-cohabiting group and 20% of the neither cohabiting nor married group has already lived withA two or more partners. Ever higher levels of serial cohabitation mean that more people are on one of the pathways strongly associated with risks for family instability or divorce.[vi]**Prior research has shown that serial cohabitation is strongly associated with economic disadvantage among unmarried couples,[vii] lower odds of marriage, and increased odds of poor marital outcomes, but serial cohabitation is growing rapidly among different population groups.[viii]__Increasing rates of cohabitation as well as serial cohabitation might be of no special consequence except for the point noted above, that many births now occur in cohabiting unions. Some percentage of these couples have a long-term commitment similar to marriage, but, on average, cohabitingA parentsA are much more likely than married parents to break up,[ix] resulting in increasing odds of family instability for children_.A [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sliding-vs-deciding/201807/cdc-report-shows-just-how-common-living-together-is](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sliding-vs-deciding/201807/cdc-report-shows-just-how-common-living-together-is)
