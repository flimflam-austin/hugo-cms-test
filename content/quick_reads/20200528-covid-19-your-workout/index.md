      ## KEEP IN MIND


      * CDC: COVID-19 spreads “mainly” **person-to-person** via respiratory
      droplets released when someone talks, sneezes, or coughs.

      * CDC: Questions remain about how effectively the virus spreads on
      surfaces. Hard, non-porous materials – like metal – in high traffic areas
      pose a risk for transmission (ex. touching an infected handle on an
      exercise bike and then wiping sweat from your eyes).

      ## The Latest Science


      * New study on COVID-19 spread among fitness class attendees in **South
      Korea.**

      * 27 instructors attended a February 15 workshop before returning to 12
      different gyms; unknowingly 8 instructors were infected w/ COVID-19.

      * In the following weeks, **57 of the 217** class attendees developed
      COVID-19.

      * Additionally, 38 **family members** and 17 **co-workers / friends**
      developed COVID-19. **Total infections: 112.**

      > “Because of the increased possibility of infection through droplets,
      vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be avoided during the
      current outbreak, as should public gatherings, even in small groups.”


      The study's authors hypothesized high-intensity workout classes held in
      small spaces with moist, warm air and many participants can lead to
      COVID-19 transmission. They noted infected instructors *appear* to not
      have spread the virus in yoga or pilates classes.

      ## THE LATEST: USA


      * **Gyms** are open in 25+ states under new rules requiring precautions
      like social distancing, masks & reduced capacities.

      * Ohio: judge ruled state’s health dept “_criminalized lawful businesses_”
      by closing gyms & health clubs, allowing them to reopen as long as they
      comply w/ safety requirements.

      * Maine: delayed reopening of gyms after seeing the new study out of South
      Korea highlighted by CDC.

      Unlike other industries (ex: schools, restaurants, places of worship), the
      CDC has not issued specific reopening guidance for gyms. Check out the
      CDC's guidance for other industries on our source page.
