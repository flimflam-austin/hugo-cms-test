      <div><h2>KEEP IN MIND</h2><ul><li>CDC: COVID-19 spreads “mainly”
      <strong>person-to-person</strong> via respiratory droplets released when
      someone talks, sneezes, or coughs.</li><li>CDC: Questions remain about how
      effectively the virus spreads on surfaces. Hard, non-porous materials –
      like metal – in high traffic areas pose a risk for transmission (ex.
      touching an infected handle on an exercise bike and then wiping sweat from
      your eyes).</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      fitness class attendees in <strong>South Korea.</strong></li><li>27
      instructors attended a February 15 workshop before returning to 12
      different gyms; unknowingly 8 instructors were infected w/
      COVID-19.</li><li>In the following weeks, <strong>57 of the 217</strong>
      class attendees developed COVID-19.</li><li>Additionally, 38
      <strong>family members</strong> and 17 <strong>co-workers /
      friends</strong> developed COVID-19. <strong>Total infections:
      112.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Because of the increased possibility of infection
      through droplets, vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be
      avoided during the current outbreak, as should public gatherings, even in
      small groups.”</blockquote><p>The study's authors hypothesized
      high-intensity workout classes held in small spaces with moist, warm air
      and many participants can lead to COVID-19 transmission. They noted
      infected instructors *appear* to not have spread the virus in yoga or
      pilates classes.</p></div>
