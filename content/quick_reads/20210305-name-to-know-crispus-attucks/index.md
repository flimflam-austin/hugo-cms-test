      ## Crispus Attucks


      * African-American sailor believed to have escaped slavery 20 years prior.

      * The first of five men to die as a result of the Boston Massacre;
      reportedly killed instantly when outnumbered British soldiers fired
      suddenly into a crowd of dozens of angry colonists (protesting British
      taxes, restrictions, overall rule).

      * Attucks was championed as the first martyr for the cause of American
      liberty.

      ## Why It Matters:


      6 years before the Declaration of Independence, the Boston Massacre
      created greater momentum for colonists who desired freedom from Great
      Britain.


      Those killed on March 5, 1770 were promoted by the “Sons of Liberty” as
      martyrs for the cause of freedom; Attucks’ name was the only one to become
      widely-known.

      Lawyer & future U.S. Pres. John Adams' defense of British soldiers led to
      their acquittal in an American court... an irony since the "Boston
      Massacre," by its name & story, unified colonists vs. the British & sowed
      the seeds of the American Revolution.
