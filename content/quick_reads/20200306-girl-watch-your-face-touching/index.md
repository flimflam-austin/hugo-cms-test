      of Health (NIH) observed 249 people in the Washington D.C. subway and in a
      city in Brazil to measure how often we touch a “common item” (like a
      railing or subway pole) and then touch our mouth or
      nose.</p><p><strong>Findings:</strong> People touched their faces on
      average 3.3 – 3.6 times per hour in public where the possibility of

      <div><p>“We therefore suggest a <strong>shift</strong> in the focus of the
      recommendations issued during outbreaks toward ensuring that individuals
      understand how self-inoculation occurs and <strong>thus avoid touching
      their faces</strong>… Although built on the influenza pandemic experience,
      this suggestion should be <strong>equally relevant for other respiratory
      pathogens that can be the source of severe outbreaks</strong>.”</p><p>Dr.

      <div><p>Researchers suggest reminding people to wash their hands to
      prevent illness is good, but telling them to stop touching their faces may
      actually be BETTER during times of respiratory epidemics.</p><p></p></div>
