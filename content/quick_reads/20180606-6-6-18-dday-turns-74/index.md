      ## Why It Matters


      * **Largest naval, air & land operation in history.**

      * D-Day allowed the allies (U.S., England, New Zealand, Poland, Australia,
      etc.) to gain strategic position in Europe vs. Hitler’s Germany.

      * Est. 6,603 Americans died June 6, 1944 (for context: this is more than
      the total number of Americans killed in the entire Iraq War).

      # “Well, is it or isn’t it the invasion?”


      ## Adolf Hitler


      On the day of the invasion, Hitler slept until noon. His staff was too
      scared to tell him of the attack.


      D-Day signifies the beginning of the end for Hitler.

* **June 6, 1944 73rd anniversary of D-Day**:_A_ [https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/june_6_1944_73rd_anniversary_o.html](https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/june_6_1944_73rd_anniversary_o.html)

_What does the “D” in D-Day stand for? U.S. Commander Gen. David Eisenhower later clarified its meaning, writing in 1964 that “any amphibious operation has a departed date; therefore, the shortened term D-Day is used.”_

_That’s why military historians will tell you the Normandy invasion was just one of several D-Days of World War II. Every amphibious assault – including those in the Pacific, North Africa, Sicily and Italy- had its own D-Day, the Army said._
