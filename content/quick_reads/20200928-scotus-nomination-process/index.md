      What’s Next?


      > Navigating the nomination process for the next potential Supreme Court
      Justice.

      The Constitution says the President “_shall nominate, and by and with the
      Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint … Judges of the Supreme
      Court…_”


      The Constitution's Appointments Clause is silent about when nominations
      should be made for the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) and
      says nothing about timing of SCOTUS nominations during election years, NOR
      qualities of a nominee - they don't even have to have a legal degree.

      ## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS


      * Senate receives Pres’s nomination.

      * Senate Judiciary Committee authorizes investigation & holds public
      hearings

      * Cmte. votes whether to recommend nominee to full Senate. If votes in
      favor, nomination goes to full Senate.

      * Full Senate debates the nominee.

      * 51 votes needed to stop debate and move to the vote.

      * 51 votes required to confirm the nominee.

      ## THE MATH


      A simple majority will approve the nominee, clearing the path to the
      court.


      The Republicans control the Senate by a **53-47** margin.


      Republicans can **lose up to 3 votes** and the nominee could still be
      confirmed because Vice President Mike Pence gets the tie-breaking vote in
      a 50-50 scenario.

      ## BIG PICTURE


      * Historically, **most nominees (77%) are confirmed** regardless of the
      party of the President or majority in the Senate (not all are confirmed by
      a large majority).

      * In recent years, the nomination process has taken **approx. 70 days**.

      * If we look at the confirmation process for sitting Justices, we see a
      **range in timelines**: Chief Justice Roberts was confirmed in 23 days.
      Justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed in 99 days.

      While many look to Election Day as a deadline for the nominee's approval,
      the current Senate can vote anytime before the next Congress takes office
      on January 3, 2021. That said, this is "the closest high court opening to
      a presidential election in more than 150 years," according to The
      Washington Post.
