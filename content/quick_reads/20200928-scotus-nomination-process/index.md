      during election years, NOR qualities of a nominee - they don't even have

      are confirmed</strong> regardless of the party of the President or
      majority in the Senate (not all are confirmed by a large
      majority).</li><li>In recent years, the nomination process has taken
      <strong>approx. 70 days</strong>.</li><li>If we look at the confirmation
      process for sitting Justices, we see a <strong>range in
      timelines</strong>: Chief Justice Roberts was confirmed in 23 days.
      Justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed in 99 days.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>While many look to Election Day as a deadline for the nominee's
      approval, the current Senate can vote anytime before the next Congress
      takes office on January 3, 2021. That said, this is "the closest high
      court opening to a presidential election in more than 150 years,"
      according to The Washington Post.</p><p></p></div>
