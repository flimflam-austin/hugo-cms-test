      <div><h2>Facebook Drama</h2><ul><li>Remember <strong>FB</strong> owns
      <strong>Instagram</strong> (and other HUGE social network companies like
      <strong>WhatsApp</strong>). This is why the security “fumble” is so
      significant.</li><li><strong>Your user experience on FB or Insta may
      change.</strong>A For example, accounts where you “like” a photo so you
      can shop the product have likely been altered until a full security
      assessment is completed.</li></ul></div>

* An Update on Our Plans to Restrict Data Access on Facebook: [https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/)
* _Still, given the public”s lack of understanding of APIs and platforms, it may be tough for Facebook to ever regain the trust broken by a month of savage headlines about the social network”s privacy negligence.
