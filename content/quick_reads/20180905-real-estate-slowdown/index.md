      # REALTY CHECK


      Foreclosures – while still historically low – are rising in**nearly half
      of U.S. housing markets.** Is it the latest sign of a broader real estate
      slowdown?

      ## What To Know:


      > ‘The increase in foreclosure starts is**not just a one-month anomaly**
      in many local markets given that July represented the third consecutive
      month with a year-over-year increase in 33 metro areas, including Los
      Angeles, Miami, Houston, Detroit, San Diego and Austin.”

      ## Why it Matters


      The Great Recession was triggered largely by the U.S. housing bubble
      bursting in 2007 after years of lenders giving out risky mortgages.


      Our current lending environment has changed, but one property data company
      says “some loosening” of lending standards has put risk back into the
      market.

      ## Cause For Concern?


      * **High Home Prices:** Median cost of U.S. homes was up 6.2% in June vs.
      last year – a lower gain from the previous month.

      * **Rising Mortgage Rates:** 30-year fixed 4.5% vs. 4% at start of 2018.

      * **Homebuilding Slows:A** hit a 9-month low in July and has yet to
      significantly rebound.

      * **Fewer Foreign Buyers:** Overseas purchases down a record 21%.
