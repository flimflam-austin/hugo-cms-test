      <div><p>On this day in 1929, Audrey Hepburn was born in Belgium. She
      studied ballet from a young age while growing up in the Netherlands during
      World War II, before shifting her focus to acting. Both a humanitarian and
      fashion icon, she is best known for roles in films including "Breakfast at
      Tiffany's," "Roman Holiday," and "My Fair Lady." Hepburn spent her later
      years working as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, a charity dedicated to
      serving children living in poverty around the world. </p><p></p></div>
