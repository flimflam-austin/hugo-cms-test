      <div><h2>July 2, 1776</h2><ul><li>The Second Continental Congress
      (delegates from the 13 colonies) met in Philadelphia and voted to
      <strong>approve</strong> the resolution for independence on July 2, 1776,
      declaring freedom from Great Britain. John Hancock later signed
      first.</li><li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> John Adams made it clear he
      thought July 2 should be the celebratory day, writing in a July 3, 1776
      letter that it will become “the most memorable” day in America’s
      history.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>August 2, 1776</h2><ul><li>The Declaration (dated July 4) did not
      became <strong>official</strong> until it was signed by most of the the
      Second Continental Congress on August 2, 1776.</li><li><strong>Why It
      Matters:</strong> In addition to proclaiming that “<em>all men are created
      equal</em>” endowed with rights including “<em>Life, Liberty and the
      pursuit of Happiness</em>,” the Declaration allowed the 13 colonies to
      secure assistance from <strong>France</strong> in the Revolutionary
      War.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>September 3, 1783</h2><ul><li>Although 4th of July festivities
      are recorded dating back to 1777, and other nations acknowledged America’s
      independence, Great Britain did not officially recognize our independence
      until a September 3, 1783 treaty.</li><li><strong>Big Picture:</strong>
      Even after the Declaration of Independence was signed, colonists continued
      to fight for 7+ years for Great Britain to acknowledge their
      autonomy.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>DID YOU KNOW? Although July 4th has long been one of America's
      most-celebrated secular holidays, it's only been a federal holiday for 150
      years. President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill into law establishing the
      first federal holidays - including New Year’s Day, Independence Day, and
      Christmas Day - on June 28, 1870.</p><p></p></div>
