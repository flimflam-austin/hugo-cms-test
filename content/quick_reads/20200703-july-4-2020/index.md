      ## July 2, 1776


      * The Second Continental Congress (delegates from the 13 colonies) met in
      Philadelphia and voted to**approve** the resolution for independence on
      July 2, 1776, declaring freedom from Great Britain. John Hancock later
      signed first.

      * **Fun Fact:** John Adams made it clear he thought July 2 should be the
      celebratory day, writing in a July 3, 1776 letter that it will become “the
      most memorable” day in America’s history.

      ## August 2, 1776


      * The Declaration (dated July 4) did not became**official** until it was
      signed by most of the the Second Continental Congress on August 2, 1776.

      * **Why It Matters:** In addition to proclaiming that “_all men are
      created equal_” endowed with rights including “_Life, Liberty and the
      pursuit of Happiness_,” the Declaration allowed the 13 colonies to secure
      assistance from**France** in the Revolutionary War.

      ## September 3, 1783


      * Although 4th of July festivities are recorded dating back to 1777, and
      other nations acknowledged America’s independence, Great Britain did not
      officially recognize our independence until a September 3, 1783 treaty.

      * **Big Picture:** Even after the Declaration of Independence was signed,
      colonists continued to fight for 7+ years for Great Britain to acknowledge
      their autonomy.

      DID YOU KNOW? Although July 4th has long been one of America's
      most-celebrated secular holidays, it's only been a federal holiday for 150
      years. President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill into law establishing the
      first federal holidays - including New Year’s Day, Independence Day, and
      Christmas Day - on June 28, 1870.
