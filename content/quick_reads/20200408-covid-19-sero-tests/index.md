      U.S. gov’t reports how many people have been tested, how many test
      positive or negative, and total deaths.</p><p>We don’t know how many
      people have COVID-19 but have minor or no symptoms
      (asymptomatic).</p><p><strong>Bottom Line: We have an incomplete picture
      of COVID-19 in America.</strong></p></div>

      <div><h2>Why Sero Tests Matter</h2><blockquote>“We can test people to see
      if they’ve been exposed, immune, and go back to work. And a combination of
      that kind of test with the current kind of tests we have now is how
      America opens back up again.”<br><br>Admiral Girior MD, Assistant
      Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
      (HHS) during a COVID-19 Task Force briefing.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>Sero Tests 101</h2><p>Serological (aka “sero”) tests or surveys
      are blood tests that measure specific antibodies produced by your immune
      system in response to an infection.</p><p>The antibody is evidence that a
      person has been exposed to an infection (<strong>whether or not they ever
      showed symptoms</strong>) – and *may* have immunity.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“…someone who’s recovered from the virus and doesn’t have
      the virus in their system at all, you can take plasma…that plasma contains
      the proteins in the blood that have the antibodies against the virus. You
      can take that, process it, and then give it to someone who’s ill. And so
      that allows you to transfer that immunity.”</blockquote><p>FDA
      Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn on a potential treatment for COVID-19 -
      another reason why sero tests matter.</p></div>

      about the reliability of sero tests currently on the market.</p><p>Dr.
      Birx warned Americans against purchasing sero tests on the
      internet.</p><p>Admiral Girior referenced a report that the UK purchased
      millions of tests that may not work.</p></div>

      <div><p>The FDA granted emergency use authorization to one serological
      test. Results are available within 15 to 20 min. On Monday, Adm. Giroir
      M.D. said he expects to have millions of antibody tests available by May,
      but he wants to ensure the tests are accurate before widespread
      use.</p><p></p></div>
