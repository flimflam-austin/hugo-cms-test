      respiratory tract: your lung. The whole goal of the vaccine is that when
      this coronavirus comes through your nose, your mouth, into your lung – to
      prevent it from hitting the target that will infect you. You just want to
      block it.”<br><br>U.S. Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci who
      leads the Nat'l Institute of Allergy &amp; Infectious Diseases. Best case,
      accelerated scenario: it will take at least a year to develop a

      COVID-19. Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with
      COVID-19, we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical
      outcomes. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for
      determining if an experimental treatment can benefit
      patients.”<br><br>NIAID Director and U.S. Coronavirus Task Force member
