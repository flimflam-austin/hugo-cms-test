      ## What Happened?


      * The War of 1812: Great Britain vs. U.S. – it lasted nearly 3 years
      (longer than U.S. involvement in WWI).

      * Caused by disputes over trade, clashes between the Royal Navy & U.S. sea
      merchants, AND the whole pesky U.S. fight for independence years earlier.

      * **1814 Burning of the Capitol & White House:** In retaliation for the
      U.S. burning the capital of Upper Canada, British forces burned gov’t
      structures in D.C.

      lawmakers (and the general public) by_“**combining government, learning,
      and librarianship.”**_

      * **1815:** After the fire, the House voted to buy Thomas Jefferson’s
      personal library of 6,487 books for $23,950 – the largest collection of
      books in the U.S. at the time.

      The smallest book in the Library of Congress is about the size of a period
      at the end of this sentence; the largest book is 5' by 7'. The Library's
      rare books collection also holds treasures such as one of the earliest
      mass-produced books - a 15th-century Gutenburg Bible.
