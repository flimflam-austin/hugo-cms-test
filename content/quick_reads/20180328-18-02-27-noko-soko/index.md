      Kim Jong Un:  

      Why Travel To China Now?


      * China remains North Korea’s ONE major ally. Arguably, without China,
      North Koreans would starve and freeze.

      * Kim has meetings planned with SoKo President Moon Jae-in & President
      Trump in coming weeks.

      * Show of unity as reports surface of a major trade pact between South

      ## U.S. & SoKo Trade Deal


      * SoKo to allow 25,000 more U.S. car imports – a 50% increase.

      * U.S. to exempt South Korea from certain proposed steel tariffs, but will
      *still* restrict steel imports.

      * **Bottom Line: Both countries walk away with a ‘win.’**

      * P.S. Show of force not just economic. Joint annual military drills begin
      on Easter Sunday, April 1st.

      Reminder: Approx 25,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Interesting
      Fact: This maybe Kim Jong Un’s first foreign trip after taking power in
      2011, but he actually attended school in Switzerland.

* Long read, but worth it when you have time:A THEA EDUCATIONA OF KIM JONGa\u0013UNA [https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-education-of-kim-jong-un/](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-education-of-kim-jong-un/)A _During the 1990s famine, in which as many as 2a\u00133 million North Koreans died as a result of starvation and hunger-related illnesses, Kim was in Switzerland. His childhood was marked by luxury and leisure: vast estates with horses, swimming pools, bowling alleys, summers at the family”s private resort, luxury vehicles adapted so that he could drive when he was 7 years old. For Kim, skiing in the Swiss Alps and swimming in the French Riviera must have seemed part of his birthright. Kim had a temper, hated to lose, and loved Hollywood movies and basketball player MichaelA Jordan._  
___Fujimoto, the sushi chef, has described Jong-un”s mother as not very strict about education and says that he was never forced to study. His friend and classmate in Switzerland said of Kim: We weren”t the dimmest kids in the class but neither were we the cleverest. We were always in the second tier a| The teachers would see him struggling ashamedly and then move on. They left him in peace. Jong-un was apparently unbothered by his less-than stellar scores; as his classmate noted, He left without getting any exam results at all. He was much more interested in football and basketball thanA lessons._
