      > “The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan
      to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.”


      The President's physician, Dr. Sean Conley, who says he will continue to
      update the American public. The President and First Lady tested positive
      after a busy week of the first presidential debate and travel. COVID-19
      symptoms typically develop anytime from 2-14 days after first exposure.

      ## Context:


      * The President is 74 years old.

      * Conditions highlighted in the President’s recent annual physical exams
      include heart disease, elevated blood pressure and obesity.

      * His age & conditions put him at higher risk for a severe case of
      COVID-19.

      * Context: While a person’s risk increases with age and pre-existing
      conditions, the majority of people in all age groups recover from
      COVID-19.

      ## Statistically Speaking


      COVID-19 data evolves constantly but here’s some perspective on age from
      the CDC:


      A person over the age of 65 is at least:


      * **5x likely to be hospitalized** than a person under 29

      * **90x more likely to die** than a person under 29

      ## When A President Falls Ill…


      The Constitution provides some guidance on what happens if a president
      falls seriously ill for a prolonged period, but …


      * **In general, while a President can fulfill his role, he will continue
      to do so.**

      * Presidents have handed over power temporarily even when not ill, i.e.
      when undergoing procedures that require anesthesia, like a colonoscopy.

      ## If A President Can No Longer Serve…


      A President can transfer power, or it can be “taken” if they’re unable /
      unwilling to “pass it.” Here’s the **order of succession**:


      * Vice President (VP Mike Pence)

      * House Speaker (Rep. Nancy Pelosi)

      * Senate president pro tempore – “president for a time” – traditionally
      the longest-serving Senator of the majority party (Sen. Chuck Grassley,
      R-IA)

      Pres. Trump isn't the first president to fall ill during a pandemic.
      During the last major global pandemic, Pres. Woodrow Wilson contracted
      Spanish flu in 1919. He continued serving, even holding peace talks during
      his illness. Months later he suffered a stroke, but remained in office
      until the end of his term in 1921.
