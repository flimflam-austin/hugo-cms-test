      guidance on what happens if a president falls seriously ill for a
      prolonged period, but …</p><ul><li><strong>In general, while a President

      Pence)</li><li>House Speaker (Rep. Nancy Pelosi)</li><li>Senate president

      <div><p>Pres. Trump isn't the first president to fall ill during a
      pandemic. During the last major global pandemic, Pres. Woodrow Wilson
      contracted Spanish flu in 1919. He continued serving, even holding peace
      talks during his illness. Months later he suffered a stroke, but remained
      in office until the end of his term in 1921.</p><p></p></div>
