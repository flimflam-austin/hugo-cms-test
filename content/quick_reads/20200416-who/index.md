      Pres. Trump accused the WHO of mismanaging the COVID-19 crisis by being
      too differential to China where the virus emerged. He said his
      administration will stop America’s funding of the WHO pending an
      investigation.


      **Something To Note:** Congress allocates taxpayer money. It’s a legal
      debate whether the President can *permanently or unilaterally* halt
      funding.

      “WHO’s role is to provide rational & science-based recommendations to
      countries. But at the end of the day, a sovereign country has the autonomy
      to do what it thinks is right, and based on the situation.”


      WHO Dir. General, Dr. Tedros, on Jan 20. The WHO praised China for its
      "cooperation and transparency," cautioning the outbreak was "evolving." On

      step away and cease funding because we’re worried about WHO being unduly
      influenced by Chinese funding and Chinese influence, by stepping away
      we’re only ensuring that China will have more influence.”

      A new report from the Associated Press suggests China withheld critical
      information about the severity of COVID-19 as it gained speed. China's
      Foreign Minister said that "allegations of a cover-up or lack of
      transparency in China are groundless."
