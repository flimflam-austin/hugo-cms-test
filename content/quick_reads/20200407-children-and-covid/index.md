      ## CHILDREN & COVID-19


      The CDC’s new report reveals what we know (and what we don’t) about how
      the new coronavirus impacts our children.

    body: "## The Basics\n\nPreliminary analysis by the CDC covers COVID-19 data for a roughly 6-week period from mid-February to April.\n\nOut of nearly 150,000 cases, **less than 2%**\_children or teens under 18 years old (2,572 patients).\n\nThree children with COVID-19 died. Investigation still ongoing to confirm COVID-19 as the specific cause of death."

      ## The Data To Note


      Median age of children: 11 years old. Most were exposed by a family member
      of community spread, rather than travel.


      * 15-17 years old: 32% of cases

      * 10-14 years old: 27% of cases

      * 5-9 years old: 15% of cases

      * 1-4 years old: 11% of cases

      * Under 1 year old: 15% of cases

      ## Why It Matters


      **Why It Matters:** While children remain a lower percentage of known
      COVID-19 cases in America, **children are not immune to severe illness**.


      **Notable:** CDC clearly states their data is incomplete – e.g. at times
      knowing a patient’s age but missing basic information, such as “disease
      symptoms, severity, or underlying conditions.”

      > “If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk.”


      The CDC continues to advise against playdates and children visiting with
      anyone outside their immediate household. While a child's symptoms may be
      less severe or even nonexistent, that doesn't mean they can't spread the
      virus. How contagious is a child with little or no symptoms? We still
      don't know.

      The very first case of a child contracting COVID-19 was reported to the
      CDC on March 2. Since then, the CDC says pediatric cases have been
      reported every day.
