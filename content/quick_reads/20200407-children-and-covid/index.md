      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> While
      children remain a lower percentage of known COVID-19 cases in America,
      <strong>children are not immune to severe
      illness</strong>.</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> CDC clearly states their
      data is incomplete – e.g. at times knowing a patient’s age but missing
      basic information, such as “disease symptoms, severity, or underlying
      conditions.”</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at
      risk.”</blockquote><p>The CDC continues to advise against playdates and
      children visiting with anyone outside their immediate household. While a
      child's symptoms may be less severe or even nonexistent, that doesn't mean
      they can't spread the virus. How contagious is a child with little or no
      symptoms? We still don't know.</p></div>

      to the CDC on March 2. Since then, the CDC says pediatric cases have been
      reported every day.</p><p></p></div>
