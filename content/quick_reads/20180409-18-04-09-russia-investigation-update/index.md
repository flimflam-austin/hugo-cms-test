      ## BOTTOM LINE:


      * As guilty pleas pile up, Mueller’s team has secured cooperation
      agreements with some former members of Trump’s team.

      * None of the charges against those connected to Trump allege that they
      worked with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election.

      * Mueller wants to interview Trump.

      * The investigation is **ongoing** and changes day to day.

      After the latest sanctions against Russia were announced on Friday, White
      House Press Sec. Sarah Sanders told reporters: as the President has said,
      he wants to have a good relationship with Russia, but that’s going to
      depend on some of the actions by the Russians.
