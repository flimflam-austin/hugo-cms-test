      The Senate confirmed Pres. Biden's choice for Secretary of the Interior -
      Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve in this role AND in the
      Cabinet. The Dept. of the Interior manages one out of every five acres in
      America. Haaland previously made history as one of the first Native
      American women elected to Congress, where she developed a reputation for
      bipartisanship.

_In a somewhat unusual maneuver, Haaland also touted the support of Rep. Don Young, another Alaska Republican, who introduced her to the committee._

_“I have had her reach across the aisle to talk to me about Alaska. She’s bipartisan,” Young told lawmakers. (CNBC)_
