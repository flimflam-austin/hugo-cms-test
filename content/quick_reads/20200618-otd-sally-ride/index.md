      > ‘I wasn’t really scared. I was very excited, and I was very anxious.
      When you’re getting ready to launch into space, you’re sitting on a big
      explosion waiting to happen.”  
        
      Sally Ride on her journey into space (and the history books) 37 years ago:
      "The stars don't look bigger, but they do look brighter."

      > “When I was a little girl, I dreamed of flying in space. Amazingly
      enough, and I still can’t believe it, that dream came true. And through
      hard work and a good education, all of you will reach for the stars and
      that dream will come true for you.”
