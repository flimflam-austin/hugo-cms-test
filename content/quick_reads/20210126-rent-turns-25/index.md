      > _“525,600 minutes – how do you measure, measure a year? In daylights, in
      sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee. In inches, in miles, in
      laughter, in strife. In 525,600 minutes – how do you measure a year in the
      life? How about love? …Seasons of love.”_

      Larson wrote these lyrics for the famous Broadway play "Rent"- a retelling
      of the opera "La Boheme" - in NYC during the HIV epidemic. Larson, 35,
      died from an aortic aneurysm the day of the play's first public
      performance, 25 years ago today. Rent went on to earn international
      acclaim, a Pulitzer Prize & a Tony Award.
