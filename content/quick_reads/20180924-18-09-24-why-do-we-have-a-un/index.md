      # HOMECOMING…


      ## at The United Nations


      Once a year, 193 nations meet under one roof, where each country has one
      seat & one vote, for one big face-to-face “dance”.


      Why the UN General Assembly matters (and why it doesn’t).


      BTW You Pay For It...

      “WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED  

      to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our
      lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and  

      to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights…”  
        
        
      The UN's founding Charter signed in 1945. Pres. Roosevelt believed an
      international body would help prevent future world wars; Congress agreed &
      approved America's membership.

      ## General Assembly: General Debate


      * Tuesday: One huge meeting where every leader gets to speak.

      * Brazil gave first speech in 1947 & that tradition continues. USA, the
      host country, speaks second.

      * In reality, very little substantial decisions happen during this time,
      BUT it allows for informal conversations between leaders that can have a
      lasting impact.

      ## What To Watch For:


      * **Pres. Trump’s speech on Tues.** In the last year, the U.S. arranged a
      historic summit w/North Korea & withdrew from Iran Nuclear Deal.

      * S. Korea will reportedly deliver a **secret msg**. to U.S. from NoKo: a
      condition of nuclear disarmament.

      * Pres. Trump will chair UN Security Council meeting Wednesday. Topic of
      discussion? Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * America pays for 20% of the UN’s total budget. Last year: **$1.2B**

      * We pay more because of a formula in the UN charter tied to country size
      and wealth.

      * Critics say the UN doesn’t achieve its goal aimed at bringing world
      peace and actually works against America’s interests; Gallup poll =
      majority of Americans agree the UN is not helping solve problems.
