      ## Defamation Suits


      Two of the lawsuits were filed by parents of **Sandy Hook** victims who
      say they suffered threats & emotional distress due to Jones’ conspiracy
      theory about the **2012 school shooting being a hoax**.


      Jones since recanted, but says his words are protected because he is a
      **commentator** offering his **opinion**.

      # Defamation Law


      Plaintiff argues their reputation was harmed by defendant’s false
      statement about them.


      * False statement & those made “with reckless disregard of the truth” =
      defamatory

      * True statement =A non-defamatory

      * **Opinion statement** = non-defamatory IF it can be proven false

      # Why This Matters Beyond Jones:


      New technology is like the Wild West.


      Anyone can reach millions.


      The law hasn’t caught up to new communities or new voices made possible by
      this technology. How the law will evolve in this new era is still a
      question.

      Facebook, YouTube, Apple & Spotify recently removed some of Jones' content
      from their platforms for violating hate speech or bullying policies.
      Twitter did not. Why all the platforms decided to take action now, when
      Jones has posted for years, is unclear.
