* **Trump Greets 3 American Detainees From North Korea (From early May):**  
[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-korea-detainees-pompeo.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-korea-detainees-pompeo.html)
* **Fascinating Read: Tough Talk: US Envoys on how to negotiate with North Korea:**  
[https://apnews.com/75404d2a25ef40f69eb8a57d3b248f6e/Tough-talk:-US-envoys-on-how-to-negotiate-with-North-Korea](https://apnews.com/75404d2a25ef40f69eb8a57d3b248f6e/Tough-talk:-US-envoys-on-how-to-negotiate-with-North-Korea)  
_Gallucci, then an assistant secretary of state, recalled that the Americans were taken aback by the sight of a dozen or so North Korean diplomats, each one with a lapel pin with a picture of their supreme leader.**You can imagine us going into a meeting with lapel pins with Bill Clinton”s picture? It”s just implausible. But that actually goes to something that”s quite important for people to understand, said Gallucci, describing North Korea as a cult of leadership as much as it is an authoritarian government.**_  
_And one forgets that at one”s peril. I think you can lose a lot of ground in discussion if you don”t understand how sensitive they are about their leadership._  
___“To the Americans” surprise, North Korea”s deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok Ju, during the talks quoted from the epic American civil war novel, Gone with the Wind. It wasn”t the line immortalized by Clark Gable in the Hollywood movie — Frankly, my dear, I don”t give a damn, Gallucci said, but rather something to do with wagons rolling and dogs barking. After the meeting, he gave Kang a copy of the book as a gift. Gallucci got a box of Korean ginseng tea in return._
