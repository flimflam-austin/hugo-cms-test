      <div><h2>Why Historic?</h2><h6><strong>Timing</strong>: The U.S.
      Constitution does not specify a day or time a president must speak to
      Congress. However, most modern presidents deliver an address shortly after
      their inauguration in lieu of an official State of the Union address.
      President Biden waited longer than most in recent history - appearing on
      the eve of his first 100 days in
      office.</h6><h6><strong>Unprecedented</strong>: First time in American
      history the president stood with two women behind him - Speaker of the
      House Pelosi (D-CA) and Vice President Harris - to deliver an
      address.</h6></div>

      <div><blockquote>"...we also need to make a once-in-a-generation
      investment in our families and our children."</blockquote><p>Pres. Biden
      announced the American Families Plan in his address, a
      "once-in-a-generation investment" plan with several major pillars: family
      support such as free childcare &amp; up to 12 weeks of paid family (and
      medical) leave, an expanded child/dependent tax credit, and four
      additional years of public education (two free years of preschool for 3-
      and 4-year-olds and two years of free community college).</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>"For me, when I think about climate change, I think
      jobs."</blockquote><p>President Biden mentioned the word 'jobs" more than
      40 times in his address. The president discussed what he described as the
      "largest jobs plan since World War II," a proposal he introduced in late
      March. "The American Jobs Plan" includes investment in infrastructure,
      public transportation and green energy. The American Families Plan and the
      American Jobs Plan both need legislation (passed by Congress) to move from
      a proposal to a reality.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>"I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it
      means to have a son serving in a warzone."</blockquote><p>While the
      president noted America's drawdown in Afghanistan, he also spoke of the
      continued threat of terrorism in places like Yemen and Syria, and the
      importance of "allies" when confronting Iran and North Korea (both
      designated as state sponsors of terror by the U.S. State Dept., although
      the president did not use that title). BTW - the last U.S. president to
      have a child serve in combat was President Eisenhower.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>"He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant,
      consequential nation in the world."</blockquote><p>President Biden
      squarely called out China's President Xi by name midway through his
      speech. These comments were not in prepared remarks, and Pres. Biden went
      on to say that autocrats like Xi believe democracy can't compete in modern
      times. Later in the speech Pres. Biden again discussed Xi, reaffirming the
      Biden admin will "defend America's interests across the board" and
      maintain a "strong military presence" in the region.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>"We need to work together to find a
      consensus."</blockquote><p>The president specifically asked for a police
      reform bill by May 25 (the one-year mark since George Floyd's death.
      President Biden asked the American public to "root out systemic racism
      that plagues America." Separately, the president also discussed
      immigration reform, imploring lawmakers to "end our exhausting war over
      immigration" by passing his proposed legislation - which he says addresses
      a "secure border" as well as a "pathway to citizenship."</p></div>
