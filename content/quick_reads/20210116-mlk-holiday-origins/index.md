      <div><h2>How Did It Gain Support?</h2><ul><li>1979: Pres. Carter publicly
      pledged support; Coretta Scott King, MLK’s widow, began lobbying Congress
      for the holiday – but the first vote failed.</li><li>1983: Momentum
      gathered. Hundreds of thousands gathered in D.C. to mark 20 yrs since the

      <div><blockquote>“Dr. King’s was truly a prophetic voice that reached out
      over the chasms of hostility, prejudice, ignorance, and fear to touch the
      conscience of America. He challenged us to make real the promise of
      America as a land of freedom, equality, opportunity, and
      brotherhood.”</blockquote><p>Pres. Ronald Reagan on January 18, 1986, on
      observing the first MLK holiday - three years after Congress approved the
      holiday bill.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><p><strong>Martin Luther King Jr. and George
      Washington are the only Americans to have a national holiday observed in
      their honor.</strong></p><p>While the federal holiday passed in 1983, it
      took longer for all the states to *also* celebrate Martin Luther King
      Jr.’s birthday. In 1999, New Hampshire was the last state to pass
      legislation to recognize the day.</p></div>

      <div><p>Stevie Wonder wrote his famous song “Happy Birthday” in 1980 and
      released it as a rallying cry for the promotion of the holiday. Though MLK
      Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, his birthday is celebrated on the third
      Monday in January in order to remain consistent with other federal
      holidays.</p><p></p></div>
