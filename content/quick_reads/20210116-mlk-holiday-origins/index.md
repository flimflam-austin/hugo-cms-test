      ## Timeline


      * Martin Luther King Jr. born Jan. 15, 1929.

      * The pastor, civil rights leader & youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace
      Prize (at 35) was killed in 1968, at 39.

      * Four days after his death, Rep. John Conyers Jr., a trailblazing
      African-American congressman, began advocating to make MLK’s birthday a
      federal holiday. He presented the bill every Congress until it was
      established in 1983.

      ## How Did It Gain Support?


      * 1979: Pres. Carter publicly pledged support; Coretta Scott King, MLK’s
      widow, began lobbying Congress for the holiday – but the first vote
      failed.

      * 1983: Momentum gathered. Hundreds of thousands gathered in D.C. to mark
      20 yrs since the March on Washington (when King made his famous “I have a
      dream…” speech). Congress passed the holiday into law.

      > “Dr. King’s was truly a prophetic voice that reached out over the chasms
      of hostility, prejudice, ignorance, and fear to touch the conscience of
      America. He challenged us to make real the promise of America as a land of
      freedom, equality, opportunity, and brotherhood.”


      Pres. Ronald Reagan on January 18, 1986, on observing the first MLK
      holiday - three years after Congress approved the holiday bill.

      ## Why It Matters


      **Martin Luther King Jr. and George Washington are the only Americans to
      have a national holiday observed in their honor.**


      While the federal holiday passed in 1983, it took longer for all the
      states to *also* celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. In 1999, New
      Hampshire was the last state to pass legislation to recognize the day.

      Stevie Wonder wrote his famous song “Happy Birthday” in 1980 and released
      it as a rallying cry for the promotion of the holiday. Though MLK Jr. was
      born on January 15, 1929, his birthday is celebrated on the third Monday
      in January in order to remain consistent with other federal holidays.
