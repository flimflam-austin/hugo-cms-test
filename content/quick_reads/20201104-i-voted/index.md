      <div><blockquote>“To me, this sticker means that my voice is heard… It
      means that I have spoken up for what I feel is right for myself, my family
      and this country.”</blockquote><p>Alabama voter Dawn Holman, who says she
      waited 3.5 hours to vote in the 2020 election and she'd happily do it

      <div><blockquote>“People who get the sticker have already voted, so
      they’re motivated enough for it to have worked in the first place. If we
      could find the people who didn’t vote and give them a sticker saying ‘I
      Didn’t Vote,’ that could cause a greater increase in
      turnout.”</blockquote><p>Prof. Costas Panagopoulos, Fordham University,
      found people are more likely to vote again if they're thanked for voting
      in a prior election. Other research shows some vote to avoid shame of not
      voting.</p></div>
