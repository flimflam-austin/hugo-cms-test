      ## BACKSTORY


      * No one really knows who “invented” the “I Voted” sticker:

      * **1982:** Some say the tradition was created by Florida businesses
      offering discounts to patrons with a sticker.

      * **1985:** The Phoenix Assoc. of Realtors claims first use of “I Voted”
      stickers.

      * **1987:** An election supply company copyrights iconic waving-flag
      design.

      * **1988:** The stickers are widely distributed throughout the U.S.

      > “To me, this sticker means that my voice is heard… It means that I have
      spoken up for what I feel is right for myself, my family and this
      country.”


      Alabama voter Dawn Holman, who says she waited 3.5 hours to vote in the

      > “People who get the sticker have already voted, so they’re motivated
      enough for it to have worked in the first place. If we could find the
      people who didn’t vote and give them a sticker saying ‘I Didn’t Vote,’
      that could cause a greater increase in turnout.”


      Prof. Costas Panagopoulos, Fordham University, found people are more
      likely to vote again if they're thanked for voting in a prior election.
      Other research shows some vote to avoid shame of not voting.
