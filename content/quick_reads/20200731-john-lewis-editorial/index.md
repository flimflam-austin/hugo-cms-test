* _“Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself.”_
* _“The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.”_
* _“The truth does not change, and that is why the answers worked out long ago can help you find solutions to the challenges of our time.”_
* _“…walk with the wind, brothers and sisters, and let the spirit of peace and the power of everlasting love be your guide.”_

**A young man who met Congressman Lewis recited Lewis’ favorite poem “[Invictus](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus)” at his funeral.**

_Out of the night that covers me,_

_Black as the pit from pole to pole,_

_I thank whatever gods may be_

_For my unconquerable soul._

_In the fell clutch of circumstance_

_I have not winced nor cried aloud._

_Under the bludgeonings of chance_

_My head is bloody, but unbowed._

_Beyond this place of wrath and tears_

_Looms but the Horror of the shade,_

_And yet the menace of the years_

_Finds and shall find me unafraid._

_It matters not how strait the gate,_

_How charged with punishments the scroll,_

_I am the master of my fate,_

_I am the captain of my soul._

_William Ernest Henley_
