      ### A new study from the CDC takes a closer look at the *potential* impact
      of statewide mask mandates and indoor dining on COVID-19 cases.


      ### Here’s what the study shows & why it matters.

      ## The Research


      * Time period: March 1 – Dec. 31, 2020

      * Many states had mandates/restrictions in place early in the pandemic and
      lifted mitigation efforts at varying times.

      * The CDC compared before/after data at a county level.

      * Outcomes examined: growth rate of COVID-19 cases by county and county
      deaths (death growth rates) in the days after implementation (days 1-20,
      21-40, 41-60, 61-80, + 81-100).

      ## The Results


      * Within 20 days of a statewide mask mandate, counties showed a decrease
      in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

      * After 40 days (about 6 wks) after restaurants “reopened,” counties
      showed an increase in COVID-19 cases & a rise in deaths several weeks
      later.

      * _“State mask mandates and prohibiting on-premises dining at restaurants
      help limit potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, reducing community
      transmission of COVID-19.” -CDC_

      dining.”


      > CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said with the level of transmission
      and COVID-19 variants in 48 states, this study shows the value of
      mitigation efforts: “It also serves as a warning about prematurely lifting
      these prevention measures."

      ## Limitations Of The Study


      * _“Compliance with and enforcement of policies were not measured.” CDC_

      * Most of America permits indoor dining of *some kind* – the CDC did not
      measure differences in how it was practiced (Did restaurants follow
      capacity limits? Outdoor dining available? etc.).

      * Varying mitigation efforts place to place (such as gathering
      restrictions + distancing) could impact results.

      > “If a positive correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks is
      found, that would not mean that ice cream causes shark attacks.”


      > The National Restaurant Association calls the CDC study “an ill-informed
      attack on the industry hardest-hit by the pandemic,” arguing restaurants
      typically have to follow many safety requirements to operate during the
      pandemic. The group says "myriad variables" could have led to the CDC's
      conclusions, as in the maxim "Correlation does not equal causation."

      > “We are maintaining the masks.”


      Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont who announced his state will resume
      restaurant dining at 100% capacity but with some restrictions (such as
      earlier closing times). Connecticut will maintain the statewide mask
      mandate, unlike other states such as Texas and Mississippi that will
      forego the policy. The differences in the timing of state mitigation
      efforts, infection rates, and cultural & regional differences in lifestyle
      are all variables to research.

      The CDC calls the difference of infections and statewide mask mandates (an
      ultimate decrease of nearly 2%) & indoor dining reopening (an increase of
      about 1%) "statistically significant." Those statistics slightly change
      during every 20-day interval the study highlights. You can see the
      percentages for yourself on our source page.

CDC Director Statement: “You have decreases in cases and deaths when you wear masks, and you have increases in cases and deaths when you have in-person restaurant dining,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., said on Friday. “And so we would advocate for policies, certainly while we’re at this plateau of a high number of cases, that would listen to that public health science.” [(NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/health/coronavirus-restaurant-dining-masks.html)

“This report is a critical reminder that with the current levels of Covid-19 in communities, and the continued spread of more transmissible virus variants, which have now been detected in 48 states, strictly followed prevention measures remain essential for putting an end to this pandemic,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 press briefing on Friday.

“It also serves as a warning about prematurely lifting these prevention measures,” Walensky said. [(CNBC)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/cdc-study-finds-easing-mask-mandates-led-to-higher-covid-cases-and-deaths.html)
