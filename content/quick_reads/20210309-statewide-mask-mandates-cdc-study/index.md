      <div><h2>The Research</h2><ul><li>Time period: March 1 – Dec. 31,
      2020</li><li>Many states had mandates/restrictions in place early in the
      pandemic and lifted mitigation efforts at varying times.</li><li>The CDC
      compared before/after data at a county level.</li><li>Outcomes examined:
      growth rate of COVID-19 cases by county and county deaths (death growth
      rates) in the days after implementation (days 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, +
      81-100).</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The Results</h2><ul><li>Within 20 days of a statewide mask
      mandate, counties showed a decrease in COVID-19 cases and
      deaths.</li><li>After 40 days (about 6 wks) after restaurants “reopened,”
      counties showed an increase in COVID-19 cases &amp; a rise in deaths
      several weeks later.</li><li><em>“State mask mandates and prohibiting
      on-premises dining at restaurants help limit potential exposure to
      SARS-CoV-2, reducing community transmission of COVID-19.”

      differences in how it was practiced (Did restaurants follow capacity
      limits? Outdoor dining available? etc.).</li><li>Varying mitigation
      efforts place to place (such as gathering restrictions + distancing) could

      <div><blockquote>“If a positive correlation between ice cream sales and
      shark attacks is found, that would not mean that ice cream causes shark
      attacks.”</blockquote><blockquote>The National Restaurant Association
      calls the CDC study “an ill-informed attack on the industry hardest-hit by
      the pandemic,” arguing restaurants typically have to follow many safety
      requirements to operate during the pandemic. The group says "myriad
      variables" could have led to the CDC's conclusions, as in the maxim
      "Correlation does not equal causation."</blockquote></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We are maintaining the
      masks.”</blockquote><p>Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont who announced his
      state will resume restaurant dining at 100% capacity but with some
      restrictions (such as earlier closing times). Connecticut will maintain
      the statewide mask mandate, unlike other states such as Texas and
      Mississippi that will forego the policy. The differences in the timing of
      state mitigation efforts, infection rates, and cultural &amp; regional
      differences in lifestyle are all variables to research.</p></div>

      <p>The CDC calls the difference of infections and statewide mask mandates
      (an ultimate decrease of nearly 2%) &amp; indoor dining reopening (an
      increase of about 1%) "statistically significant." Those statistics
      slightly change during every 20-day interval the study highlights. You can
      see the percentages for yourself on our source page.</p>

CDC Director Statement: “You have decreases in cases and deaths when you wear masks, and you have increases in cases and deaths when you have in-person restaurant dining,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., said on Friday. “And so we would advocate for policies, certainly while we’re at this plateau of a high number of cases, that would listen to that public health science.” [(NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/health/coronavirus-restaurant-dining-masks.html)

“This report is a critical reminder that with the current levels of Covid-19 in communities, and the continued spread of more transmissible virus variants, which have now been detected in 48 states, strictly followed prevention measures remain essential for putting an end to this pandemic,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 press briefing on Friday.

“It also serves as a warning about prematurely lifting these prevention measures,” Walensky said. [(CNBC)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/cdc-study-finds-easing-mask-mandates-led-to-higher-covid-cases-and-deaths.html)
