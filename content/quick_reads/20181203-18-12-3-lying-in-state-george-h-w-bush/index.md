      ## Why We Do It:


      * A royal tradition adopted in America. Started with Sec. of State Henry
      Clay in 1852. Today, the decision to bestow the honor is made by Congress.

      * Previously, 11 U.S Presidents have lain in state: Presidents Ford,
      Reagan, Johnson, Eisenhower, Hoover, Kennedy, Taft, Harding, McKinley,
      Garfield, & Lincoln

      ## Pres. Lincoln’s “Support”


      * Catafalque: a frame that supports a coffin (cat-e-falk).

      * Pres. Lincoln’s catafalque from 1865 has held most of the coffins that
      have lain in state.

      * The catafalque has had minor restorations since 1865 (retrofitted to
      hold larger coffins, drapery replaced), but for the most part, it remains
      like the original.

      ## Lie in \*State\* vs \*Honor\*


      * Average citizens cannot “lie in state”A as that honor is reserved forA
      gov’t & military officials.

      * Private citizens “lie in honor.”

      * To date, only four Americans have “lain in honor” at the U.S. Capitol:
      Rev. Billy Graham, two police officers killed during an attack on the U.S.
      Capitol & Rosa Parks (only woman to lie in state or honor).

      half-staff for 30 days from his day of passing.
