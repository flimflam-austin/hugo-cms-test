      ## What To Know


      America is the largest economy in the world & its influence is
      far-reaching.


      Multiple economic reports this week reflect the statistical impact of
      COVID-19 on the U.S. economy.


      Much of this data considered the first three months of 2020. Social
      distancing went into effect for only part of that period, in March.

      ## What You Spend


      A measure on consumer spending showed a significant drop in March –**The
      biggest month-to-month drop on record.**


      **Why It Matters:** American spending fuels the overall U.S. economy.
      Economists estimate consumers are responsible for two-thirds or 70% of
      economic activity.

      ## The Economy


      A measure of economic growth (GDP) showed a contracting or shrinking
      economy, rather than an expanding economy.


      **Why It Matters:** Two consecutive quarters (a 3-month-period) of GDP
      commonly signals a recession. Before this drop, the U.S. had experienced
      the longest period of economic expansion in history.

      ## The Job Market


      More than 30M Americans have filed for unemployment in the last six week
      period.


      **Why It Matters**: Jobs fuel spending, spending fuels the economy. One
      estimate shows 1 out of 5 workers impacted by COVID-19. While some may
      receive unemployment benefits, others may not and be excluded from these
      numbers.

      ## Something To Consider

      Economic data, in general, reflects the past – a snapshot in time.

      By the time data shows a recession, America will have already been in it.

      Likewise, a recovery won’t be noted until after it’s already underway.

      April is the first full month the U.S. was under federal social distancing
      guidelines. A new jobs report will reveal the updated unemployment rate,
      considering April, on Friday, May 8th.
