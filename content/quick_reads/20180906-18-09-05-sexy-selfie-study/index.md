      <blockquote>"So, when a young woman adjusts her bikini provocatively with
      her phone at the ready, don’t think of her as vacuous or as a victim.
      Think of her as a strategic player in a complex social and evolutionary
      game. She’s out to maximise her lot in life, just like
      everyone."<br><br><br>Dr Khandis Blake, lead author, UNSW Science’s School

      <div><p>"In evolutionary terms, these kinds of behaviors are completely
      rational, even adaptive. The basic idea is that the way people compete for
      mates, and the things they do to put themselves at the top of the
      hierarchy are really important." Read more about the study here:</p><p><a
