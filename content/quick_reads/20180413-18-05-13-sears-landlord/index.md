      ## Bid to be a Sears Landlord


      * Bids due by May 1st.

      * No word if there is a minimum bid.

      * Advertised as sale-leaseback deals, meaning Sears would make rent
      payments to the winning bidders to remain in the space.

      * BUT it’s possible, depending upon lease terms, Sears stores could close
      or shrink to take up less space on the property.

      # Sears’ Struggle


      Sears unloading assets to get some **badly needed cash**.


      Latest earnings: Sears’ **revenue fell nearly 28%** & **sales dropped
      15%**A – **its** **25th straight quarter of declines (more than 6
      years)**.


      Sears, which also owns Kmart, has **closed hundreds of stores** since the
      start of 2017.

      And then there were none... Later this year, Sears will close its last
      department store in Chicago, where the company was based for more than 100
      years.
