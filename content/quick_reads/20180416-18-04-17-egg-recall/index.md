      <div><p>EGGScellent News: In recent years, eggs have gotten a bad
      reputation due to the high levels of LDL cholesterol and saturated fat
      found in the yolks, but dieticians say the protein levels found in egg

_“AA red flag is there only for peopleA withA heart disease risk factors, says Julia Zumpano, RD, LD, of Cleveland Clinic”sA Preventive Cardiology Nutrition Program._

_‘There is no current recommendation on how many eggs you should consume each week,’ says Zumpano. ‘Research indicates that total saturated fat contributes more to LDL (bad) cholesterol than dietary cholesterol.’A She points out that egg whites are safe and a good source of protein. It is egg yolks that have the cholesterol and saturated fat you”re trying to avoid._

_‘If you have heart disease or high cholesterol, be cautious about the number of egg yolks you consume, and take into account all the other forms of saturated fat (red meat,A beef, pork, veal and lamb, poultry skin, whole-milk dairy or full-fat cheese) in your diet,’ says Zumpano.”_
