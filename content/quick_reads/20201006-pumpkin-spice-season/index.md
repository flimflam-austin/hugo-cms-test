      ## BACKSTORY


      * First “pumpkin spice” reference dates back to 1796, but it wasn’t until
      1934 that McCormick & Co. brought Pumpkin Spice to store shelves.

      * McCormick uses cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg & allspice – but**no pumpkin**.

      * Starbucks debuted the Pumpkin Spice Latte (“PSL”), which features
      cinnamon, nutmeg, clove (and, recently, pumpkin) in 2003. It’s credited w/
      the pumpkin spice craze we’re familiar with today.

      ## WHY IT MATTERS


      > “Pumpkin spice seems to have taken off to an unusual degree, perhaps
      because it has such nostalgic connections to an element of American
      culture that we are increasingly afraid of losing touch with.”  
        
      Professor Montana Miller, Bowling Green State University, on why the
      pumpkin spice craze resonates with so many Americans.
