      ## Hanukkah means “dedication” in Hebrew


      * The story of Hanukkah does not appear in the Torah (24 books of the
      Bible) because the events took place after it was written.

      * The holiday celebrates the rededication of the **Holy Temple** in
      Jerusalem in 2nd century BCE when, after years of suffering oppression and
      religious persecution by the Syrian-Greeks, the Jews took back their
      Temple.

      ## The Miracle of Hanukkah  



      * The Jews had just one jar of oil to light the Temple menorah. It was
      expected to last only one day, but it lasted 8 — leaving them time to find
      more oil.

      * Hanukkah lasts eight nights.

      * The holiday is celebrated by lighting candles on a nine-branched
      **menorah**.

      * One more candle is lit each night until all eight are lit on the final
      night.

      * The middle (“helper”) candle is used to light the other candles.

      ## Hanukkah Today


      * Though a relatively minor Jewish holiday compared to others, such as
      Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) & Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), Hanukkah
      is widely celebrated.

      * Besides lighting the menorah nightly, Jewish people eat foods cooked in
      oil such as **sufganiyot** (jelly doughnuts) & **latkes** (potato
      pancakes), & children play a **dreidel** (a 4-sided spinning top) game.

      ONE MORE THING: How do you spell it? Depends on whom you ask. According to
      the Oxford English Dictionary, there are 24 English spellings of the
      holiday; the most popular ones seem to be Hanukkah, Chanukah, Hanukah, &
      Chanukkah.
