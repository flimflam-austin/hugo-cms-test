      <div><h2>Hanukkah means “dedication” in Hebrew</h2><ul><li>The story of
      Hanukkah does not appear in the Torah (24 books of the Bible) because the
      events took place after it was written.</li><li>The holiday celebrates the
      rededication of the <strong>Holy Temple</strong> in Jerusalem in 2nd
      century BCE when, after years of suffering oppression and religious
      persecution by the Syrian-Greeks, the Jews took back their
      Temple.</li></ul></div>
