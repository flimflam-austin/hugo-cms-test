      of “freedom.”

      ## What Happened?


      Two U.S. aircraft carriers – the USS Nimitz & USS Ronald Reagan – and
      their supporting ships/aircrafts conducted military exercises on July 4th
      in the South China Sea.


      Days earlier, the Chinese Navy held its own military exercises.


      Both sides accuse the other of disrupting peace and security in the
      region.

      > “These efforts support enduring U.S. commitments to stand up for the
      right of all nations to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law
      allows.”


      U.S. Navy Commander, Task Force 70 / Carrier Strike Group 5 Public
      Affairs, on the military exercises by the carrier strike groups. The last
      time two aircraft carriers were in this region at the same time was 4
      years ago to show support for America's allies, as China claims this
      strategically-important and disputed waterway.

      military exercises in the relevant waters of the South China Sea to flex
      its military muscle.”


      > China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian. The U.S. Navy has held
      military exercises in this region before, including only a week prior.
      Chinese officials reportedly warned such actions by the U.S. "...could
      very easily spark an unforeseen incident."

      ## Overview: South China Sea


      * South China Sea is a major strategic waterway for both global trade AND
      defense.

      * *At least* 5 countries claim parts of the South China Sea (including
      Philippines & Vietnam).

      * China has not only claimed and aggressively patrolled this area, but
      also built islands for military installations in what the U.S. and others
      consider international waters.

      ## Why It Matters:


      International waters are generally considered anything beyond 12 nautical
      miles off the coast of a nation.


      This insures freedom of the navigation as no single nation “owns” the sea.


      China’s claim to territory far off their coastline conflicts with
      internationally-accepted norms, and reflects a more aggressive military
      posture.

      The U.S. is one of the few nations in the world with aircraft carriers in
      its fleet, with a total of 12 -- more than any other nation. China has two
      in operation and is working on bringing others into its fleet. READ MORE
