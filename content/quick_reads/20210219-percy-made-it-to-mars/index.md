      "I’m safe on Mars," NASA's Mars rover "Perseverance" from its Twitter
      account. The successful landing of "Percy" (the spacecraft's nickname)
      begins a two-year mission on the Red Planet, incl. a search for signs of
      ancient former life in areas scientists believe water flowed billions of
      years ago. The soonest we'll see Mars samples back here on Earth? 2031.
