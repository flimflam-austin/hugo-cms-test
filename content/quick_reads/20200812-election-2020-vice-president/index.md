      John Adams, America's first VP and second President. Initially, the
      Constitution was somewhat vague as to whether the Vice President's
      succession as President in the case of POTUS's death was temporary or
      permanent. Also, during those early years, Americans only voted for Pres &
      the runner-up got VP; Pres. Adams' VP was from an opposing party.

      ## The Original Constitution Didn’t Say Much About VP


      * It stated the VP is the President of the Senate, but only votes as a
      tie-breaker in deadlock votes.

      * It also stated the Senate must elect a president pro tempore (president
      for a time) in the VP’s absence.

      * The Senate’s official website says, “_Our Constitution’s framers created
      the vice presidency almost as an afterthought_.”

      ## The Amendments That Shaped The VP


      * **1804:** Eight years after Pres. Adams was left with a VP from the
      opposing party, the **12th** Amendment made the VP a **separately elected
      office** from the Pres.

      * **1967:** Four years after the assassination of Pres. Kennedy & seven
      years before Pres. Nixon’s resignation, the **25th** Amendment made it
      “official” that the **VP serves out the remainder of term if a pres. dies
      or resigns.**

      ## Four VP Fun Facts


      * 3 **women** nominated for VP by a major party: Geraldine Ferraro, Sarah
      Palin & Kamala Harris.

      * 14 VPs **became Pres** – most due to death of incumbents. 4 were elected
      – most recently Pres. George H.W. Bush.

      * Unlike the two-term limit imposed on a President, the Constitution
      imposes **no such term limit** on the VP.

      WHERE DOES THE VP LIVE? Since 1977, every Vice President has lived with
      his family on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington
      D.C., which is also home to America's master clock.
