      <div><blockquote><strong>“I am Vice President. In this I am nothing, but I
      may be everything.”</strong></blockquote><p>John Adams, America's first VP
      and second President. Initially, the Constitution was somewhat vague as to
      whether the Vice President's succession as President in the case of
      POTUS's death was temporary or permanent. Also, during those early years,
      Americans only voted for Pres &amp; the runner-up got VP; Pres. Adams' VP
      was from an opposing party.</p></div>

      elect a president pro tempore (president for a time) in the VP’s
      absence.</li><li>The Senate’s official website says, “<em>Our
      Constitution’s framers created the vice presidency almost as an

      VP</h2><ul><li><strong>1804:</strong> Eight years after Pres. Adams was
      left with a VP from the opposing party, the <strong>12th</strong>
      Amendment made the VP a <strong>separately elected office</strong> from
      the Pres.</li><li><strong>1967:</strong> Four years after the
      assassination of Pres. Kennedy &amp; seven years before Pres. Nixon’s
      resignation, the <strong>25th</strong> Amendment made it “official” that
      the <strong>VP serves out the remainder of term if a pres. dies or
      resigns.</strong></li></ul></div>

      incumbents. 4 were elected – most recently Pres. George H.W.
      Bush.</li><li>Unlike the two-term limit imposed on a President, the
      Constitution imposes <strong>no such term limit</strong> on the
