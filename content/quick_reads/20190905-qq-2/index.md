      <blockquote>“This is probably the best case scenario that markets were
      hoping for…”<br><br>Rakuten Securities Australia as the U.S. &amp; China
      agree to postpone new tariffs and continue talks for 90 days. Meeting on
      the sidelines of the G20 Saturday, Presidents Trump &amp; Xi's trade truce
      was broadly seen as "positive," but there is caution. If no deal is
      reached in 90 days, U.S. warns it will raise tariffs from 10% to
      25%.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Nothing felt safe. Nowhere felt safe."<br><br><br>Emily Grove
      of Anchorage, Alaska taking cover in her bathtub after back-to-back
      earthquakes measuring 7.0 and 5.7 rocked the area Friday, briefly
      triggering tsunami warnings. While Alaska has experienced powerful
      earthquakes over 7.0, it is rare for one to strike this close to a densely
      populated area.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed
      up.”<br><br>Rabah Mendez, protesting as part of the worst riots in a
      decade in Paris. Activists dubbed the "yellow jackets" have torched cars,
      looted shops, and even sprayed the famed Arc de Triomphe with graffiti.
      Over 400 people were arrested in protests Saturday, as riots against tax
      hikes and the high cost of living stretch into a third week.</blockquote>

      <p>“That’s a lie. And it’s not always enough to lean in, because that s***
      doesn’t work all the time.”<br><br>Former First Lady Michelle Obama
      speaking to a sold-out NYC crowd for her new memoir Becoming about why
      sometimes women can't have it all. Obama went on to say the Facebook's COO
      Sheryl Sandberg's feminist mantra lean in, which says women should be
      assertive to overcome workplace inequities, doesn't always work. Becoming
      is the best-selling book of 2018.</p>

      <p>“We just presumed it was gone. In the end, we had no choice but to walk
      away…”<br><br>John Drennan after losing the engagement ring he used hours
      earlier to propose to his girlfriend of 10 years Daniella Anthony. The
      ring slid off and ended up falling 8 feet down a utility grate in Times
      Square. Police tried to help, but it was too dark. By Sunday morning,
      NYPD's emergency services unit had success and tracked down the UK couple
      to return the ring.</p>
