      "integration of the Taliban into society and government is the only way
      forward," but the Taliban must meet demands they haven't in the past - for
      example, they must "address ongoing connections to al Qaeda," accept
      democratic elections and "uphold the rights" of women &amp;
      minorities.</p></div>

      a recorded audio message translated by The Long War Journal's Tom Joscelyn
      - who reports the Taliban are preparing a judicial system to enforce
      Islamic rule in Afghanistan just as they maintained prior to the war.
      Haqqani is designated a terrorist by the United Nations &amp; is on the

      al-Qaeda. </p></div>

      drawdown or -- or had any significant impact on the -- the mission at hand
      in Afghanistan."</blockquote><p>U.S. Dept. of Defense Press. Sec. John
      Kirby in response to a question about recent "deadly Taliban attacks" as
      America began its final drawdown on May 1st. The Taliban is reportedly
      behind a truck bomb that killed 21 people and injured dozens of others, as
      well as a rocket attack at an important American airfield; America
      retaliated against a Taliban position.</p></div>

      <p>Why This Matters: A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan provided safe haven
      for al-Qaeda as it planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks and propagated
      terrorist ideology worldwide, which spawned other attacks. A looming
      question remains on how the absence of U.S. troops will impact the
      security of America, innocent Afghan people and others elsewhere. Nearly
      3,000 Americans died on 9/11; over 2,000 U.S. service members have been
      killed in Afghanistan and more than 20,000 injured.</p>

### [Editorial Pres. Ghani](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2021-05-04/ashraf-ghani-afghanistan-moment-risk-and-opportunity)

_To avoid that fate, the Taliban must answer critical questions about their vision for Afghanistan. Will they accept elections, and will they commit to uphold the rights of all Afghans, including girls, women, and minorities? Negative answers to those questions were suggested by the Taliban’s recent decision to pull out of a peace conference that was supposed to begin in Istanbul at the end of April. The Taliban, it seems, remain more interested in power than in peace. A political settlement and the integration of the Taliban into society and government is the only way forward. But the ball is in their court._

### Insight from [The Long War Journal](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2021/04/talibans-deputy-leader-stresses-importance-of-judges-in-the-islamic-emirate.php)

In an intriguing passage, Haqqani refers to some pending “urgent decisions” that the Taliban’s senior leaders are prepared to make regarding the locations of their courts. These “courts,” which are “built in deserts and villages will be transferred to the office system,” Haqqani tells the judges. It is possible that Haqqani is referring to the necessity of running courts in Afghanistan’s more urbanized provincial capitals and district centers, many of which have remained out of the jihadists’ grip while the U.S. and NATO forces remained in country. Establishing courts in some of these areas will require more effort, given that the population isn’t accustomed to Taliban-style rule.

“I hope you have some plans on this matter because we are about to go into a system of power,” Haqqani says. “You have to be well prepared. I wish successes for you in all your duties.”
