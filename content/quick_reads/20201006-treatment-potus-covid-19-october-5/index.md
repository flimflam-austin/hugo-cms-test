      ## WHAT WE KNOW:


      * Pres. Trump tested positive for COVID-19 late Thursday going into early
      Friday morning.

      * He had some symptoms, incl. a fever.

      * Pres. Trump received *some* supplemental oxygen (not a ventilator) when
      his oxygen levels dropped below 94% (we don’t know how low).

      * While we have limited specifics on the President’s condition, the White
      House named some of his treatments.

      ## THE ANTI-VIRAL


      * Remdesivir: Rem-des-i-vir.

      * An antiviral *previously studied* for other viruses like Ebola and SARS,
      but**never approved for use**.

      * How it works: Makes it harder for the virus to effectively replicate,
      slowing the infection.

      * One of few therapeutics in extensive clinical trial for COVID-19. The
      FDA approved for emergency use authorization in May.

      > “…uncertain clinical importance.”


      A recent study highlighted some uncertainty about remdesivir's impact in
      hospitalized patients receiving a 5-day vs. 10-day dose of the antiviral.
      While overall evidence of remdesivir is still uncertain, data suggests
      some benefit to remdesivir in severely ill patients. Patients with
      non-severe COVID may have small trends in benefit, but at this time, the
      benefits are not statistically significant.

      ## THE STEROID


      * Dexamethasone: Dex-a-meth-a-zone.

      * Commonly used steroid for any variety of ailments from allergic
      reactions to bee stings to arthritis to cancer.

      * Purpose: Suppresses your immune response.

      * Why It’s Used: COVID-19 can cause your immune system to “overreact,”
      leading to complications that can be challenging to treat.

      “…there was no clear effect of dexamethasone among patients who were not
      receiving any respiratory support…”  
        
      Preliminary results for a study on the use of dexamethasone vs. COVID-19
      show lower mortality rates BUT no effect for those not on respiratory
      support, and warns "possible harm" in those cases. Doctors want to calm an
      over-active immune system but don't want to suppress a *helpful* immune
      response.

      ## “ANTIBODY COCKTAIL”


      * A therapeutic (REGN-COV2) made by a drugmaker: Regeneron.

      * Purpose: “man-made” antibodies boost your immune response to fight the
      virus – positioned as a treatment for those not in the hospital.

      * Experimental trials are small and preliminary. The treatment does not
      have emergency use authorization but permission for “compassionate use”
      for those seriously ill.

      > “We’re just trying to imitate and help an individual, help their immune
      system win this battle, win this race against the virus.”


      Regeneron CEO Dr. Leonard Schleifer said the antibody treatment helps the
      body "get ahead" of the virus, similar to the way a vaccine works to prep
      the immune system. The early trial included 275 people. The company needs
      advanced clinical trials for FDA emergency use authorization.

      From preliminary information, the President received an antibody cocktail
      early in his infection, a steroid treatment, and was put on 5 doses of
      remdesivir. As of Monday night, Pres. Trump left Walter Reed and returned
      to the White House. We'll update as we get more information.
