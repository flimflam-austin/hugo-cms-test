      susceptible to COVID, but they are more prone to severe cases which may

      likely to spread in congregate settings like nursing homes, where people

      <div><h2>CONTEXT</h2><ul><li>Nursing homes, subject to federal guidelines
      and state rules, confronted a lack of COVID-19 preparedness.</li><li>Many
      states &amp; facilities struggled with mitigation efforts such as testing
      &amp; whether to accept COVID patients from hospitals. New York &amp;
      other states ordered nursing homes to accept COVID patients, a
      controversial policy some say freed-up hospital resources but led to
      further infections and deaths.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <p>"The question is, are they going down because of the vaccine, or are
      they going down because we’re on the backside of the outbreak. … It’s a
      combination of both." Dr. David Gifford, American Health Care Assn.'s
      chief medical officer, on how to interpret recent nursing home amid
      declines in cases &amp; deaths nationwide.</p>
