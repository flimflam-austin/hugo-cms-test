      > “I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this
      could be.”


      Dr. Deborah Birx provided a graph Saturday showing America's COVID-19
      fatality rate of 11 deaths per 100,000 cases: three times lower than
      Italy's. She emphasized the need & moral obligation for information
      sharing during a health emergency, thanking Europe for early warnings
      passed to Americans. China, where the COVID-19 outbreak originated, has
      the lowest *reported* fatality rate at .33 per 100,000 cases.

      “This isn’t going to be like a light switch. It’s more like a sunrise.”  
        
      Seema Verma, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, on new guidelines
      for the "reopening" of America’s healthcare system. Elective procedures
      and some care/treatment have been on hold due to expectations of a flood
      of COVID-19 patients. She explained some hospitals have had to lay off
      staff or had unused capacity. Verma emphasized facilities need to have the
      resources/equipment to address potential COVID surges.

      Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb to CBS voicing concerns
      specifically about America's Sun Belt (lower southern states like Georgia
      and Texas) and southeast region, such as the panhandle of Florida, where
      specific counties are experiencing an uptick in cases. He said those
      states that entered the epidemic later will naturally see a delay in
      cases.

      if we had the swabs and reagents.”


      Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, one of several Democrat governors
      criticizing the Trump administration for a lack of leadership on COVID-19
      testing and availability of critical test components, such as swabs.
      During a Sunday morning interview, she asked the government to use the
      Defense Production Act to insure supplies are available.

      Pres. Trump announced Sunday evening the federal gov't will help increase
      swab production by 20M a month by using the Defense Production Act; the
      law allows the gov't to work with private companies to prioritize the
      production of urgently needed supplies/equipment. The President said VP
      Pence will hold a call with governors on Monday to help source tests &
      supplies - saying at times, states are not using their full capacity
      and/or have lost track of supplies.
