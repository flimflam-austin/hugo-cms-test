      <div><blockquote>“… potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and
      unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to
      usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the
      very engines which have lifted them to unjust
      dominion.”</blockquote><p>Pres. Washington in his 1796 farewell address,
      on the rise in power of political parties he described as "potent
      engines."</p></div>

      <div><h2>Why Only Two Now?</h2><p>There’s no single reason.</p><p>One
      famous French sociologist theorized American politics supports only two
      political parties.</p><p>Why? A “winner-take-all” system. A candidate who
      wins the most votes gets the win. With no reward for runner-up, voters
      want to vote for the *likely* winner, and the two parties stay in
      power.</p></div>

      <div><h2>BIG PICTURE</h2><p>“Every minor party or independent candidate
      who has run in modern history has taken some votes from (both
      parties).”<br><br>University of Wisconsin-Madison political science
      professor Barry Burden, describing how third-party candidates have shaped
      modern presidential elections. Burden also says despite popular belief, a
      vote for third-party candidates is NOT automatically a vote siphoned from
      Democrat candidates.</p><p><br></p></div>

      <div><p>Has a third-party candidate ever won the presidency in modern
      times? No. But former President Theodore Roosevelt ran as a third-party
      candidate and came in second to Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Ross Perot won 19%
      of the votes in 1992 but still didn't win any electoral
      votes.</p><p></p></div>
