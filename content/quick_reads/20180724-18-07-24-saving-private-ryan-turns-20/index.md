      # Saving Private Ryan


      * Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks & Matt Damon

      * Cost $70M, including $12M on Omaha Beach D-Day scene.

      * Spielberg didn’t use story boards for notorious D-Day scene, relying
      instead on photos & news reels.

      * The graphic violence nearly earned it an “NC-17” rating and prevented
      Spielberg from letting his 13-year-old son see his film.

      ## The Niland Brothers


      > Four Niland brothers hailed from Tonawanda, NY.  
        
      Brothers all served during WWII, but they were separated into different
      units after the tragedy of the 5 A Sullivan brothers, who served and died
      together when the USS Juneau sank in 1942 in the South Pacific.  
        
      Two Niland brothers survived WWII.

      > “The minute we finished the D-Day/Omaha Beach sequence, I knew we had
      something really special to show audiences around the world.A I think all
      of us who worked on that film – from Director Steven Spielberg down to the
      lowliest extra in crowd scenes – can be proud that we had a part in making
      Saving Private Ryan.”

> “When you make something as subjective and perishable as movies or scripted TV shows, being a part of one that rises above the rest and promises to be around for many generations is a remarkable experience.A When a project like that – such as Saving Pvt. Ryan – celebrates the rugged, determined Americans who fought and won World War II, it’s especially rewarding.A You never know when you’re making a movie, how audiences will react.A I didn’t have that problem with SPR.”
