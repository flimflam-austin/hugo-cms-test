      event.</li><li>Macy’s employees asked the company to have a parade for
      giving thanks and celebrating the coming of Christmas.</li><li>It was six

      <div><h2>History of the Parade</h2><ul><li>In 1927, balloons replaced live
      animals (one report says zoo animals scared children along the path). One
      of the first balloons? A 60-foot dinosaur.</li><li><strong>The parade has
      only missed 3 years in its 96-year history.</strong> Macy’s suspended the
      parade during WWII (1942-1944) and donated rubber supplies from balloons
      to the military.</li><li>First broadcast via radio; televised nationally
      after WWII.</li></ul></div>

      3 million spectators along its 2.5-mile parade route, will take place in
      front of Macy’s famous 34th Street store — without any spectators, but
      with plenty of cameras for the television audience.</li><li>Performers
      such as Dolly Parton and Pentatonix will appear live, while other
      performances have been prerecorded and will air throughout the televised
      parade.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Under the unique challenges of these unparalleled times,
      we felt it was important to continue this cherished American tradition
      that has been the opening act to the holiday season for generations of
      families.”</blockquote><p>Macy's on why they decided not to cancel this
      year's Thanksgiving Day Parade despite COVID-19 safety concerns. They
      reduced the parade's participants by 88%, excluded child volunteers, and
      added plenty of personal protective equipment.</p></div>
