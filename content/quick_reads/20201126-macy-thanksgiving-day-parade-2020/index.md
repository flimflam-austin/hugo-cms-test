      ## The Show Must Go On!

      ## The First Parade


      * The first Macy’s parade was a Christmas Parade in 1924. 10,000
      spectators came out for the event.

      * Macy’s employees asked the company to have a parade for giving thanks
      and celebrating the coming of Christmas.

      * It was six miles long, had horses pulling floats, and featured animals
      from the Central Park Zoo. There were elephants, tigers, camels — and
      Santa Claus made a special appearance.

      ## History of the Parade


      * In 1927, balloons replaced live animals (one report says zoo animals
      scared children along the path). One of the first balloons? A 60-foot
      dinosaur.

      * **The parade has only missed 3 years in its 96-year history.** Macy’s
      suspended the parade during WWII (1942-1944) and donated rubber supplies
      from balloons to the military.

      * First broadcast via radio; televised nationally after WWII.

      ## The 2020 Parade


      * The parade, which normally sees over 3 million spectators along its
      2.5-mile parade route, will take place in front of Macy’s famous 34th
      Street store — without any spectators, but with plenty of cameras for the
      television audience.

      * Performers such as Dolly Parton and Pentatonix will appear live, while
      other performances have been prerecorded and will air throughout the
      televised parade.

      > “Under the unique challenges of these unparalleled times, we felt it was
      important to continue this cherished American tradition that has been the
      opening act to the holiday season for generations of families.”


      Macy's on why they decided not to cancel this year's Thanksgiving Day
      Parade despite COVID-19 safety concerns. They reduced the parade's
      participants by 88%, excluded child volunteers, and added plenty of
      personal protective equipment.

      New balloons being featured this year are Red Titan and Boss Baby, pulled
      by special vehicles rather than held by volunteers. 1 in 6 Americans are
      expected to watch the parade this year.
