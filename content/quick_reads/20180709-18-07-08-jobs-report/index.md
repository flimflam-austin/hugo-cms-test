      <div><h2>Something To Consider:</h2><ul><li><strong>Latino unemployment
      rate fell to a record low;</strong> more women and blacks looking for
      work.</li><li><strong>Wages continue to increase</strong> – an important
      sign of healthy job market. However, when adjusted for inflation, the
      <strong>take-home pay is essentially flat to last year</strong>. Possible
      reason? More Americans fill lower paid jobs during summer months
