      # Why Women?


      **High Veggie Diet:**A Studies show women consume more fruits &
      vegetables, less meat & fewer high-fat foods than men.


      **“Health Socialization”:** High number of women effected may be a result
      of them relaying more information to their doctors.

      ## THROW IT ALL AWAY

      AZ.  
        
        
        
      Recall expanded to include romaine heads, chopped & salad mix.  
        
        
        
      **_“This bacteria can actually get inside of the lettuce leaf. Washing it
      doesn’t make it safe.”_**

      ## Where E. Coli Comes From


      Mayo Clinic: Lettuce can be contaminated by E. coli when**run off from
      cattle farms that have infected cows mixes with vegetable crops**.A While
      most cattle don’t develop symptoms, they expel the bacteria in their
      feces, which then contaminates soil & crops.


      Common inA**ground beef, unpasteurized milk & produce**.

* **WORTH-IT-TO-READ: OP-ED -A The E. Coli outbreak doesn’t surprise me**  
[http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/384268-the-e-coli-outbreak-doesnt-surprise-me](http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/384268-the-e-coli-outbreak-doesnt-surprise-me)_“Salad combinations of every type are available for the consumer, seeking convenient, ready to serve foods. All of these products are at risk for contamination due to the human and/or mechanical handling that is required to get them into a bag. The labels on the salad bags boast that they are triple washed and ready to serve._  
_They lure you into thinking that this is some sort of a sanitized food product. It is my gestalt that as we create more food items, especially the ready-made foods, we are further exposing ourselves to food-borne illnesses. During these outbreaks, the goal is to pinpoint the source of the infection. However, the bagged lettuce you bought because you didn”t want to chop a fresh head may be a mix of multiple heads of lettuce from multiple growers. Tracking the source is almost impossible._  
_****_  
_**From my perch in Texas, this is how I see these latest outbreaks. The checks and balances to keep contaminated fecal waste out of the food chain has been corrupted. Identifying the exact source of the outbreak is proving to be difficult and this may be due to the sheer size of the modern farming conglomerates.**The CDC is a world-renowned organization we should all be proud of A that may be stretched to their limits. Visit a Farmers Market this weekend. You”ll know the name of the farmer who grew your fruits and veggies by their first name.__Dr. Joe Galati is the president of Liver Specialists of Texas and author of the new book,A Eating Yourself Sick-How to Prevent Obesity, Fatty Liver and Diabetes from Killing You and Your Family._
