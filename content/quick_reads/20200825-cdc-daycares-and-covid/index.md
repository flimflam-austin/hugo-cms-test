      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><ul><li>Of 666 daycares, 29 had
      COVID-19 incidents by end of July.</li><li>Of the 29, 20 had one case
      &amp; no further transmission within daycare, five had 2-5 cases; four had
      2+ cases w/secondary transmission unable to be ruled out.</li><li>While we
      know the number of daycare facilities &amp; their capacities, we don’t
      know how many children/staff were actually in attendance to give the
      number of cases appropriate context.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“…what we’re asking the American public to do is to bring
      this virus to its knees…It’s in our grasp. But it is going to require all
      of us to embrace these mitigation steps. And we are going to need to do
      that for 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 weeks and then we will see this outbreak get
      under control.”</blockquote><p>CDC Dir. Robert Redfield believes social
      mitigation efforts like smaller class size made a difference in limiting
      spread in Rhode Island daycares.</p></div>

      <div><p>The study states the prevalence of cases in Rhode Island at the
      time was "low ... relative to other U.S. states." However, we don't know
      what "low" means in this case to understand how this example can apply
      elsewhere. We reached out to Rhode Island's Dept of Health and are
      awaiting a response.</p><p></p></div>
