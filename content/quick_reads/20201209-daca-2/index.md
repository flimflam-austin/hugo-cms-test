      ## DACA


      * **D**eferred**A**ction for**C**hildhood**A**rrivals.

      * The 2012 Obama-era program allows *some* who came to U.S. illegally
      before age 16 to temporarily “defer” their illegal status and also obtain
      social security numbers & work permits IF they meet certain qualifications
      (i.e. graduated from high school, no felony convictions, U.S. residence
      since 2007).

      * DACA**does *not*** provide for a pathway to citizenship.

      ## LEGAL LOOK BACK


      * **2017:** Pres. Trump ends DACA.

      * **2018:** Federal court halts his policy, ordering DHS to resume
      accepting DACA renewal applications. Legal battles continue.

      * **June 2020:** U.S. Supreme Court rules the U.S. gov’t didn’t comply
      with a requirement that it give a “_reasoned explanation_” for its
      decision to rescind DACA, finding the decision “_arbitrary and
      capriciou_s” under federal law.

      > “DHS wholly disagrees with this decision by yet another activist judge
      acting from his own policy preferences. Judge Garaufis’s latest decision,
      similar to his earlier inaccurate ruling, is clearly not sound law or
      logic … We will abide by this decision while we work with (the Justice
      Department) on next steps to appeal.”

      who have been unfairly denied their chance to apply for DACA and secure
      their future in this country. Our brave plaintiffs have said from the
      beginning of this lawsuit that their home is here, and the court rightly
      recognized that today.”

      NOW WHAT? Unclear. The Trump admin. is expected to appeal the ruling. A
      separate lawsuit led by Texas aiming to undo DACA is making its way
      through the federal courts. Immigration reform continues to be a heated
      issue for both parties, but major policy changes have come via executive
      action in recent years.
