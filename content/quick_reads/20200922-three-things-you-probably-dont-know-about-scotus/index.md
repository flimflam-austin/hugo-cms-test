      # Three Truths On The High Court

      Surprising facts on the

      ## The Constitution is silent about who may be a Justice  



      * Unlike members of Congress or President, the Constitution does not
      impose any age, citizenship, or residency requirements for Justices.

      * In fact, there’s no requirement that a Justice be a lawyer or even that
      they graduate from law school, although every Justice in Court history has
      received some form of legal training.

      ## The number of Justices is not set by the Constitution


      * The Constitution says nothing about how many Justices the Court should
      have; it left the decision up to Congress, which set it at 9 in 1869.
      Previously, the number fluctuated between 5 and 10.

      * In fact, only 6 justices are required to hear a case. When there’s an
      even number (ex: 8) of Justices, however, there’s a greater possibility of
      tied (ex: 4-4) decisions.

      ## The Court accepts about 1% of cases it’s asked to review


      * The Court receives requests for it to hear between 7,000 to 8,000 cases
      each year, but it only agrees to hear about 80 of them. 4 of the 9
      Justices must consent to hear a case.

      * The vast majority of cases heard by the Court are appeals from lower
      federal & state courts. The court has “original jurisdiction” in specific
      situations only (ex: disputes between two states).

      Our next Supreme Court Justice will be the 115th in our nation's history.
      Like all federal judges, Supreme Court Justices serve lifetime
      appointments. Congress may remove a Justice via impeachment, but that's
      never happened.
