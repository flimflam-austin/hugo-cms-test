      <div><h2>The Constitution is silent about who may be a
      Justice<br></h2><ul><li>Unlike members of Congress or President, the
      Constitution does not impose any age, citizenship, or residency
      requirements for Justices.</li><li>In fact, there’s no requirement that a
      Justice be a lawyer or even that they graduate from law school, although
      every Justice in Court history has received some form of legal
      training.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The number of Justices is not set by the
      Constitution</h2><ul><li>The Constitution says nothing about how many
      Justices the Court should have; it left the decision up to Congress, which
      set it at 9 in 1869. Previously, the number fluctuated between 5 and
      10.</li><li>In fact, only 6 justices are required to hear a case. When
      there’s an even number (ex: 8) of Justices, however, there’s a greater
      possibility of tied (ex: 4-4) decisions.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>The Court accepts about 1% of cases it’s asked to
      review</h2><ul><li>The Court receives requests for it to hear between
      7,000 to 8,000 cases each year, but it only agrees to hear about 80 of
      them. 4 of the 9 Justices must consent to hear a case.</li><li>The vast
      majority of cases heard by the Court are appeals from lower federal &amp;
      state courts. The court has “original jurisdiction” in specific situations
      only (ex: disputes between two states).</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Our next Supreme Court Justice will be the 115th in our nation's
      history. Like all federal judges, Supreme Court Justices serve lifetime
      appointments. Congress may remove a Justice via impeachment, but that's
      never happened.</p><p></p></div>
