      <div><h2>BACKGROUND</h2><ul><li>Some minors arrive in the U.S. without
      legal status alongside a parent or legal guardian; others arrive *alone*,
      or with someone the gov’t deems unsafe (ex: child trafficker, a.k.a.
      “coyote”).</li><li><strong>“Unaccompanied alien children” (UAC)</strong> –
      what the gov’t calls minors (under 18) without lawful immigration status
      *and* no U.S. parent or legal guardian *available* to provide care and
      physical custody.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>WHAT TO KNOW</h2><ul><li>The Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS)
      apprehends those crossing the border illegally. They must transfer UAC
      w/in 72 hours to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), part of the
      Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS).</li><li>As their legal status
      is sorted out (ex: applying for asylum), ORR places *most* UAC with
      “sponsors” (usually parents or close relatives) or they remain in ORR
      facilities.</li></ul></div>

      Nearly 9,500 UAC – roughly 60% more than January.</li><li>90% of UAC who
      arrived since Oct. 2021 are between the ages of 13 to 17. Based on the
      recent past, a majority are males from Central America.</li><li>Gov’t

      <div><h2>LATEST ACTION</h2><ul><li><strong>February 22:</strong> Due to
      the recent uptick, the Biden admin reopened an HHS facility in TX (used
      briefly during the Trump administration) in order to house up to 700 UAC
      ages 13-17.</li><li>The White House said the facility needed to open to
      keep minors safe while families have yet to be vetted and while
      accommodating new pandemic protocols. Some of Pres. Biden’s fellow
      Democrats criticized the move.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Our objective is to get these kids into safe homes with
      their families as quickly as possible. And we are absolutely not doing
      what the former president did … which is ripping kids from the arms of
      their parents.”</blockquote><p>WH Press Sec. Jen Psaki on a former policy
      of separating children from their guardians during the Trump admin's
      "zero-tolerance" policy for those apprehended at the border. The current
      UAC policy is consistent with past administrations.</p></div>

      weeks.”</blockquote><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
      echoing the remarks of critics who attribute the recent spike at the
      border to anticipation of the Biden administration implementing more
      lenient immigration policies.</p></div>

      and the vast majority of people are being returned under Title 42. Do not
      believe smugglers or others claiming otherwise.”</blockquote><p>CBP Senior
      Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner Troy Miller. While CBP
      "encountered" more than 100,000+ people at the southern border, more than
      72,000 were expelled due to CDC pandemic guidance under Title 42 authority
      (public health and welfare).</p></div>

      <p>Comparing Jan &amp; Feb 2021 to 2020, UAC are up over 133%, but overall
      southwest border encounters for all (single adults, families, UAC and
      accompanied children) are up over 144%. Why? Depends on who you ask. Some
      say politics. Others point to the violence and struggling economies in
      Central America - or a combo of all the above.</p>

**MCCONNELL QUOTE**

> The Administration is flailing and failing on our southern border. The number of unaccompanied children has tripled in two weeks.  
  
  
  
The White House keeps saying “Now is not the time to come.” So there will be a good time in the future to break federal law and come illegally?
