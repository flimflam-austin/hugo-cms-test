_President Donald Trump”s tweet in advance of the crucial jobs report may have violated federal guidelines barring officials from commenting on data before its release._  
  
**But the Trump Admin. says:**  
_White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told CNBC the comment was appropriate since he didn”t put the numbers out._

> **And an interesting historical fact…**  
_Trump is not the first president to have crossed lines. President Dwight Eisenhower leaked the jobs report ahead of time, right before Election Day in 1954, 1956 and 1958._
