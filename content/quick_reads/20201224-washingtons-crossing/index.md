      <div><blockquote>“<em>These are the times that try men’ souls. The summer
      soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the
      service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and
      thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet
      we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict the more
      glorious the triumph.”</em></blockquote><p>Thomas Paine's "The American
      Crisis" reportedly read to soldiers Xmas night.</p></div>
