      > “_These are the times that try men’ souls. The summer soldier and the
      sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their
      country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man
      and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this
      consolation with us, that the harder the conflict the more glorious the
      triumph.”_


      Thomas Paine's "The American Crisis" reportedly read to soldiers Xmas
      night.

      ## What Happened:


      * July 4, 1776 – Declaration of Independence signed. British have many
      high profile victories.

      * By Winter 1776, Gen. Washington’s Continental Army is in retreat &
      running out of men & money: high casualties, attrition & low morale.

      * Gen. Washington takes a gamble, and hatches a difficult plan to surprise
      British forces the day after Christmas.

      the battle leaving **bloody footprints in the snow**.

      * Gen. Washington **surprised the British side** day after Christmas,
      winning Battle of Trenton quickly.

      ## Why It Matters


      > _“It’s really almost a miracle event, viewed by the population at the
      time. It looked as if the war was over…This victory is a huge morale
      confidence building victory that’s going to allow the war to continue.”_  
        
      Historian Clay Craighead. Washington's victory changed the early course of

      Even the British felt a shift after this battle. Some, like Historian Clay
      Craighead, point to it as a real turning point in momentum. Listen to Clay
      tell the story from the grounds of Washington Crossing State Park - It was
      a perilous night that changed America forever.
