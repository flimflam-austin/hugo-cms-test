      ## Backstory


      * Rhode Island allowed hundreds of its childcare centers to open in June &
      July with new COVID-19 policies.

      * Policies incl. reduced capacity, frequent cleaning, universal *adult*
      mask-wearing and symptom screenings.

      * The CDC released a report on what happened and hosted a briefing with
      researchers and reporters. SmartHER News participated in the media
      briefing as well.

      ## Here’s The Data


      * 666 of 891 (75%) daycare programs reopened in Rhode Island, with
      capacity for 18,945 children.

      * 101 *probable* cases of COVID emerged by July 31st of kids/staff; about
      half of those cases officially tested or diagnosed as positive.

      * Secondary transmission (one case spreading to many others) was limited.

      * **Bottom Line**: Cases emerged but spread was contained.

      ## Something To Consider


      * Of 666 daycares, 29 had COVID-19 incidents by end of July.

      * Of the 29, 20 had one case & no further transmission within daycare,
      five had 2-5 cases; four had 2+ cases w/secondary transmission unable to
      be ruled out.

      * While we know the number of daycare facilities & their capacities, we
      don’t know how many children/staff were actually in attendance to give the
      number of cases appropriate context.

      ## One Case Featured


      A sick 2-year-old attended childcare 3 days before COVID-19 symptoms
      emerged & 3 days immediately after the symptoms ended.


      10 of the 11 child care contacts in the same class were tested for
      COVID-19.


      No additional students tested positive for the virus.

      > “…what we’re asking the American public to do is to bring this virus to
      its knees…It’s in our grasp. But it is going to require all of us to
      embrace these mitigation steps. And we are going to need to do that for 4,
      6, 8, 10, 12 weeks and then we will see this outbreak get under control.”


      CDC Dir. Robert Redfield believes social mitigation efforts like smaller
      class size made a difference in limiting spread in Rhode Island daycares.

      The study states the prevalence of cases in Rhode Island at the time was
      "low ... relative to other U.S. states." However, we don't know what "low"
      means in this case to understand how this example can apply elsewhere. We
      reached out to Rhode Island's Dept of Health and are awaiting a response.
