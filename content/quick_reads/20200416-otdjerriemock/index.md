      <div><blockquote>“I didn’t think it was such a great thing; it was just
      lots of fun.”</blockquote><p>Jerrie Mock reflecting on her journey 50
      years after completing the trip. When she was 38-years-old, she left her
      husband and 3 children (17-year-old, 16-year-old &amp; 3-year-old) to
      spend 29 days flying around the world solo. During the journey, she
      managed a potentially deadly fire, brake failure, and wore a blue drip-dry
      skirt and kitten heels when outside of the plane.</p></div>

      <div><p>Mesmerized by flight as a little girl, Mock was 11-years-old when
      Amelia Earhart disappeared attempting her around-the-world flight. Like
      Earhart, Mock broke numerous flight records, but she insisted until her
      death that she flew mostly for fun.</p><p></p></div>
