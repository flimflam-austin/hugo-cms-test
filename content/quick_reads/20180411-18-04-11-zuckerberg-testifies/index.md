      <div><h2>GROWING PAINS</h2><blockquote><strong><em>‘I think it’s pretty
      much impossible to start a company in your dorm room &amp; then grow it to
      be at the scale that we’re at now without making some
      mistakes.”</em></strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Why it
      matters:</strong><br>The 33-year-old<strong>A</strong> ditched his
      trademark t-shirt &amp; jeans for a navy suit, but repeatedly reminded
      senators of Facebook’s early days.</blockquote></div>

      they’re doing anything improper, we’ll ban them from Facebook and we will
      tell everyone affected.’</em></strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Why it
      matters:</strong><br>Zuckerberg vowed to investigate “tens of thousands of
      apps” &amp; audit suspicious activity after Cambridge Analytica collected
      87M users data.</blockquote><p><a

      <div><p>FAKE NEWS &amp;<br>HATE SPEECH</p><blockquote><strong><em>‘I agree
      that we’re responsible for the
      content.’</em></strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Why it
      matters:</strong><br>This one is a biggie. Zuckerberg previously claimed
      that Facebook is not a media company, and takes no responsibility for what
      gets posted on the platform. This new admission could spell major changes
      for tech.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>RUSSIA INVESTIGATION</h2><blockquote><strong><em>‘I know we’re
      working with them.’</em></strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Why it
      matters:</strong><br>He said he hadn’t been interviewed by special counsel
      Mueller’s team, but offered few detailsA citing confidentiality. Mueller
      has charged 13 Russians in a plot to interfere in the 2016 presidential
      election through social media propaganda – some of which was on
      Facebook.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>NEW LAWS COMING?</h2><blockquote><strong><em>‘I’m not the type of
      person who thinks that all regulation is
      bad.’</em></strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Why it
      matters:</strong><br>Republicans have yet to back it, but the Senate’s #2
      Republican John Cornyn says people expect action. That said, in testimony
      Zuckerberg had to explain Facebook’s basic workings, highlighting how
      unprepared Congress is to impose game-changing rules.</blockquote></div>

      <div><p>Overall, Zuckerberg came out largely unscathed in the nearly 5
      hours of testimony. Facebook stock rose 4.5% on what investors deemed a
      positive performance. Zuckerberg will appear before the House Energy and
      Commerce Committee at 10AM ET today.</p><p><a
