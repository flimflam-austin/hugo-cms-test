      as they are, we have not reached the peak.”


      Dr. Birx said our social distancing efforts are working and that we're
      starting to see the curve of cases level off in the United States, but
      that we must keep doing what we're doing to reach the other side of the
      peak. "This is not the time to feel that, since we have made such
      important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need
      to be pulling back at all," said Dr. Fauci.

      > “We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically
      predisposed to get COVID-19… but they are socially predisposed…”


      Surgeon General Dr. Adams shared minorities are more likely to be unable
      to work from home and more likely to live in densely populated areas,
      heightening their risk and spread of COVID-19. He said they're also more
      likely to suffer greater complications because they're more likely to have
      conditions (ex: asthma) that make them more susceptible to severe cases.

      the right decision… without question it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever
      had to make.”


      Pres. Trump's response when asked about when and how he'll reopen the
      country. He added he wants guidance from his team of advisors. When asked
      whether reopening the economy in May will lead to more death, Pres. Trump
      said it could, but that "staying at home leads to death also."

      Dr. Birx said that we're in unprecedented territory because we've never
      taken a countrywide approach to mitigation, but that there's several
      different road maps to guide the decision on how and when to reopen the
      country.
