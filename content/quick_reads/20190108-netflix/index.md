      <blockquote>"Classical measurement has either been box office or awards.
      This defies all of it. But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate
      into something."<br><br>Susanne Bier, Bird Box Director, on the film's
      unconventional success flooding social media with memes &amp; the Bird Box
      Challenge in which people wear blindfolds as the film's characters do.

      Netflix’s foray into movies still new, but will couch viewership compete
      with theaters?</li><li>Film originally panned by movie
      critics.</li><li>Earned “R-rating” in theater, but no constraints in
      viewers’ homes.</li><li>Many artists rebuff Netflix, wanting a widespread
      theater release. <strong>Is this a game changer?</strong></li></ul></div>
