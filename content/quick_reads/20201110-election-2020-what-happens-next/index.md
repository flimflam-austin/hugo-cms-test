      ## DECEMBER


      * **Dec. 8:** Federal deadline for contested elections to be resolved via
      state laws.

      * **Dec. 14:** Members of the Electoral College meet in their respective
      states to vote via paper ballot, count, and certify their votes. Those
      certifications are paired with governors’ certifications, and sent to
      state & federal officials.

      * **Dec. 23:** Federal deadline for state & federal officials to receive
      certifications.

      ## JANUARY


      * **Jan. 3:** The 117th Congress (Senate & House of Representatives) is
      sworn in.

      * **Jan. 6:** Congress meets in joint session to count Electoral College
      votes. Members may object to a state’s vote results. If there’s objection
      by at least one person from both the House & Senate, Congress recesses
      briefly for a debate. If the objection is approved by House & Senate, that
      vote is excluded.

      * **Jan. 20:** Inauguration Day

      WHAT ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LAWSUITS CHALLENGING RESULTS? Given the
      upcoming federal deadlines, the courts will likely expedite the remaining
      lawsuits (many others have already been dismissed). However, most legal
      scholars agree the suits are unlikely to change the ultimate outcome of
      the election.
