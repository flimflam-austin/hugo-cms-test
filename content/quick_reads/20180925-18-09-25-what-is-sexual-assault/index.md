      <div><p>Some in the media have chosen to use the umbrella term "sexual
      misconduct" to refer to the accusations against Kavanaugh; misconduct
      includes, but is not limited to assault. Thank you to our SmartHER reader
      who asked for the definition. Keep the questions coming. We are here to
