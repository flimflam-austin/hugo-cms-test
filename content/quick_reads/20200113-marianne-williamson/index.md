      Spiritual adviser & best-selling author Marianne Williamson suspended her
      2020 presidential campaign. Her departure (and Sen. Cory Booker's on
      Monday) leaves 12 Democratic candidates in the race ahead of next month's
      first primary votes. The top candidates face-off Tuesday during the last
      major debate ahead of the first contest in Iowa.

* **Marianne Williamson Drops Out of 2020 Race**  
_Ms. Williamson’s presidential campaign was only her second foray into politics, after an unsuccessful congressional bid in California in 2014. But she is famous in the self-help and New Age communities, having written multiple New York Times best-sellers and been a spiritual adviser to Oprah.She opened the Los Angeles and Manhattan Centers for Living in the 1980s to support people with H.I.V. and AIDS at a time when they were often ostracized, and also founded Project Angel Food, which provides free meals to people with serious illnesses._
