      <div><h2>FUEL TAX CANCELLED</h2><p>"…if there is such a level of anger …
      it’s because we still have a lot of things to improve."<br><br>Pres.
      Macron speaking to French lawmakers Wednes. As the threat of more protests
      loom, lawmakers canceled the fuel tax from the 2019 budget. Macron didn't
      start the fuel tax - it dates back to 2014 and has gradually risen over
      the last few years. Regardless, Macron's critics say his policies favor
      the wealthy.</p></div>

      <div><h2>PROTESTS MAY NOT END</h2><p>“There will be more demonstrations.
      We remain mobilized."<br><br>Lionel Cucchi, protestor/spokesman. While the
      protests started because of the fuel tax, the anger ignited *other*
      protests varying from farmers wanting higher wages, to students, to
      truckers threatening to strike. One analyst described protestors as middle
      class &amp; squeezed by the welfare state - paying high taxes but feeling
      few benefits.</p></div>

      <div><p>America has a fuel tax too. Federal &amp; state fees typically add
      approximately 52Ac/gallon. These taxes have helped to pay for roads &amp;
      bridges, though debate rages about their efficacy. The nat'l avg. for a
      gallon of unleaded in America is $2.44/gal.</p><p><a
