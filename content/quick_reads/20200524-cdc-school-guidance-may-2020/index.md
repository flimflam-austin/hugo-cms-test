      <div><h1>Class During COVID?</h1><p>The CDC updates its guidance for
      returning Americans to work &amp; play during the COVID-19
      pandemic.</p><p>Here are the highlights for kids going back to
      school.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><p><strong>Reminder</strong>: CDC is
      not providing a legal directive – just recommendations.</p><p>CDC says its
      “<strong>considerations are meant to supplement—not replace</strong>”
      local laws and guidance.</p><p>CDC suggestions include disclaimers such as
      <strong>“when practical” and “if feasible”</strong> – we didn’t include
      these everywhere (redundancy!) but they’re used often.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Big Picture</h2><blockquote>“The more people a student or staff
      member interacts with, and the longer that interaction, the higher the
      risk of COVID-19 spread.”<br><br>CDC's May 19th "Considerations For
      Schools." This one sentence sums up a guiding principle for all the
      recommendations issued.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>Basic Recommendations</h2><ul><li><strong>Temperature</strong>
      &amp; symptom checks daily.</li><li><strong>Hand washing</strong> or
      sanitizing frequently.</li><li><strong>Masks for everyone as much as
      possible.</strong>*</li></ul><p>*CDC acknowledges this is difficult for
      younger students, and says masks should be worn when social distancing
      isn’t possible. Question: How does this apply to small groups of young
      students in a contained classroom? TBD.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Logistics</h2><ul><li><strong>Seating</strong>: Students should
      face forward – not facing each other – and sit separated if sharing
      tables.</li><li><strong>Hallways</strong>: “One-way” routes in hallways
      should be implemented to keep children/staff from passing each other
      face-to-face.</li><li><strong>New Design</strong>: Physical barriers or
      “sneeze guards” should be installed between bathroom sinks and in
      high-traffic areas.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Learning</h2><p><strong>Limit sharing</strong> – from books to
      balls to crayons to toys. Students should have their own assigned “gear”
      and not share.</p><p>“<strong>Cohorts</strong>” – this is a key word found
      in the guidance. The CDC suggests limiting the widespread mixing of
      students and staff, and emphasizes keeping people in the same small groups
      (as a way to limit interactions, therefore preventing or slowing
      transmission of disease).</p></div>

      spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground
      equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use.”</em></li><li><strong>Avoid
      spirit nights</strong>, assemblies, field trips and opt for virtual
      activities.</li><li><strong>Eating</strong>: Serve meals in classrooms
      rather than cafeterias.</li><li><strong>Sports</strong>: CDC advises to
      “minimize risk” with no specific guidance for different sports. More info.

      <div><p>During the second week of May, lawmakers during a Senate hearing
      asked health officials, including CDC Director, for more guidance on
      getting kids back to school. In addition to the paramount goal of
      education, schools in America have a dramatic economic impact by providing
      childcare for working parents.</p><p></p></div>
