      # Class During COVID?


      The CDC updates its guidance for returning Americans to work & play during
      the COVID-19 pandemic.


      Here are the highlights for kids going back to school.

      ## Something To Consider


      **Reminder**: CDC is not providing a legal directive – just
      recommendations.


      CDC says its “**considerations are meant to supplement—not replace**”
      local laws and guidance.


      CDC suggestions include disclaimers such as **“when practical” and “if
      feasible”** – we didn’t include these everywhere (redundancy!) but they’re
      used often.

      ## Big Picture


      > “The more people a student or staff member interacts with, and the
      longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.”  
        
      CDC's May 19th "Considerations For Schools." This one sentence sums up a
      guiding principle for all the recommendations issued.

      ## Basic Recommendations


      * **Temperature** & symptom checks daily.

      * **Hand washing** or sanitizing frequently.

      * **Masks for everyone as much as possible.***


      *CDC acknowledges this is difficult for younger students, and says masks
      should be worn when social distancing isn’t possible. Question: How does
      this apply to small groups of young students in a contained classroom?
      TBD.

      ## Logistics


      * **Seating**: Students should face forward – not facing each other – and
      sit separated if sharing tables.

      * **Hallways**: “One-way” routes in hallways should be implemented to keep
      children/staff from passing each other face-to-face.

      * **New Design**: Physical barriers or “sneeze guards” should be installed
      between bathroom sinks and in high-traffic areas.

      ## Learning


      **Limit sharing** – from books to balls to crayons to toys. Students
      should have their own assigned “gear” and not share.


      “**Cohorts**” – this is a key word found in the guidance. The CDC suggests
      limiting the widespread mixing of students and staff, and emphasizes
      keeping people in the same small groups (as a way to limit interactions,
      therefore preventing or slowing transmission of disease).

      ## Playing & Eating


      * _“Close communal use shared spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds
      with shared playground equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use.”_

      * **Avoid spirit nights**, assemblies, field trips and opt for virtual
      activities.

      * **Eating**: Serve meals in classrooms rather than cafeterias.

      * **Sports**: CDC advises to “minimize risk” with no specific guidance for
      different sports. More info. on our source page.

      ## Key Word: Staggered


      Staggered seating on buses.


      Staggered pick-up and drop-off times.


      Staggered schedules or rotating schedules (virtual school some days,
      in-school classes other days).


      Staggered use of shared spaces, like playgrounds.

      During the second week of May, lawmakers during a Senate hearing asked
      health officials, including CDC Director, for more guidance on getting
      kids back to school. In addition to the paramount goal of education,
      schools in America have a dramatic economic impact by providing childcare
      for working parents.
