      <div><h2>What Is “Use Of Force”?</h2><ul><li>FBI defines a
      “<strong>use-of-force</strong>” incident as one that occurs when an
      officer <strong>discharges</strong> their firearm or takes another action
      that results in someone’s <strong>death</strong> or “serious bodily
      injury.”</li><li><strong>Serious bodily injury</strong> = “substantial
      risk of death, unconsciousness, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or
      protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ,
      or mental faculty.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>BETTER DATA TO COME?</h2><p>In 2015, the FBI revamped the
      use-of-force data it collects. As of last year, participating law
      enforcement agencies are now asked to provide data
      including:</p><ul><li>Age, race and sex of officer &amp;
      person</li><li>Reason for officer’s initial contact</li><li>Type of force
      &amp; injury to person</li><li>Whether person resisted arrest, threatened
      officer or another person</li><li>Whether officer was
      injured</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>What Data Do We Have?</h2><p>Federal, state, local &amp; tribal
      law enforcement agencies representing <strong>41% of America’s sworn
      officers provided “use-of-force” data to the FBI in
      2019.</strong></p><p>Submission of this data – like other crime data – is
      *voluntary.* Many widely-reported figures come from independent analysis
      of police data by nonprofits &amp; others, some with political
      bias/funding.</p></div>

      <div><h2>What Did The Data Say?</h2><ul><li>In 2019, more than 5,000 of
      the more than 18,500 federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement
      agencies nationwide reported <strong>790 use-of-force
      instances.</strong></li><li>We won’t publicly know more details about the
      incidents (like race or circumstances) until more agencies report. We
      can’t compare 2019 data to previous years for context because the FBI is
      collecting data in a new way.</li></ul></div>
