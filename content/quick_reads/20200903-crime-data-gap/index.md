      # How Often Do Police & Citizens Clash?

      We actually can’t answer that question definitively.

      Here’s why.

      ## DID YOU KNOW?  
        
      No *COMPLETE*  

      National Database


      * Currently, state, local & tribal law enforcement agencies
      ***voluntarily*** report data to the federal government.

      * This includes incidents when U.S. residents attack law enforcement, as
      well as **“use-of-force”** incidents by law enforcement officers against
      residents.

      ## What Is “Use Of Force”?


      * FBI defines a “**use-of-force**” incident as one that occurs when an
      officer **discharges** their firearm or takes another action that results
      in someone’s **death** or “serious bodily injury.”

      * **Serious bodily injury** = “substantial risk of death, unconsciousness,
      protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of
      the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.”

      ## BETTER DATA TO COME?


      In 2015, the FBI revamped the use-of-force data it collects. As of last
      year, participating law enforcement agencies are now asked to provide data
      including:


      * Age, race and sex of officer & person

      * Reason for officer’s initial contact

      * Type of force & injury to person

      * Whether person resisted arrest, threatened officer or another person

      * Whether officer was injured

      ## What Data Do We Have?


      Federal, state, local & tribal law enforcement agencies representing **41%
      of America’s sworn officers provided “use-of-force” data to the FBI in
      2019.**


      Submission of this data – like other crime data – is *voluntary.* Many
      widely-reported figures come from independent analysis of police data by
      nonprofits & others, some with political bias/funding.

      ## What Did The Data Say?


      * In 2019, more than 5,000 of the more than 18,500 federal, state, local,
      and tribal law enforcement agencies nationwide reported **790 use-of-force
      instances.**

      * We won’t publicly know more details about the incidents (like race or
      circumstances) until more agencies report. We can’t compare 2019 data to
      previous years for context because the FBI is collecting data in a new
      way.

    body: "In light of the recent police shooting of Kenosha, Wisconsin, many may ask about clashes between police & citizens and vice-versa. The FBI collects annual data on incidents in which law enforcement officers are killed or assaulted in the line of duty.\_33 officers have been fatally wounded in 2020 as of Sept. 1."
