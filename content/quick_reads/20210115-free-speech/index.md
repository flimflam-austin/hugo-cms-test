      <div><h2>What Counts As Speech?</h2><ul><li>More than words! Protections
      extend beyond spoken or written words to various non-verbal actions,
      including:</li><li><strong>Silence</strong> (ex: public school students
      can’t be forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the U.S.
      flag, nor be punished for declining)</li><li><strong>Political
      Spending</strong> (ex: certain donations to campaigns or
      candidates)</li><li><strong>Symbolic Speech</strong> (ex: flag
      burning)</li><li><strong>Commercial Speech</strong> (ex: offensive
      ads)</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Is It All Protected?</h2><p>No! Some types of speech can lose
      their protection when they fall into certain categories, such
      as:</p><ul><li><strong>Intentional misrepresentations of facts</strong>,
      such as <strong>fraud</strong> (ex: an ad making false claims) or
      <strong>defamation</strong> (such as a tabloid’s false
      report).</li><li><strong>Incitement/fighting words</strong> – hateful
      speech/actions likely to cause imminent unlawful violence.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>BIG PICTURE: The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause is meant to
      ensure the free flow of ideas and protect us from censorship by the
      government so that no gov't entity (local, state, or federal) suppresses
      or punishes protected speech. How can businesses limit our speech? Next
      week on SmartHER News.</p><p></p></div>
