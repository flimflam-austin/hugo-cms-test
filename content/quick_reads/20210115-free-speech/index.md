      ## What Counts As Speech?


      * More than words! Protections extend beyond spoken or written words to
      various non-verbal actions, including:

      * **Silence** (ex: public school students can’t be forced to recite the
      Pledge of Allegiance or salute the U.S. flag, nor be punished for
      declining)

      * **Political Spending** (ex: certain donations to campaigns or
      candidates)

      * **Symbolic Speech** (ex: flag burning)

      * **Commercial Speech** (ex: offensive ads)

      ## Is It All Protected?


      No! Some types of speech can lose their protection when they fall into
      certain categories, such as:


      * **Intentional misrepresentations of facts**, such as**fraud** (ex: an ad
      making false claims) or**defamation** (such as a tabloid’s false report).

      * **Incitement/fighting words** – hateful speech/actions likely to cause
      imminent unlawful violence.

      BIG PICTURE: The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause is meant to ensure
      the free flow of ideas and protect us from censorship by the government so
      that no gov't entity (local, state, or federal) suppresses or punishes
      protected speech. How can businesses limit our speech? Next week on
      SmartHER News.
