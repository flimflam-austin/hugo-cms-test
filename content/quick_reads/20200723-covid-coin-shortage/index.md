      Dept,</strong> the Bureau of Engraving &amp; Printing makes paper
      currency; the <strong>U.S. Mint</strong> makes coins.</li><li>The Mint
      delivers coins to the <strong>12 Federal Reserve Banks</strong> that
      distribute coins to (&amp; receive coins from) our financial institutions,
      like banks &amp; credit unions.</li><li>Before COVID-19, 70%+ of U.S.

      <div><h2>Short-Changed By COVID?</h2><ul><li>Problem: Recent closures and
      reduced hours at banks and stores caused major disruptions to both the
      supply and typical circulation pattern of coins.</li><li>Result:
      <strong>SLOWER movement of coins – NOT fewer coins overall, but a smaller
      inventory of coins in some areas.</strong></li><li>Solution: The Federal
      Reserve says coin inventory issues will resolve as the economy opens and
      more people resume in-person banking &amp; shopping.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“While there is adequate coin in the economy, the slowed
      pace of circulation has meant that sufficient quantities of coin are not
      readily available where needed. With establishments like retail shops,
      bank branches, transit authorities and laundromats closed, the typical
      places where coin enters our society have slowed or even stopped the
      normal circulation of coin.”</blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve on June
      30.</p></div>
