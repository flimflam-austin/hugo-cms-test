Two years after going into hiding, in 1944, the family was discovered (only months after D-Day and the slow turning of the tide against Germany in WWII).

The family was sent to Auschwitz and later, Anne and her sister were transferred to a second concentration camp, Bergen-Belsen.

Anne was 15 when she perished with her sister in 1945, only months before liberation.

A [friend who had helped the family in hiding](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/main-characters/miep-gies/) had gathered some belongings after their arrest. She passed them on to Anne’s one surviving family member: her father.

Her diary is first published as the Secret Annex in 1947 and remains an inspiration to the world until this day.
