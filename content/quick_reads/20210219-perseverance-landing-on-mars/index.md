      <div><h2>Time For “Perseverance”</h2><blockquote>Will NASA’s newest rover
      make it to Mars?<br><br>It’s traveled nearly 300 million miles since
      launching in July, but its most challenging task lies ahead: surviving the
      “seven minutes of terror.”</blockquote><p><br></p></div>

      <div><h2>Why “Perseverance”?</h2><ul><li>Named after a 7th grader’s essay
      submission for the “Name the Rover” competition; NASA said the name
      “captured the spirit of exploration.”</li><li>The most advanced rover ever
      made – built with a navigation system, detailed maps, 19 cameras, and a
      microphone (so we can hear what Mars sounds like).</li><li>About the size
      of a small car and weighs over 2,000 pounds.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>“Seven Minutes Of Terror”</h2><ul><li>In just 7 minutes, the
      rover will descend towards Mars &amp; go from 12,000 mph to 2 mph in order
      to softly land… <strong>completely autonomously.</strong></li><li>Why the
      terror? The 11-minute communication delay from Mars to Earth means that
      when NASA’s Mission Control Center is alerted of the rover’s entry into
      Mars’ atmosphere, the descent &amp; landing – or crash – will already have
      happened.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><ul><li>Over at least two Earth years,
      Perseverance will explore an ancient river delta, paving the way for human
      exploration &amp; looking for signs of past ancient life.</li><li>It also
      begins a larger NASA mission to collect rocks &amp; sediment on Mars &amp;
      return them to Earth for study.</li><li>Since the 1960s, only about 50% of
      Mars surface missions have succeeded, leaving much of it
      unexplored.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“It’s just a matter of executing… Now, we just have to
      trust in our team and the hard work that we’ve put in until now, to see us
      through to the finish line.”</blockquote><p>Swati Mohan, who will serve as
      the mission commentator during the landing event. She is one of thousands
      of staff members who have contributed to this project over the last
      decade.</p></div>
