      ## Rosalind “Roz” Walter


      Born in 1924, grew up in Long Island & Connecticut attending prep schools.


      At 19, she began working as a riveter (drilling fasteners) on WWII fighter
      planes at a factory.


      In 1942, two men wrote a song called “Rosie the Riveter” after an article
      highlighting her work was published.

      > “_All the day long,_  
      _Whether rain or shine,_  
      _She’s a part of the assembly line._  
      _She’s making history,_  
      _Working for victory,_  
      _Rosie the Riveter._  
      _Keeps a sharp lookout for sabotage,_  
      _Sitting up there on the fuselage._  
      _That little girl will do more than a male will do_.”

      From the 1942 song "Rosie the Riveter.”

      ## Why It Matters


      * In 1942, ***many*** attempted to depict “Rosie The Riveter” as a way to
      recruit American women to traditionally male jobs due to a wartime labor
      shortage. Norman Rockwell painted one particularly famous version.

      * The image we ***now*** associate with “Rosie the Riveter” (1943 “We Can
      Do It!” poster) was NOT inspired by Roz, but by another woman supporting
      the war effort by working in factory.

      The wartime image of Rosie The Riveter was only used for several weeks by
      a private company in 1942 but gained popularity in the 1980s. A lifelong
      philanthropist, when Roz passed away at 95 in March, she was the largest
      individual supporter of NYC's local PBS station.
