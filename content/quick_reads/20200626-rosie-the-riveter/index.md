      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><ul><li>In 1942, *<strong>many*</strong>
      attempted to depict “Rosie The Riveter” as a way to recruit American women
      to traditionally male jobs due to a wartime labor shortage. Norman
      Rockwell painted one particularly famous version.</li><li>The image we
      *<strong>now</strong>* associate with “Rosie the Riveter” (1943 “We Can Do
      It!” poster) was NOT inspired by Roz, but by another woman supporting the
      war effort by working in factory.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>The wartime image of Rosie The Riveter was only used for several
      weeks by a private company in 1942 but gained popularity in the 1980s. A
      lifelong philanthropist, when Roz passed away at 95 in March, she was the
      largest individual supporter of NYC's local PBS station.</p><p></p></div>
