      ## September: The Basics


      * U.S. unemployment rate = 7.9% (down from 8.4% in August and**better than
      expected**).

      * 661,000 jobs added (**fewer than expected**) – job gains in leisure &
      hospitality, retail & healthcare. Job losses in government sector
      (primarily education) and private education.

      * **America has gained back a little more than half the 22 million jobs
      shed since the pandemic began.**

      > “The jobs number is positive, but it’s flashing warning signs. It’s
      decelerating fast, and that worries me. If jobs growth is slowing, it’s
      going to take us longer and longer to recover from this recession.”


      Former Treasury Dept. economist Ernie Tedeschi on slow hiring in
      September. The job market added about half the jobs it did in August, and
      a little more than a third of the jobs added in July. The start of the
      school year and dwindling economic stimulus may have played a role in the
      data.

      > “Women continue to bear the brunt of this recession.”


      Labor economist for Zip Recruiter, Julia Pollak says homeschooling forced
      some women out of the workforce. Sectors that tend to have more women
      workers like retail & healthcare have suffered during the pandemic. New
      data shows women in their "prime" working years leaving the labor force at
      much higher rates than men, raising questions about the long-term impact
      on women workers in the U.S. job market.

      ## Why The Drop?


      * The drop in unemployment rate came not *just* from job gains, but**folks
      leaving the workforce.**

      * To be counted as part of the labor force, you need to be**actively
      looking for work**; a mother who leaves her career to homeschool her kids
      is not counted as part of the labor force.

      * Permanently-unemployed Americans increased. The labor force shrank,
      pulling the unemployment rate lower.

      This is the final jobs report before election day. Economist Mark Zandi on
      September's job numbers: “It’s going to be a slog. The economy risks
      stalling out without any additional fiscal support.” Big topic to watch
      this week? If lawmakers come together for another round of economic
      stimulus.
