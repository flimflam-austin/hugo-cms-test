      in America shows a <strong>better-than-expected unemployment rate</strong>

      <div><h2>September: The Basics</h2><ul><li>U.S. unemployment rate = 7.9%
      (down from 8.4% in August and <strong>better than
      expected</strong>).</li><li>661,000 jobs added (<strong>fewer than
      expected</strong>) – job gains in leisure &amp; hospitality, retail &amp;
      healthcare. Job losses in government sector (primarily education) and
      private education.</li><li><strong>America has gained back a little more
      than half the 22 million jobs shed since the pandemic
      began.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The jobs number is positive, but it’s flashing warning
      signs. It’s decelerating fast, and that worries me. If jobs growth is
      slowing, it’s going to take us longer and longer to recover from this
      recession.”</blockquote><p>Former Treasury Dept. economist Ernie Tedeschi
      on slow hiring in September. The job market added about half the jobs it
      did in August, and a little more than a third of the jobs added in July.
      The start of the school year and dwindling economic stimulus may have
      played a role in the data.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Women continue to bear the brunt of this
      recession.”</blockquote><p>Labor economist for Zip Recruiter, Julia Pollak
      says homeschooling forced some women out of the workforce. Sectors that
      tend to have more women workers like retail &amp; healthcare have suffered
      during the pandemic. New data shows women in their "prime" working years
      leaving the labor force at much higher rates than men, raising questions
      about the long-term impact on women workers in the U.S. job
      market.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Why The Drop?</h2><ul><li>The drop in unemployment rate came not
      *just* from job gains, but <strong>folks leaving the
      workforce.</strong></li><li>To be counted as part of the labor force, you
      need to be <strong>actively looking for work</strong>; a mother who leaves
      her career to homeschool her kids is not counted as part of the labor
      force.</li><li>Permanently-unemployed Americans increased. The labor force
      shrank, pulling the unemployment rate lower.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>This is the final jobs report before election day. Economist Mark
      Zandi on September's job numbers: “It’s going to be a slog. The economy
      risks stalling out without any additional fiscal support.” Big topic to
      watch this week? If lawmakers come together for another round of economic
      stimulus.</p><p></p></div>
