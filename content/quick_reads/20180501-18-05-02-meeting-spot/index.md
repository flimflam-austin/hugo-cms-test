      # FRONT RUNNER: DMZ


      **DMZ** =A demilitarized zone, a tensely guarded area dividing N. & S.
      Korea.


      **Pros:** Media facilities & equipment in place. Speculation Kim may not
      have a plane capable of going far.


      **Cons:** Too close to Kim’s turf? Pres. Trump may want a grander setting
      for 1st ever meeting btwn aA sitting U.S. President & N. Korean leader.

      ## OTHER CONTENDERS


      * **Singapore:A** Has hosted high-level summits like this before. U.S. in
      favor, but N. Korea unlikely to support due to its relations.

      * **Mongolia:** Closest & most neutral neighbor. Kim can travel there via
      train (which he prefers due to security concerns), although trip could
      take several days.

      * **Longer shots:** Neutral European cities like **Geneva** orA **Oslo.**

      Millions watched Kim & S. Korea's President meet on Friday (1st meeting in
      more than a decade) at the DMZ. That has us wondering, why would N. Korea
      give up its nukes anyway? Check out one really interesting take here:
