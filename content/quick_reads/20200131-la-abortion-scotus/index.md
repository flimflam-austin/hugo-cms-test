      As both sides of the debate square off in the streets, the U.S. Supreme
      Court gets ready to weigh in on the first major abortion case in years.

      ## Law At Issue: Act 260


      * **2014:** Louisiana law (Act 260) requires an abortion provider to have
      admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the site of an
      abortion. The law never took effect due to legal challenges.

      * **2017:** Trial court struck it down. Finding only 1 clinic & 1 doctor
      would be able to perform abortions, court ruled it placed an “undue
      burden” on women.

      * **2018:** Federal appeals court disagreed and reversed the trial court’s
      decision.

      ## IMPORTANT CONTEXT:


      * In 1973, U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion *with limits* in Roe v.
      Wade, allowing states to set certain restrictions.

      * In 2016, the Court struck down a nearly identical law to Louisiana’s out
      of Texas, finding it imposed an “undue burden” on those seeking abortions.

      * Under current precedent, states can’t pass laws that impose an “undue
      burden” on the right to access abortion.

      “The true, and often overt, intent of legislators behind pretextual laws
      like Act 620, which have no demonstrable medical benefit, is to severely
      restrict, and ultimately eliminate, access to legal abortion under the
      guise of patient welfare.”  
        
      A friend of the court brief filed by 197 congressional Democrats arguing
      the law should be struck down. Groups like Planned Parenthood, and nearly
      22 state attorneys general also filed similar briefs.

      > “The burdens of Act 620 are minimal—principally, a modest increase in
      the waiting time (less than an hour) to obtain an abortion. The benefits
      described above are more than sufficient to justify that burden.”


      A friend of the court brief filed by the Trump administration, urging the
      court to allow the law to go into effect. A similar brief was filed by
      more than 200 Republican (and two Democrats) members of Congress.

      ## Why It Matters


      * The case is the first time the Supreme Court will rule on abortion
      rights since Pres. Trump appointed two justices giving the court a
      **conservative** majority.

      * This case is being closely watched by **other states** that have or hope
      to pass more expansive abortion restrictions, and face legal challenges.

      * Louisiana has only 3 abortion providers in the state. If allowed to go
      into effect, this law will further impact access.

      BIG PICTURE: Louisiana is just one of many states that have tried to
      restrict access to abortion, while other states like New York and Illinois
      have tried to expand access. The Supreme Court will hear this case, one of
      the rare cases on abortion to reach the high court, on March 4th.
