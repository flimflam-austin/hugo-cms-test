      <div><h2>Background:</h2><ul><li>In America, most decisions about
      education policy are made at the <strong>state &amp; local level</strong>
      – not by the federal gov’t.</li><li>Generally speaking, states set
      standards for curriculum and provide about half of funding for local
      school districts.</li><li>When local districts decide how to operate this
      fall, they will have to do so based on <strong>school reopening
      guidelines</strong> drafted by state education &amp; health
      officials.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We should try as the default to get the kids to stay in
      school. However, that’s going to vary from where you are in the country
      and what the dynamics of the outbreak are in your particular
      region.”</blockquote><p>Dr. Fauci explaining why, although it's the goal
      to get every child back to school as soon as possible, it's important that
      school reopening decisions are made on the local level based on the data
      and safety of children &amp; staff.</p></div>

      <div><h2>The Big Question: Format</h2><p>Not all school districts have
      announced fall plans, but proposals tenatively fall into three broad
      categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Remote learning</strong> (ex: Los Angeles,
      CA)</li><li><strong>Option of in-person learning OR remote
      learning</strong> (ex: Memphis, TN)</li><li><strong>Hybrid of in-person
      learning AND remote learning</strong> (ex: New York, NY)</li></ul><p>Many
      plans also include staggered class schedules to reduce overall class
      size.</p><p><br></p></div>

    body: "<div><p>This past week, NBC interviewed five pediatricians from across the U.S. about schools reopening. All agreed the benefits of sending kids back outweigh the harms and\_said they WILL send their kids back to school in the fall (assuming the schools are, in fact, open). You can watch their discussion on our source page.</p><p></p></div>"
