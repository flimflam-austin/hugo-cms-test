      <blockquote>“Parents have started to look at milk not as a good thing and
      they are wary of it. The message to them is not to be scared of milk, or
      to limit its consumption, and to encourage children of all ages to keep
      drinking it freely.”<br><br>Dr. Mona Eissa, The University of Texas Health
      Science Center, on a separate study that researched obese children &amp;
      dairy consumption, which found obese children who drank *any* milk had
      better blood sugar control.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Greater consumption of total dairy products may be of
      importance in the prevention of weight gain in middle-aged and elderly
      women who are initially normal weight.”<br><br>Study published in the
      American Journal of Nutrition 2016 that examined dairy consumption &amp;
      weight gain in women. The authors found women with higher intakes of fat
      from dairy had lower weight gain.</blockquote>

      <div><p>Overall, Americans are drinking less milk &amp; obesity rates are
      rising. Some say lack of dairy is a factor since we often replace milk
      with other beverages. However, docs caution suddenly consuming whole milk
      &amp; cheese isn't a good strategy for weight-loss or overall
      health.</p><p><a href="https://smarthernews.com/18-09-25-milk-study/">view
