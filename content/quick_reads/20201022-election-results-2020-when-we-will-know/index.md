      <div><blockquote>“A lot of people are worried that if it takes a long time
      to count, people are going to use that to say we can’t trust the results,
      when in fact it’s the exact opposite. It’s taking so long because of all
      these security measures to make sure the count is as accurate as
      possible.”</blockquote><p>Lawrence Norden, Dir. of the Brennan Center’s
      Election Reform Program at New York University, on why he believes time
      preserves election integrity.</p></div>

      voting numbers - early reports indicate more Democrats are voting early or
      by mail, whereas more Republicans are expected to wait until Election Day.
      Concerns about election fraud and reliability of results is a truly
      bipartisan issue according to one recent poll. Read more on our source
