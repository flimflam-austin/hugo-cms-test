      ## What Happened?


      * American utility companies infiltrated by Russian hackers**over the last
      2 years**.

      * Russians used**phishing scams** (where a fake email prompts the user to
      change their password & hacker gets the info) to infiltrate systems and
      steal data.

      * Number and extent of attacks is reportedly unknown.

      power plants (NYT).


      Russians could hypothetically access these control rooms through remote
      control (and they’ve done it before in Ukraine).
