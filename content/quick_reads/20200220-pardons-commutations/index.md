    body: "## THE BASICS\n\nExecutive clemency is the “_power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the U.S, except in cases of impeachment_” **granted to the President in the Constitution**. Two main types:\n\n* **Commutation:** Conviction stays on record, but sentence is shortened.\n* **Pardon:**\_Conviction stays on record, but civil rights lost due to conviction (ex: voting, guns) are restored."

      ## THE LIMITS


      * **The President is the ONLY person able to issue a federal pardon or
      commutation.**

      * The President need not consult with DOJ or provide any explanation.

      * **The President may ONLY issue a pardon or commutation to someone
      convicted of a federal crime.**

      * Pardons and commutations of state crimes are generally handled by
      governors.

      President Trump on commuting, or shortening, the sentence for former
      Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich - a Democrat found guilty on corruption
      charges, including trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by Pres. Obama -
      from 14 to 8 years (time served). The commutation of Blagovich's sentence
      was one of 11 executive clemency grants the President made on Tuesday
      (full list on our source page).

  - order: 4
    body: >-
      > “Blagojevich is the face of public corruption in Illinois, and not once
      has he shown any remorse for his clear and documented record of egregious
      crimes that undermined the trust placed in him by voters … As our state
      continues to grapple with political corruption, we shouldn’t let those who
      breached the public trust off the hook.”

      Celebrity Apprentice' star Blagojevich's sentence

      Tues. morning Pres. Trump held a meeting with former NFL players who had
      requested a pardon for a former team owner - they received it, and
      additional clemency decisions followed. One similarity between these and
      previous clemency decisions? Pres. Trump follows celebrity clemency
      recommendations.

_Trump has pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly two dozen people since taking office, including several after the urging of celebrities.The president commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving out a life sentence for a nonviolent drug offense, after Kim Kardashian West brought the case to the president’s attention. Trump also posthumously pardoned the late boxing champion Jack Johnson while surrounded by Sylvester Stallone and Lennox Lewis, among others. And he has granted pardons to Joe Arpaio and Matthew Golsteyn after their causes were featured prominently in conservative media._ [_https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/483445-trump-pardons-ex-49ers-owner_](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/483445-trump-pardons-ex-49ers-owner)
