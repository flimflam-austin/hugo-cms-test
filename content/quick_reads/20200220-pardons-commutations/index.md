**Trump pardons ex-49ers owner**  
_Trump has pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly two dozen people since taking office, including several after the urging of celebrities.The president commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving out a life sentence for a nonviolent drug offense, after Kim Kardashian West brought the case to the president’s attention. Trump also posthumously pardoned the late boxing champion Jack Johnson while surrounded by Sylvester Stallone and Lennox Lewis, among others. And he has granted pardons to Joe Arpaio and Matthew Golsteyn after their causes were featured prominently in conservative media._ [_https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/483445-trump-pardons-ex-49ers-owner_](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/483445-trump-pardons-ex-49ers-owner)
