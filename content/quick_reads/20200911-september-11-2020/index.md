      *could* lead to the full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

      * **Sept. 10:** Pres. Trump: “a lot of progress” in Afghanistan,
      referencing no U.S. deaths since early Feb. (4 U.S. soldiers killed in
      action *so far* this year). Pres. Trump spoke about lower troop levels in
      Afghanistan, and said the U.S. military is “pretty much out” of Iraq &
      Syria.
