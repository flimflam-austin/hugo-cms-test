      # THE VOTE

      election security.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * **New**: Georgia's new election law is the first major state-level
      election law to pass after the heavily contested 2020 election. Hundreds
      of election bills are working through state houses nationwide.

      * **Notable**: Georgia's election was particular close for both President
      & the Senate, with dems winning all three elections (the first
      presidential election by a democrat in GA in 3 decades).

      ## What Happened:


      > "We quickly began working with the House and Senate on further reforms
      to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. The bill I signed into law
      does just that."


      GA Gov. Brian Kemp (R) on the election law created after the November 2020
      election by republicans and passed along party lines (republicans have the
      majority). The law includes many different provisions – we highlighted
      several.

      ## ABSENTEE VOTING


      * Voters may request a ballot 78-11 days before an election. Previously,
      they could start requesting ballots 180 days before, and (in most
      counties) up until the Friday before Election Day.

      * Voters must verify their identity via their SSN or a # from a
      state-issued ID. Before, they could just sign their name.

      * The new law requires drop boxes for absentee voters to use, but limits
      the number, location & hours of operation.

      ## EARLY VOTING


      * Counties are now required to offer in-person early voting for general
      elections on two Saturdays, with Sundays being optional. Previously, only
      one Saturday was required.

      * Early voting is prohibited before 7 a.m., and after 7 p.m. Previously,
      counties could set their own hours.

      * For runoff elections, early voting will take place for about a week.
      Previously, it took place for 3 weeks.

      ## OTHER PROVISIONS


      * Voters who vote in-person, but outside their designated precinct will
      only have their vote counted if they vote after 5pm.

      * The legislature has more influence over the State Election Board, which
      has more power over county election officials and may intervene as they
      fit.

      * It's now a crime to hand out water/food within 150 ft of a polling
      station and within 25 ft of a person in line to vote.

      “I told him exactly how I felt: that these bills were not only voter
      suppression, but they were in fact racist, and they are an attempt to turn
      back time to Jim Crow."


      Bishop Reginald Jackson leader of the African Methodist Episcopal churches
      in Georgia recalling his conversation with Georgia's Lt. Gov. He argues
      the laws will deter voters, especially black voters in urban
      neighborhoods, and harken back to past laws put in place to purposefully
      prevent black voters.

      _"There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding about whether making
      it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has a significant effect
      on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence suggests it does not."_


      Correspondent Nate Cohn, New York Times, says research shows election laws
      don't impact voters as much as headlines & political fights suggest.
      Inspired voters vote; uninspired voters do not.

    body: "Remember - States remain in charge of state/federal elections but Georgia's law already faces a number of legal challenges by critics. Separately, the\_federal gov't is also weighing establishing federal election standards. The \"For the People Act\" passed the Democrat-controlled House in March."
