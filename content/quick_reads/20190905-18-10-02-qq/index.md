      > "Many people are still strongly against the idea of retailers opening
      their doors on Thanksgiving. Since Thanksgiving is all about family, a

      Phillip Dengler, BestBlackFriday.com - a website that tracks Black Friday
      sales. According to their survey, a record number of 60 retailers have
      already announced their stores (not their websites) will be closed on
      Thanksgiving, incl. Costco & Nordstrom.

      > “The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge
      Kavanaugh’s nomination is out of committee. We’re considering it here on
      the floor. And we’ll be voting this week.”  
        
      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KS) speaking on Senate floor
      about expected full Senate vote on Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett
      Kavanaugh. McConnell has not set a date or time; the FBI investigation is

      "We just ran. There were no sirens, no warning. Just the shaking and the
      panic."  
        
      Nurdiyah Rasid who lived through a powerful earthquake and tsunami in
      Palu, Indonesia - a city of nearly 400,000 people; 1,200+ have died in the
      aftermath and that number continues to rise. An early warning system for
      tsunamis hasn't worked since 2012. Officials used text message and social
      media to try to warn residents but the location of the earthquake produced
      almost an immediate tidal surge.

      “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and
      decided we want to lead.”  
        
      Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announcing the company will now raise the minimum
      wage for its U.S. employees to $15/hour and advocates raising the federal
      minimum wage ($7.25/hour since 2009). The announcement comes on the same
      day a large service industry union will lead protests around the country
      advocating for higher pay; Amazon has been pressured to do the same.
