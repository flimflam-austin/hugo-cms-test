An attack targeted the U.S. embassy in Baghdad in Dec 2020; another killed two U.S. soldiers in March."

      > “This is a test of the new Biden administration to see what they can get
      away with.”


      Analyst Michael Knights, Washington Institute for Near East Policy,
      underscored the seriousness of this attack to The New York Times - which
      reported "the size and scope of the rocket attack on Erbil was unusually
      large, and that it had most likely been intended to maim or kill American
      contractors or service members, or their Kurdish allies."

      ## Why This Matters:


      * The role of the U.S. in both Iraq & the Middle East is a looming
      question.

      * Report: militias are moving toward areas previously secured in Iraq.

      * Meanwhile, Iran is pressuring the new U.S. administration to drop
      Trump-era sanctions and rejoin the nuclear deal.

      * Pres. Biden ran point on Iraq as VP during the Obama admin.**What will
      define the U.S. Middle East policy in 2021 (and beyond) ?**

      U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken said the U.S. was "outraged" by the
      attack. The Iraqi President called the attack "a dangerous escalation" and
      "a battle of state and sovereignty against terrorism and outlaws.” Iran
      denies involvement despite those that call it a "Iran-sanctioned if not
      Iran-ordered attack."

[_Iraq Rocket Attack Targets U.S.-Led Coalition, in Test for Biden_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraq-rocket-attack-targets-u-s-led-coalition-in-test-for-biden-11613432824)

_Iraq poses an important challenge for Mr. Biden and his national-security team. During the Obama administration, then-Vice President Biden had the lead for U.S. policy toward Baghdad as the White House grappled with sectarian tensions and Iranian influence. (wsj)_

_U.S. forces in the area are equipped with a C-RAM, a radar-guided Gatling gun that is used to shoot down projectiles, but it wasn’t clear how it performed in the assault._

_Aziz Ahmad, deputy chief of staff to Mr. Barzani, said there have been new militia deployments in the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul and Kirkuk in recent days, including in areas that are supposed to be demilitarized. However, the governor of Iraq’s northern Nineveh province, Najim al-Jabouri, said no rockets had been launched from Mosul. (The Wall Street Journal)_
