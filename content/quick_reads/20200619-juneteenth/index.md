      <div><p>Juneteenth has risen in national prominence this year amid a
      reignited conversation about race in America that has sparked both fervent
      civil discourse and unrest. Pres. Trump rescheduled a June 19 campaign
      rally in Tulsa, OK (the site of a historic 1921 race massacre) to June 20
      because the rally fell on Juneteenth.</p><p></p></div>
