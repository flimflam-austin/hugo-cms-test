      > “I do believe you can sufficiently mitigate the risk of bringing COVID
      onto the football field or into the training room at a level that’s no
      different than living as a student on campus.”  
        
      Infectious disease specialist, Dr. Cameron Wolfe, chair of the ACC's
      medical advisory group. The SEC, Big 12, and ACC have decided not to
      postpone their seasons (for now). Regardless, some players (Syracuse

      > “You look at the overall numbers during this global pandemic, as far as
      caseloads, they have not decreased; they have gone up. Trends have not
      improved; they’ve become worse…it’s just a level of not only concerns but
      unknown risks. When you’re dealing with the health of human beings, it’s
      serious.”


      Commissioner Kevin Warren, Big 10; the conference postponed its season.

      ## HISTORICAL CONTEXT


      World War I **AND** the flu pandemic disproportionately affected healthy
      young people, and delayed & shortened the college football schedule.


      18 schools reportedly did not field a team.


      However, to help with training and morale, military services formed teams
      which also competed against colleges.

      > “It would be difficult to overestimate the value of football experience
      as a part of the soldier’s training….developing the aggressiveness,
      initiative and determination of recruits, and the ability to carry on in
      spite of bodily hurts or physical discomforts. These qualities, as you
      well know, were the outstanding characteristics of the American soldier.”

      fear of Japanese attacks on the West Coast.


      All college football games were canceled on the weekend after 9/11.
