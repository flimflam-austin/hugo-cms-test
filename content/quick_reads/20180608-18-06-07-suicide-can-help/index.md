      <blockquote>‘Suicide is a public health crisis when you look at the
      numbers, and they keep going up. It’s up everywhere. And we know that the
      rates are actually higher than what’s reported. But homicides still get
      more attention.’<br><br><br><br>Nadine Kaslow, fmr. president of the
      American Psychological Association to Washington Post</blockquote>
