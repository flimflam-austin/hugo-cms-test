      ## WHY?


      Studies show**90% of Americans misinterpret expiration labels**, and throw
      away food too early.


      Confusion:**10 different expiration phrases**. Food industry urging (but
      not requiring) use of only**A “Use By” & “Best if Used By”** by summer 18.


      **Did you know?** Federal law only requires expiration dates on infant
      formula.

      ## DECIPHERING THE LINGO


      **“Best if used by”:** refers to quality, not safety. Recommended for
      flavor.


      **“Use by”:**A date on products that could become less safe as they age.


      **“Sell by”:**A tells the store how long to display. Issue is quality not
      spoilage.


      **“Expiration Date”:**A last day to eat. Proceed at your own risk.
