      ## Oil’s Slippery Slope


      * **What?** Oil traded at 4-year high in October at**$76/barrel** and the
      talk at that time was that $100/barrel was next. Today, it’s trading
      below**$50/barrel**.

      * **Why?** There’s**too much oil**. U.S. crude inventories have**climbed
      10-straight weeks** to the highest level in a year, just as concerns grow
      over a**global economic slowdown** with less oil demand.

      ## What is the Perfect Price?


      > Goldman Sachs warns $50/barrel oil is not good for America, instead says
      a $65 to $70/barrel range is best for all.  
        
      _“When you’re in that level it’s not too high & damaging the consumer, but
      at the same time, it creates a stable environment for the industry.”_

      ## Why It Matters


      As of August,**U.S. is now the world’s largest oil producer**. Falling
      prices may weigh heavily on an industry that now represents a larger share
      of the U.S. economy.


      While lower oil prices boost consumers, ultimately energy producers will
      be forced to cut back, laying off workers which may send prices ultimately
      spiking higher.

      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets Dec. 6th. Its
      de facto leader Saudi Arabia is arguing for a cut in supplies to prevent a
      glut. But first, strategists will watch Friday's G20 meeting, including
      the Saudis, Russia, & U.S., for hints on what's next.
