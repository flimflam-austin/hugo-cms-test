      sponsor of terror since 1984; only 3 other countries (Syria, North Korea
      &amp; Sudan) share this label.</li><li>Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons
      (which they deny) has worried several U.S. presidents because of Iran’s
      connection with terror groups &amp; their desire to assert themselves as a
      superpower.</li></ul></div>

      <blockquote>“As victims of terrorism in the past and today, we have always
      been and will always remain in the forefront of genuine confrontation with
      terrorism.”<br><br><br><br>Iranian Pres. Rouhani during UN address. The
      U.S. State Dep't just issued an annual report underscoring Iran's status
      as a state sponsor of terror and highlighted Iran's relationship with
      groups like al Qaeda.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“We are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil
      to cut their purchases substantially. We cannot allow the world’s leading
      sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous
      weapons.”<br><br>Pres. Trump during UN address. America received pushback
      from China, France, U.K and Russia (the other signatories of the original
      nuclear deal) about joining in sanctions on Iran's oil exports; they want
      to stay in the nuclear deal, for now.</blockquote>

      "We've been clear; they shouldn't take us on like that". FYI: Iran fired
      rockets at U.S. embassy in Baghdad &amp; consulate in Basra in early Sept
      after blaming America for igniting anti-Iran dissent.</p><p><a
