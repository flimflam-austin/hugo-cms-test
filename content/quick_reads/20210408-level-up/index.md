      # LEVEL UP?


      ### A new study says ceiling ventilation may be more important than social
      distancing.


      ### Why this matters for classrooms and beyond.

      ## The Study


      * University of Central Florida, Dept. of Mechanical & Aerospace
      Engineering.

      * Researchers built computer models of classrooms with a group of students
      sitting in rows and a teacher in the front – all wearing masks.

      * The models replicated different routes for airborne disease
      transmission.

      * Classrooms with ventilation (with a good air filter) reduced
      transmission by 40-50%.

      ## Why Does It Work?


      * The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets –
      the fewer infected droplets hanging out in your space, the better.

      * Ventilation keeps the air in the room circulating - it also pulls warm
      air droplets HIGHER.

      * Study co-author: With both ventilation & masks, droplets tend to go “up”
      and away from others, rather than “out” towards people.

      > “The risk from airborne SARS-CoV-2 exposure does not appear to be
      strongly correlated with the distance, and many of the peak exposures were
      observed outside of physical-distancing guidelines.”


      The study went on to say that "mask mandates, well designed HVAC systems,
      and the combination of exposure time with number of occupants are of
      increased importance compared to physical distancing."

      Dr. Michael Kinzel, one of the co-authors of the study, tells SmartHER
      News a surprising finding in his research: how much variation existed in a
      classroom between “safe” vs. “unsafe” areas without ventilation – some
      areas would have very little risk and others very high. Kinzel said he
      expected a difference but did not expect such a large discrepancy.

      ## Something To Consider:


      * **So… do you need a new ventilation system?**Maybe. Kinzel says masks
      ultimately help us get closer more safely, but the right ventilation
      system can help increase capacity and speed up our return to “normal.”

      * **Why not open a window?** YES! The whole point of any ventilation is to
      prevent buildup of contaminated droplets; cooler rooms are better than
      warmer rooms since warm air (your breath) rises.

      Why did aerospace engineers run this study? Professor Kinzel has an
      expertise in fluid mechanics (think of all that goes into making an engine
      work, as liquid gas is turned into mist and combined with air to ignite)
      so the team applied their knowledge of “fluids” to respiratory droplets.
