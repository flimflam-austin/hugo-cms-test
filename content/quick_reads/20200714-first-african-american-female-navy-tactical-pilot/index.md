      ## Backstory


      * Lt j.g. Madeline Swegle graduated from the Naval Academy in 2017.

      * She completed tactical aircraft (“TACAIR”) training last week and will
      earn her “Wings of Gold” next month, recognizing her as a qualified Naval
      aviator.

      * Next, she’ll be assigned a “platform” – a tactical aircraft – to
      continue her training.

      The platforms include F-18E/F “Super Hornet" (fighter attack aircraft),
      E-18G “Growler" (an electronic attack aircraft), or F35 “Lightning” (a
      fighter aircraft). This means after successfully completing additional
      training, Swegle *could* indeed become a U.S. Navy fighter pilot.
