      #OTD in 1990 Ryan White, one of the first American children to contract
      the AIDS virus, passed away at age 18. Ryan became an advocate for those
      living with AIDS, fighting discrimination in court, incl. an effort to bar
      him from school out of fear he could spread the virus through casual
      contact (like sneezing). Congress named the largest federally funded AIDS
      program after him.
