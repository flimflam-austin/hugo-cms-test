      ## Candidates Take The Stage


      * **1960 = The first time candidates face-off on T.V.**

      * Democrat Sen. John F. Kennedy vs. sitting Republican VP Richard Nixon.

      * VP Nixon appeared shortly after a recent hospitalization and an earlier
      campaign stop, looking “green, sallow” and in need of a shave.

      * Sen. Kennedy rested earlier in the day and looked “tan and fit” like a
      “matinee idol.” He went on to win the election.

      > “Should a presidential election turn on makeup? No, but this one did.”


      Producer-director of the 1960 debate Don Hewitt, who later went on to
      found CBS's 60 Minutes. Vice Pres. Nixon refused makeup - and some,
      including Hewitt, believe it literally colored the perception of him as a
      candidate, making him appear less vibrant than his competitor.
