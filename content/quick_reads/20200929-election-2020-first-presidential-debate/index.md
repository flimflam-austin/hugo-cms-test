      <div><blockquote>“Should a presidential election turn on makeup? No, but
      this one did.”</blockquote><p>Producer-director of the 1960 debate Don
      Hewitt, who later went on to found CBS's 60 Minutes. Vice Pres. Nixon
      refused makeup - and some, including Hewitt, believe it literally colored
      the perception of him as a candidate, making him appear less vibrant than
      his competitor.</p></div>
