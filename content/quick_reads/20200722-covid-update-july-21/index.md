      <div><blockquote>“Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the
      pandemic but to end it.”</blockquote><p>Pres. Trump says a vaccine remains
      a "top priority" and two candidates are moving ahead into the final stage
      of clinical trials. The President says the median age of those who died
      from COVID-19 is now 78-years-old - about 50% of all fatalities are those
      who resided in long-term care facilities or nursing homes, and fewer than
      1% are children.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it
      gets better.”</blockquote><p>Pres. Trump noted that some areas of the
      country have made significant progress, while others - such as the Sun
      Belt - have seen concerning rises - primarily in those aged between 18 to
      35-years-old. President Trump said "nearly 7,000 National Guard and
      military medical personnel" are supporting areas where the federal
      government is particularly watching hospital capacity: Texas, California,
      Florida, and Arizona</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“I’m getting used to the mask, and the reason is — think
      about patriotism.”</blockquote><p>The President asked all Americans to use
      face masks, saying they can "potentially help." Pres. Trump said he
      "gladly" wears masks when he needs to do so, when social distancing is not
      possible. Remarking on the change in mask guidance over the last several
      months, the President said of health officials: "If they change their
      mind, that’s good enough for me."</p></div>

      <div><p>On Tuesday, Pres.Trump held the first White House COVID-19 news
      conference since April. Unlike the earlier briefings with the COVID-19
      task force, only the President spoke. He said the next economic relief
      package (phase 4) is in the works and that both sides want "to get it
      done" in order to protect workers, schools, and families.</p><p></p></div>
