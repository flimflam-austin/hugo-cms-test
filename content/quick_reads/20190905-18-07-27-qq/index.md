      changer."<br><br>Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), 84, speaking to high school
      students at a leadership summit. The joke comes just days after he tweeted
      his Google profile reported he died last year. Hatch, who is set to retire
      this year, is the 3rd oldest current Senator behind Dianne Feinstein

      significantly impact our profitability.”<br><br>Facebook CEO Mark
      Zuckerberg on the company's underwhelming quarterly results, forecasting
