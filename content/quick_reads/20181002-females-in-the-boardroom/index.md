      <p>"I’m not at all convinced it would pass legal muster. …you are saying
      you need to single out women and get them on boards. The question is can
      you make that preference &amp; will it hurt men?"<br><br>Jessica Levinson,
      Loyola Law School professor, on why the new California law may be
      vulnerable to a court challenge. Critics argue it may lead to unqualified
      candidates receiving the role, simply due to their gender. That said,
      several studies point to better company performance with females on the
      board.</p>
