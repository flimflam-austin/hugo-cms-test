      > "The most promising aspect of our new approach is that**we can prolong
      the opioid pain relief effect for many months with a single injection** of
      our new bio-pharmaceuticals. This could benefit chronic pain sufferers in
      many ways and also avoid the terrible consequences of continuous use of
      opioids."

      ## About The Study:


      * **Botox blocks nerves from communicating with muscles.**

      * When injected into the face, it prevents the facial muscles that create
      wrinkles from moving.

      * **Researchers combined botox with a natural morphine that prevents
      nerves from transmitting pain.**

      * End result is a less toxic & less addictive injectable than opioids.

      ## Why It Matters:


      * Results showed reduced pain in mice up to 23 days.

      * No clinical trials yet, though researchers are working toward that goal.

      * **Each day 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose**.

      * In October 2017, Pres. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public
      health emergency.
