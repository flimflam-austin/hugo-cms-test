Can’t they get fined for that?”</blockquote><p>Chris Willman, a music writer for Variety, who tweeted this as a joke about what he says is \"the unspoken country radio rule about not letting one female singer’s voice succeed another.\"</p></div>"

      Antebellum or Little Big Town against another female. I applaud their
      courage.”</blockquote><p>Twitter account for 98 KCQ, a radio station in
      Michigan, responding to Willman's tweet. The parent company of the station
      had to issue a public denial that such a rule existed.</p></div>

      <div><h2>What Happened?</h2><ul><li><strong>Last Week:</strong> The
      twitter storm over the decades-old industry “policy” prompted country
      stars like <strong>Kacey Musgrave &amp; Kelsea Ballerini</strong> to
      highlight the challenges of female artists breaking into country radio, or
      even being played at all.</li><li><strong>This Week:</strong> CMT (Country
      Music Television) says it will now give male &amp; female artists equal
      airtime. Other radio stations have promised “equal play.”</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>What We Know:</h2><ul><li><strong>Then:</strong> The “policy”
      employed by country music stations of not playing songs by female artists
      consecutively dates back to the 1960s. <strong>Why?</strong> One reason
      given: to spread them out because there were so
      few.</li><li><strong>Now:</strong> Songs by male country artists outnumber
      women by <strong>9.7 to 1</strong>. <strong>16% of the top 500 country
      songs</strong> from 2014-2018 were by females, according to another 2019
      study.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Based on radio airplay, audiences would presume that
      there are only a handful of women participating in the genre… But just
      like radio, where there are only a limited number of spots on a station
      playlist for female artists, there are only a limited number of spots for
      female artists on label and publishing rosters.”</blockquote><p>University
      of Ottawa researcher Jada Watson, who studies gender representation in
      country music.</p></div>

      artists for 2019: <strong>all men except</strong> #2 (Ariana

      quarter</strong> of the 600 most popular songs from 2012 to 2017 were by
      females, and women made up just <strong>12% of songwriters</strong> and
