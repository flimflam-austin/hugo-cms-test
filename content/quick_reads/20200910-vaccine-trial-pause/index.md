      # “Temporary Pause”


      One of the world’s largest vaccine trials aiming to combat COVID-19 halts
      after “an unexplained illness.”


      What To Know

      ## The Basics


      * Vaccine invented by Oxford University who partnered with a U.K.- based
      drug company, AstraZeneca.

      * Clinical trials ongoing worldwide: U.K., Brazil, South Africa & America.
      U.S. Phase III trial (final stage) began on August 31st for 30,000
      Americans.

      * Vaccine initially showed promising immune response, “no safety
      concerns”, some flu-like side effects during first trials.

    body: "## What Happened\n\nWe don’t know exactly but one participant developed an “unexplained illness.”\n\nAstraZeneca: _“In large clinical trials, illnesses will happen by chance and must be independently reviewed.”_\n\n_New York Times_\_**report**: participant developed inflammation of the spinal cord, often brought on by viral infections."

      ## How Vaccines Work


      * Not all vaccines are the same.

      * AstraZeneca vaccine uses a viral “carrier” (a common cold virus in
      chimpanzees) to deliver a small amount of SARS-COV-2 genetic material, to
      produce an immune response.

      * Moderna & Pfizer vaccines use manufactured SARS-COV-2 genetic material
      to spark an immune response (mRNA vaccine). **No mRNA vaccines have been
      approved for human use.**

      ## BIG PICTURE


      * Dozens of potential vaccines are in clinical trials *worldwide* ~ 100+
      preclinical development. **In the U.S., three vaccines are in final stage
      trials.**

      * More than one vaccine *may* eventually combat COVID-19.

      * We are witnessing a **historic race for vaccine development**, both for
      the speed of trials and the type of vaccine itself (**an approved mRNA
      vaccine would be the first of its kind**).

      We have no way of knowing *if* the participant is reacting to the vaccine
      or separately ill. While we wait for more info, this once again puts focus
      on safety/efficacy in the race to a vaccine. This vaccine was thought to
      be a front-runner. TBD as to what happens next.
