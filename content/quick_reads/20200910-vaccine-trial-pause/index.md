      <div><h2>The Basics</h2><ul><li>Vaccine invented by Oxford University who
      partnered with a U.K.- based drug company, AstraZeneca.</li><li>Clinical
      trials ongoing worldwide: U.K., Brazil, South Africa &amp; America. U.S.
      Phase III trial (final stage) began on August 31st for 30,000
      Americans.</li><li>Vaccine initially showed promising immune response, “no
      safety concerns”, some flu-like side effects during first
      trials.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>How Vaccines Work</h2><ul><li>Not all vaccines are the
      same.</li><li>AstraZeneca vaccine uses a viral “carrier” (a common cold
      virus in chimpanzees) to deliver a small amount of SARS-COV-2 genetic
      material, to produce an immune response.</li><li>Moderna &amp; Pfizer
      vaccines use manufactured SARS-COV-2 genetic material to spark an immune
      response (mRNA vaccine). <strong>No mRNA vaccines have been approved for
      human use.</strong></li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>BIG PICTURE</h2><ul><li>Dozens of potential vaccines are in
      clinical trials *worldwide* ~ 100+ preclinical development. <strong>In the
      U.S., three vaccines are in final stage trials.</strong></li><li>More than
      one vaccine *may* eventually combat COVID-19.</li><li>We are witnessing a
      <strong>historic race for vaccine development</strong>, both for the speed
      of trials and the type of vaccine itself (<strong>an approved mRNA vaccine
      would be the first of its kind</strong>).</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>We have no way of knowing *if* the participant is reacting to the
      vaccine or separately ill. While we wait for more info, this once again
      puts focus on safety/efficacy in the race to a vaccine. This vaccine was
      thought to be a front-runner. TBD as to what happens
      next.</p><p></p></div>
