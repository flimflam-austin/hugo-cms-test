      <div><h2>Why It Matters:</h2><ul><li><strong>New</strong>: Georgia's new
      election law is the first major state-level election law to pass after the
      heavily contested 2020 election. Hundreds of election bills are working
      through state houses nationwide.</li><li><strong>Notable</strong>:
      Georgia's election was particular close for both President &amp; the
      Senate, with dems winning all three elections (the first presidential
      election by a democrat in GA in 3 decades).</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>What Happened:</h2><blockquote>"We quickly began working with the
      House and Senate on further reforms to make it easier to vote and harder
      to cheat. The bill I signed into law does just that."</blockquote><p>GA
      Gov. Brian Kemp (R) on the election law created after the November 2020
      election by republicans and passed along party lines (republicans have the
      majority). The law includes many different provisions – we highlighted
      several.</p></div>

      <div><h2>ABSENTEE VOTING</h2><ul><li>Voters may request a ballot 78-11
      days before an election. Previously, they could start requesting ballots
      180 days before, and (in most counties) up until the Friday before
      Election Day.</li><li>Voters must verify their identity via their SSN or a
      # from a state-issued ID. Before, they could just sign their
      name.</li><li>The new law requires drop boxes for absentee voters to use,
      but limits the number, location &amp; hours of
      operation.</li></ul><p></p></div>

      <div><h2>EARLY VOTING</h2><ul><li>Counties are now required to offer
      in-person early voting for general elections on two Saturdays, with
      Sundays being optional. Previously, only one Saturday was
      required.</li><li>Early voting is prohibited before 7 a.m., and after 7
      p.m. Previously, counties could set their own hours.</li><li>For runoff
      elections, early voting will take place for about a week. Previously, it
      took place for 3 weeks.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>OTHER PROVISIONS</h2><ul><li>Voters who vote in-person, but
      outside their designated precinct will only have their vote counted if
      they vote after 5pm.</li><li>The legislature has more influence over the
      State Election Board, which has more power over county election officials
      and may intervene as they fit.</li><li>It's now a crime to hand out
      water/food within 150 ft of a polling station and within 25 ft of a person
      in line to vote.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“I told him exactly how I felt: that these bills were not
      only voter suppression, but they were in fact racist, and they are an
      attempt to turn back time to Jim Crow."</blockquote><p>Bishop Reginald
      Jackson leader of the African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia
      recalling his conversation with Georgia's Lt. Gov. He argues the laws will
      deter voters, especially black voters in urban neighborhoods, and harken
      back to past laws put in place to purposefully prevent black
      voters.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote><em>"There’s a real — and bipartisan — misunderstanding
      about whether making it easier or harder to vote, especially by mail, has
      a significant effect on turnout or electoral outcomes. The evidence
      suggests it does not."</em></blockquote><p>Correspondent Nate Cohn, New
      York Times, says research shows election laws don't impact voters as much
      as headlines &amp; political fights suggest. Inspired voters vote;
      uninspired voters do not.</p></div>
