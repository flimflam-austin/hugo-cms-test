      <div><blockquote>“Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please,
      man.”</blockquote><p>George Floyd. "8 minutes and 46 seconds" became a
      rallying cry for protestors, referencing the time Chauvin held his knee on
      George Floyd's neck. Notably, court documents have listed a range of times
      from 7 minutes 46 secs to *more* than 9 minutes for this interaction. The
      timing will be relevant to both sides. Video appears to show Floyd fall
      unconscious. Shortly afterwards, he is loaded into an ambulance and later
      declared dead at a local hospital.</p></div>

      <p>The trial will begin with jury selection, which is expected to go on
      for about three weeks. Next, the prosecution is slated to begin their
      arguments; the defense will respond by presenting their own arguments. The

      for this summer.</p>
