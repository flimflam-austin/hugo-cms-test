      ## May 25, 2020


      * A Minneapolis convenience store worker calls police, accusing George
      Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, of using a counterfeit $20.

      * Police respond & arrest Floyd. Police say Floyd “physically resisted
      officers.”

      * Bystander video shows Floyd on the ground, face down & handcuffed, with
      officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee on Floyd’s neck.

      George Floyd. "8 minutes and 46 seconds" became a rallying cry for
      protestors, referencing the time Chauvin held his knee on George Floyd's
      neck. Notably, court documents have listed a range of times from 7 minutes
      46 secs to *more* than 9 minutes for this interaction. The timing will be
      relevant to both sides. Video appears to show Floyd fall unconscious.
      Shortly afterwards, he is loaded into an ambulance and later declared dead
      at a local hospital.

      ## IMPORTANT CONTEXT


      Much of what we know about the events of May 25, 2020 comes from police
      and bystander videos.


      However, NONE of the videos released from various perspectives show the
      entire length of the encounter.


      We expect to learn a lot more about the details of the incident during the
      course of the upcoming trials.

    body: "## AUTOPSIES\n\n* Medical examiner ruled Floyd’s death a homicide due to “_cardiopulmonary_\__arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)._” Report lists “significant conditions” as hypertension and recent drug use but does *not* list these conditions as cause of death.\n* An autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family found his death was “_homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain.”_"

      ## LEGAL


      * Following Floyd’s death, Chauvin & three officers present at the scene
      were fired. All four were criminally charged.

      * Chauvin is charged with 2nd-degree murder and 2nd-degree manslaughter.

      * The three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting those
      crimes.

      * Last week, an appeals court ordered the judge to consider reinstating a
      3rd-degree murder charge against Chauvin; this is leading to some trial
      delays.

      ## BIG PICTURE


      * **This chapter of the story** will contrast the court of public of
      opinion vs. the legal requirements in the court of law.

      * **Both sides** will likely focus on whether Chauvin acted reasonably,
      used **excessive force**, and the exact cause and timing of Floyd’s death.

      * **Beyond The Trial**: Case described as a _“defining moment in the
      history of a nation that is grappling with a racial reckoning._”

      The trial will begin with jury selection, which is expected to go on for
      about three weeks. Next, the prosecution is slated to begin their
      arguments; the defense will respond by presenting their own arguments. The
      joint trial for the three other former MN officers charged is scheduled
      for this summer.
