      they haven’t been tested &amp; originally approved.</p><p>You may hear

They ranged in age from 18 to 88-yrs-old, more than half had preexisting conditions. <strong>ALL RECOVERED</strong> except two: an 86-yr-old died &amp; a 74-yr-old remained in ICU.</p></div>"

      cost-effective therapeutic strategy, to both avoid the spread of the
      disease and treat patients as soon as possible before severe respiratory
      irreversible complications take hold.”</blockquote><p>The research team
      emphasized the patients tested "clear" of COVID-19 (known formally as
      SARS-CoV-2) in just over a week, shortening hospital stays, and hopefully
      preventing future transmission.</p></div>

      similar to the 2003 SARS virus. After that outbreak the CDC studied a
      “relative” of hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine) that showed promise for
