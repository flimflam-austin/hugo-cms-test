      ## What’s Going On


      The FDA approved**emergency use** of the following drugs for treating
      COVID-19: c**hloroquine phosphate** &**hydroxychloroquine sulfate**.


      This allows the drugs to be used in ways in which they haven’t been tested
      & originally approved.


      You may hear about**hydroxychloroquine** used with the
      antibiotic**azithromycin**.

    body: "## What You Should Know\n\nA**small but recent\_study** in France showed some positive results of using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for patients with COVID-19.\n\nThe study examined 80 patients who received the drugs. They ranged in age from 18 to 88-yrs-old, more than half had preexisting conditions.**ALL RECOVERED** except two: an 86-yr-old died & a 74-yr-old remained in ICU."

      > “We believe other teams should urgently evaluate this cost-effective
      therapeutic strategy, to both avoid the spread of the disease and treat
      patients as soon as possible before severe respiratory irreversible
      complications take hold.”


      The research team emphasized the patients tested "clear" of COVID-19
      (known formally as SARS-CoV-2) in just over a week, shortening hospital
      stays, and hopefully preventing future transmission.

      ## Hydroxychloroquine


      First approved by FDA in 1955.


      Prescribed for malaria & autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.


      The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is very similar to the 2003 SARS virus.
      After that outbreak the CDC studied a “relative” of hydroxychloroquine
      (chloroquine) that showed promise for shortening or even preventing
      infection.

      ## Azithromycin

      Developed by a medical team in Croatia – patented in 1981.

      Common dosage often called a “**Z-Pak**.”

      Prescribed frequently in 3 or 5 day-doses.

      Often used to battle bacterial infections, like sinus and ear infections.

      ## Something To Consider


      The FDA issued a warning after a married couple ingested**chloroquine**
      phosphate, an ingredient in fish food, to prevent COVID-19; the husband
      died and the wife was hospitalized.


      Doctors have raised concerns about the use of hydroxychloroquine &
      azithromycin ~ especially in combination ~ as a rare side effect in *some
      people* can lead to cardiac arrest.

      Why would the combination of drugs work? And what's the potential side
      effects for those with COVID-19? Two big, important, and unanswered
      questions. We'll keep you posted. You can check out the French study on
      our source page.
