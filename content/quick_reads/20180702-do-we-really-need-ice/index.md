[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ronald-vitiello-ice-names-new-acting-director-amid-immigration-turmoil/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ronald-vitiello-ice-names-new-acting-director-amid-immigration-turmoil/)  
Vitiello replaces Thomas Homan, who announced in May he would be retiring and leaving his post. Vitiello’s acting role officially began Saturday.He takes over at a crucial time for the agency.  
ICE is under scrutiny as President Trump’s “zero-tolerance” policies at the southern border have led to family separations, ultimately sparking nationwide protests Saturday. In recent weeks, a small number of Democrats have even called for ICE to be abolished altogether.  
Vitiello has years of experience at the border. He became a border patrol agent in 1985, and has worked in law enforcement for more than 30 years.  
“As U.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner, Ron has more than 30 years of experience working in law enforcement and protecting our nation,” Nielsen said in a statement. “Deputy Commissioner Vitiello brings to ICE the vision and leadership needed to continue the exceptional work the agency is doing to accomplish its crucial national security and public safety missions.”In her statement, Nielsen thanked Homan, who planned to retire when former President Barack Obama left office but decided to stay until Mr. Trump found a replacement.
