      “Black Lives Matter is really Black Lives Matter Too. It is not a phrase
      that is about excluding — it’s a phrase that is about focus. We are
      focusing on black people because time and time again, we become the
      subjects of neglect.”


      Co-Founder Patrisse Cullors on whether Black Lives Matter is anti-White.

      > “We have been fighting and advocating to stop a war on black lives.”


      Co-Founder Opal Tometi in a recent interview calling "police brutality"
      the "spark point" for the Black Lives Matter movement that's expanded to
      include quality of life issues: "housing and education and health-care
      systems and the pandemic and what we are seeing there. So for us it has
      been more comprehensive than just the criminal-justice system and
      policing. It’s bigger than that."

      > “Do Black lives really matter to ‘Black Lives’ or is it just an agenda
      pushed by the Liberal Left?”


      Arizona State Rep. Walt Blackman, a Black Republican, speaking to Black
      conservative radio host James T. Harris in a series of recent interviews.
      Blackman called Black Lives Matter a "terrorist organization" that doesn't
      address "major issues in the Black communities" such as crime, the
      disproportionate rate of abortions by Black women, and low high school
      graduation rates among Black men.
