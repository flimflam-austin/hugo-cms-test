      <div><h2>BACKGROUND</h2><ul><li>Federal law requires that every state
      maintain a sex offender registry, but like all criminal laws, sex offender
      registry requirements vary by state.</li><li>State laws differ regarding
      WHO must register, how LONG they must register, &amp; the TYPE of
      information about sex offenders publicly available.</li><li>This month
      California amended its sex offender law with respect to who is
      *<strong>required*</strong> to register as a sex offender.</li></ul></div>

      offender is not more than 10 years older than the
      victim:</p><ul><li>Judges have <strong>discretion</strong> to decide
      whether an adult convicted of having <strong>any sex</strong> (vaginal,
      oral, anal) with a minor is <strong>required</strong> to
      <strong>register</strong> as a <strong>sex

      <div><blockquote>“I cannot in my mind as a mother understand how sex
      between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it
      could ever not be a registrable offense.”</blockquote><p>CA assemblywoman
      Lorena Gonzalez (D). Under the newly-amended law, no offender is
      *automatically* required to register as a sex offender *when* the victim
      is 14 or older and the offender is not more than 10 years older than the
      victim; critics say it's legalizing pedophilia.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“It’s appalling that in 2020, California continues to
      discriminate against LGBTQ people…”</blockquote><p>CA State Sen. Scott
      Wiener (D), who introduced the bill, says the previous law did not treat
      heterosexuals and homosexuals equally, forcing judges in some scenarios to
      put LGBTQ young people (for example a 19-year-old male engaging in sex
      with a 17-year-old male) on the sex offender registry. He argues the
      amended law gives judges more discretion.</p></div>

      <div><p>The nation's most populous state can serve as a bellwether for
      future state laws. CA was the first to legalize medical marijuana (1996),
      and became the second state to legalize same-sex marriage (2008). In 2016,
      the state's voters -- along w/Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada -- legalized
      recreational marijuana.</p><p></p></div>
