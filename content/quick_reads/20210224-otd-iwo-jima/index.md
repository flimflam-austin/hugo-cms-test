      ## The Battle of Iwo Jima:


      * A **critical battle** in WWII on the island of Iwo Jima: Feb. 19 – March
      26, 1945.

      * The photo was taken on Mount Suribachi; the volcano’s summit overlooks
      the entire island.

      * The Japanese used the summit to fire on U.S. forces, making it an
      important mission for the Marines to capture this specific position.

      * U.S. gained control of the summit & raised the flag to signal the
      victory.

      > “The United States Marines by their individual and collective courage
      have conquered a base which is as necessary to us in our continuing
      forward movement toward final victory as it was vital to the enemy in
      staving off ultimate defeat… Among the Americans who served on Iwo Island,
      uncommon valor was a common virtue.”

      > “Everybody cheered and it was really something because the flag from the
      [USS] Missoula was the very first to be raised on Japanese territory… We
      were very proud.”


      U.S. Navy vet Tom Price who sailed on the USS Missoula, one of many ships
      involved in the battle. A flag from the ship became the *first* raised on
      Iwo Jima. The Marine photographer who captured that image fell 50 feet
      dodging a grenade - he (and his film) survived.

      > “… speaking for myself—and yet I am sure there are many others aboard
      who feel the same—the part we played in the invasion of Iwo Jima was
      pretty small compared to the willing and simple heroism with which the
      Marines did their bloody job.”


      Naval communications officer Alan Wood in a letter reflecting on providing
      the now-iconic flag after the request reached the ship he served on for a
      larger Stars and Stripes.

      The iconic flag was raised days into the battle for Iwo Jima, but the
      island wasn't secure for another month. Nearly 7,000 Americans died in the
      fighting, including 3 of the men who hoisted the flag. You can view the
      famous flag in the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia. See
      rare footage of the flag raising on our source page.

Flag footage – fast forward to about 35 minutes for rare video footage of the flag being raised; the Marine who captured that moment was killed just 9 days after the filming.





One of the men who hoisted the flag was a Native American, Ira Hayes, from the Pima Indian Reservation in Arizona. Separately, Navajo Code Talkers played a role in Iwo Jima. Here’s more on their contribution.
