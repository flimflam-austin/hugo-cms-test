      ## Pres. Trump & Kim Jong Un Sign A Historic Blueprint for Peace


      > “The past does not have to define the future. Yesterday’s conflict does
      not have to be tomorrow’s war. And as history has proven over and over
      again, adversaries can indeed become friends…. Peace is always worth the
      effort…. Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make
      peace.”

      In 2016, Otto Warmbier was a 21-year-old American student who was arrested
      in North Korea after he was accused of stealing a political (propoganda)
      poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. When he was released by
      North Korea after nearly a year and a half in captivity, he was in a coma
      and died days later.

      The joint statement signed by Pres. Trump & Kim Jong Un is short on
      details. Pres. Trump said there wasn't enough time, but that more will be
      worked out in the future, and admitted that "if you don't get the ball
      over the goal line, it doesn't mean enough." Read it here:
