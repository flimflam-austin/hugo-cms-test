      hospital, which shall, in construction and arrangement, compare favorably
      with any institution of like character in this country or in
      Europe…”</blockquote><p>Nine months before his death, Johns Hopkins wrote
      that he envisioned his $7M fortune would fund a hospital (and research
      university) that could provide equal care to the poor and wealthy.
      Comparable to about $11B in today's money, Hopkins' gift was the largest
      charity donation in America at the time.</p></div>

      <div><p>Johns Hopkins never married, reportedly pledging never to do so

      African American children. Check out the interactive Johns Hopkins
