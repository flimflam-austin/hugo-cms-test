      > “It is my wish that the plan…shall provide for a hospital, which shall,
      in construction and arrangement, compare favorably with any institution of
      like character in this country or in Europe…”


      Nine months before his death, Johns Hopkins wrote that he envisioned his
      $7M fortune would fund a hospital (and research university) that could
      provide equal care to the poor and wealthy. Comparable to about $11B in
      today's money, Hopkins' gift was the largest charity donation in America
      at the time.

      Johns Hopkins never married, reportedly pledging never to do so after
      falling in love with a cousin as a teenager (his uncle disapproved).
      Hopkins set aside some of his fortune to also open an orphanage for
      African American children. Check out the interactive Johns Hopkins
      research models on our source page.
