      about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch’s policy to
      inform users that the database could be used for other uses.”_**

      # SLIPPERY SLOPE


      > “And even though it is easy to think of this technology as something
      that is used just to track down serial killers, if we allow the government
      to use it with no accountability or no further safeguards, then all of our
      genetic information might be at risk for being used for things we don’t
      want it to be used for."

      case. 72-year-old DeAngelo made his 1st court appearance Friday in
      Sacramento. So far, he has been charged with 8 murders, but he is
      suspected of a dozen killings, 45 rapes & 120+ burglaries.
