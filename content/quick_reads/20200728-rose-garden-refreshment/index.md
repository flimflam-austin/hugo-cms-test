      The rose remains a common presence for nearly every U.S. President at The
      White House, and the “most famous occupant” of a garden only steps from
      the Oval Office.


      The Rose Garden prepares for a “refreshment.”

      > “The very act of planting a garden involves hard work and hope in the
      possibility of a bright future.”


      First Lady Melania Trump announcing a "significant renewal" of the Rose
      Garden on July 27, 2020 to return the "iconic" location to its design
      during the Kennedy Administration. Why now? "... Improved infrastructure,
      better drainage, and a healthier environment" along with better access for
      those with disabilities and support for broadcasts.

      ## The Rose Garden


      * For decades, the area known as the Rose Garden has featured roses.

      * Inspired by European gardens during a trip overseas, Pres. Kennedy asked
      for a re-design upon his return home.

      * The excavation team found horseshoes dating back to the Civil War, and
      accidentally cut a mysterious buried cable put in place during WWII –
      which accidentally set off the national military alert (luckily nothing
      happened).

      The current Rose Garden hosted a vegetable garden or greenhouses (even one
      for roses) dating back to the mid-1850s. While the roses remain
      year-round, many flower varieties are switched with the seasons. The Rose
      Garden is managed by the National Park Service and supported through
      donations.

The last renovation or refreshment of the garden came during the Kennedy administration. The designer at the time tells the story in this way:

* _He and Mrs. Kennedy had just returned from a state visit to France, followed by stops in England and Austria. The President had noted that the White House had no garden equal in quality or attractiveness to the gardens that he had seen and in which he had been entertained in Europe. There he had recognized the importance of gardens surrounding an official residence and their appeal to the sensibilities of all people._ _He wanted to start, in the greatest haste, to remake the area near his office at the west end of the White House, known as the Rose Garden, into an area both useful and attractive._ [READ MORE HERE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/first-lady-melania-trump-announces-plans-restore-enhance-white-house-rose-garden/)
