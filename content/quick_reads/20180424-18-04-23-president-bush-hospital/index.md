      > “Certainly the fact President Bush was exposed to many others and many
      germs, may have played a role. There is some truth to the fact that
      stressors such as a death or traumatic event can impact the ability of our
      body’s immune system to fight off infection.”  
        
        
        
      Dr. Campbell to SmartHER News when asked if being exposed to so many
      people at his wife's funeral led to infection. Pres. Bush shook hands Sat,
