      # Mailing It In?

      What’s Changed &  

      Why It Matters

      ## Origins & Evolution


      * The concept of voting “**_in absentia_**” dates back to the Civil War –
      as a way for **military** members to cast ballots.

      * By the late **1800s**, states began allowing non-military voters to use
      absentee mail-in ballots with a valid excuse (ex: sick). States started
      allowing absentee voting without an excuse in the **1980s**.

      * Today **“voting by mail**” refers to both absentee voting and “universal
      vote-by-mail.”

      ## Mail-In Voting


      * Every state allows registered voters to apply for **absentee mail-in
      ballots**; 16 require a specific excuse (ex: caregiver, vacation
      scheduled).

      * 34 states & DC allow any voter to apply for **“no-excuse absentee”**
      mail-in ballot.

      * 5 states (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington) have
      “**universal vote-by-mail**” meaning they conduct all elections by mail
      and automatically send everyone a mail-in ballot.

      ## “No-Excuse Absentee”


      * The specific laws governing who can vote absentee (and how) vary by
      state.

      * Ballots are sent to registered voters’ official addresses per state
      records.

      * Voters apply for mail-in ballots during a specified time period, & must
      have their ballots postmarked by a given deadline.

      * Some states require election officials to check voters’ signatures.
      Others require mail-in ballots to be notarized.

      ## What’s Changed


      * In response to COVID-19, 4 states (CA, NJ, NV, VT) & DC are mandating
      mail-in ballots be sent to all registered voters. All three have had
      absentee voting on the books for decades.

      * While California and Vermont have consistently voted Democrat, Nevada
      may be viewed as a swing state – making both parties concerned about safe,
      secure, reliable voting.

      ## “Non-Traditional” Voting


      * “Traditional” voting has been on the decline as more states expand
      voting options in order to provide flexibility.

      * In 2016, about a quarter of presidential election votes were cast via
      mail (both absentee and universal vote-by-mail).

      * From 2008 to 2016, the share of voters who voted by mail in the
      presidential elections grew by about 4%.

      And then there's early voting... 39 states & DC allow voters to vote in
      person on designated days anywhere from 4 to 45 days before Election Day.
      Early voting has also soared recently, more than doubling from 2004 to
      2016 to about 24M. HOW WILL YOU VOTE IN NOVEMBER?
