      <div><h2>Origins &amp; Evolution</h2><ul><li>The concept of voting
      “<strong><em>in absentia</em></strong>” dates back to the Civil War – as a
      way for <strong>military</strong> members to cast ballots.</li><li>By the
      late <strong>1800s</strong>, states began allowing non-military voters to
      use absentee mail-in ballots with a valid excuse (ex: sick). States
      started allowing absentee voting without an excuse in the
      <strong>1980s</strong>.</li><li>Today <strong>“voting by mail</strong>”
      refers to both absentee voting and “universal
      vote-by-mail.”</li></ul></div>
