      <div><blockquote>“I couldn’t get to there to save her because the
      kidnappers were shooting everywhere.”</blockquote><p>Samaila Umar heard
      the gunshots from afar. He tried to reach his 15-year-old daughter (who
      wants to study medicine) and his 14-year-old niece (who loves science),
      but he was unable to locate them by the time he reached the Government
      Girls Secondary School.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Kidnapping for ransom is now the most thriving industry
      in Nigeria.”</blockquote><p>Terrorism analyst Bulama Bukarti. Recent
      kidnappings have often been blamed on "bandits" rather than terrorist
      groups - but Bukarti says the “line between Boko Haram and the bandits is
      getting more and more blurred” amid growing lawlessness in Nigeria. The
      country's president has warned local authorities against paying ransom,
      saying the policy "might boomerang disastrously," encouraging more
      crime.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Context</h2><ul><li><strong>“Bring Back Our Girls”</strong>: In
      2014, Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 school girls in
      Nigeria, igniting international outrage. While some girls escaped,
      <strong>100+ remain missing</strong>.</li><li><strong>Not Just
      Girls:</strong> 300+ boys were kidnapped in December. Dozens of boys were
      kidnapped days before this recent kidnapping of girls; some have already
      been released.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><blockquote><em>“The country, which has one of
      Africa’s strongest armies and is a strong U.S. counterterrorism ally, is
      struggling to contain multiple threats: a 10-year jihadist rebellion, and
      swelling banditry and lawlessness that have become a conflict of
      overlapping militant groups.”</em><br><br>The Wall Street
      Journal</blockquote></div>

      <p>While the Nigerian gov't (federal &amp; local) denies paying ransom,
      it's common belief that they do. Kidnapping school children is not unique
      to Nigeria – it's a problem seen elsewhere in Africa. We have more on this
      story linked in our source page.</p>
