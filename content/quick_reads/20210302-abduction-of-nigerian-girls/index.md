      ## KIDNAPPED


      > She dreams of becoming a doctor.  
        
      Her cousin wants to become a scientist.  
        
      But their fates – along with more than 300 other school girls kidnapped in
      Africa – remain unknown.

      Samaila Umar heard the gunshots from afar. He tried to reach his
      15-year-old daughter (who wants to study medicine) and his 14-year-old
      niece (who loves science), but he was unable to locate them by the time he
      reached the Government Girls Secondary School.

      Terrorism analyst Bulama Bukarti. Recent kidnappings have often been
      blamed on "bandits" rather than terrorist groups - but Bukarti says the
      “line between Boko Haram and the bandits is getting more and more blurred”
      amid growing lawlessness in Nigeria. The country's president has warned
      local authorities against paying ransom, saying the policy "might
      boomerang disastrously," encouraging more crime.

      ## Context


      * **“Bring Back Our Girls”**: In 2014, Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram
      kidnapped 276 school girls in Nigeria, igniting international outrage.
      While some girls escaped,**100+ remain missing**.

      * **Not Just Girls:** 300+ boys were kidnapped in December. Dozens of boys
      were kidnapped days before this recent kidnapping of girls; some have
      already been released.

      ## Why It Matters


      > _“The country, which has one of Africa’s strongest armies and is a
      strong U.S. counterterrorism ally, is struggling to contain multiple
      threats: a 10-year jihadist rebellion, and swelling banditry and
      lawlessness that have become a conflict of overlapping militant
      groups.”_

      While the Nigerian gov't (federal & local) denies paying ransom, it's
      common belief that they do. Kidnapping school children is not unique to
      Nigeria – it's a problem seen elsewhere in Africa. We have more on this
      story linked in our source page.
