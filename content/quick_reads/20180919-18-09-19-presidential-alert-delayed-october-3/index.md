      ## What’s Going On?


      FEMA testing a “Presidential Alert” – an announcement from the President
      for use only in the event of**national emergencies**.


      The “text test” was scheduled for THIS Thursday Sept. 20 at 2:18 p.m. EST,
      but**will instead go out on October 3rd** because FEMA says it’s focusing
      on Hurricane Florence recovery.

      ## Why Now?


      * 95% of Americans own a cell phone.

      * Congress authorized “emergency wireless alerts” to communicate with the
      public. Amber alerts for kidnapped children or tornado warnings often use
      this system.

      * You can opt out of receiving Amber Alerts but NOT for this national
      alert.

      Some argue this is a great tool for communicating with the public during
      dire times; others say it presents a risk for hacking or abuse. Either
      way, this will be the first wireless emergency alert directly from an
      American President.
