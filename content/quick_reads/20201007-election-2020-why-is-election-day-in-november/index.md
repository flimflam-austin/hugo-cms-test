      ## HISTORY


      * The Constitution allows states to choose the time for congressional
      elections, but it’s silent regarding pres. elections, leaving it up to
      Congress.

      * 1792 to 1845: Congress said presidential electors could vote within a
      34-day period before the first Wednesday in December.

      * 1845: Congress designated the Tuesday after the first Monday in November
      as the day for presidential electors to vote.

      ## WHY NOVEMBER?


      * At the time, America was largely an agrarian society, with most people
      depending on**farming** to make money and support their families.

      * November marks the end of the**fall harvest** (meaning most of the
      agricultural work was already done).

      * Early November is also the time of year when it’s still usually**warm
      enough** to travel before winter begins.

      ## WHY TUESDAY?


      * Most people lived in rural areas and needed to travel far distances in
      order to get to a polling station.

      * Tuesday was chosen because holding elections on Mondays could interfere
      with Sunday**church** attendance.

      * Congress added “_after the first Monday_” to ensure Election Day
      wouldn’t fall on Nov. 1, which is All Saints Day (a Catholic holiday).

      ## DID YOU KNOW?


      * Like Election Day, the Constitution is also silent about the
      inauguration date.

      * Most presidential inaugurations were held on March 4th until 1933, when
      Congress passed the**20th Amendment** to shorten the time period outgoing
      administrations remained in office

      * It states “_the terms of the President and the Vice President shall end
      at noon on the 20th day of January …and the terms of their successors
      shall then begin._“

      Now, more than ever, people are questioning the rules governing WHEN we
      vote, especially due to COVID-19. Some say Election Day should be a
      federal holiday to allow more people to vote, others say no because while
      more workers (ex: teachers) would get off from work, others (ex: waiters)
      would not.
