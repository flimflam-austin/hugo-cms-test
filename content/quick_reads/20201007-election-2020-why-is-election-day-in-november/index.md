      <div><h2>HISTORY</h2><ul><li>The Constitution allows states to choose the
      time for congressional elections, but it’s silent regarding pres.
      elections, leaving it up to Congress.</li><li>1792 to 1845: Congress said
      presidential electors could vote within a 34-day period before the first
      Wednesday in December.</li><li>1845: Congress designated the Tuesday after
      the first Monday in November as the day for presidential electors to
      vote.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>

      <div><h2>WHY NOVEMBER?</h2><ul><li>At the time, America was largely an
      agrarian society, with most people depending on <strong>farming</strong>
      to make money and support their families.</li><li>November marks the end
      of the <strong>fall harvest</strong> (meaning most of the agricultural
      work was already done).</li><li>Early November is also the time of year
      when it’s still usually <strong>warm enough</strong> to travel before
      winter begins.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>WHY TUESDAY?</h2><ul><li>Most people lived in rural areas and
      needed to travel far distances in order to get to a polling
      station.</li><li>Tuesday was chosen because holding elections on Mondays
      could interfere with Sunday <strong>church</strong>
      attendance.</li><li>Congress added “<em>after the first Monday</em>” to
      ensure Election Day wouldn’t fall on Nov. 1, which is All Saints Day (a
      Catholic holiday).</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>DID YOU KNOW?</h2><ul><li>Like Election Day, the Constitution is
      also silent about the inauguration date.</li><li>Most presidential
      inaugurations were held on March 4th until 1933, when Congress passed the
      <strong>20th Amendment</strong> to shorten the time period outgoing
      administrations remained in office</li><li>It states “<em>the terms of the
      President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of
      January …and the terms of their successors shall then
      begin.</em>“</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Now, more than ever, people are questioning the rules governing
      WHEN we vote, especially due to COVID-19. Some say Election Day should be
      a federal holiday to allow more people to vote, others say no because
      while more workers (ex: teachers) would get off from work, others (ex:
      waiters) would not.</p><p></p></div>
