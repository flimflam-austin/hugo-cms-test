**Chicken & Cornmeal Dumplings by Robyn in San Francisco**

*Generous 4-6 Servings

2 lbs chicken pieces, preferably bone-in, skin on

6 cups chicken stock

1 bay leaf

1 med. celery rib, sliced crosswise* This is optional. Allergic or loathe, leave it.

3-4 medium carrots, peeled, sliced on diagonal into 1-inch pieces

4 small white onions, halved lengthwise

2 large sprigs fresh thyme

1-2 cups packed coarsely chopped kale leaves

Salt & pepper to taste

**Cornmeal dumplings:**

1 cup flour

1/2 cup cornmeal

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

2/3 cup milk

Prepare stew: In a large Dutch-oven-style pot, combine the chicken pieces, stock, & bay leaf. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate, turn the chicken over & cover. Simmer for 10 minutes.  
Remove lid & skim fat off broth. Stir in the celery, carrots, onions, & thyme sprigs. Continue to simmer over moderate heat, partially covered, until the carrots & onions are just tender, approx. 15 mins. Season with salt & pepper to taste.

Prepare the dumplings: in a medium bowl, whisk all dry ingredients. With your fingers or a pastry cutter, gently work butter into flour mixture until it is crumbly. Use a fork to blend in milk.

Add the kale to the pot. Then drop the batter by tablespoons over the top of the stew. Reduce heat to moderately low, cover, & simmer until dumplings cooked through, about 10 mins. Discard bay leaf & thyme sprigs. Serve stew immediately in shallow soup bowls.

Final thoughts from Robyn: This recipe can be halved easily. You may also brown the chicken before poaching, if you prefer: Add 2 tsp of olive oil to pan. Bring to medium high heat. Salt & pepper the chicken. Place chicken pieces skin side down. Cook 5 mins per side, then follow from step 1. This recipe is so easy & comforting. I hope it becomes a family favorite. Cheers!
