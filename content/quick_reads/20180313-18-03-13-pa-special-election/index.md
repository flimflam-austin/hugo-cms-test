      <div><h2>The Disappearing District</h2><p>In January, Pennsylvania’s
      highest court ruled the state’s congressional map was an unconstitutional
      partisan gerrymander favoring Republicans, and ordered lawmakers to draw a
      new map for all of the state’s 18 congressional districts.</p><p><a
