      > “One of mama’s and I’s first dates, I climbed up a magnolia tree and I

      ## Why Is Fixer Upper SUCH A Big Deal…in TV?


      Show gained viewers as others lost.


      * Oscars lowest viewership in 40 yrs.

      * Super Bowl lowest viewers since 2009.

      * Important network morning shows all losing viewers year-over-year. In
      fact,**Fixer Upper often beat the TV giants in viewership**.

      # ‘Fixer Upper’ Success


      ## Talent & Good Timing


      * Americans expected to spend more this year on home renovations (up 7.5%
      to more than $340 B) ~ due in part to rebuilding from terrible natural
      disasters.

      * Sales on homes already built (ripe for remodel) up year-over-year.

      * Overall, healthy real estate market.
