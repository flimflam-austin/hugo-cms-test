      <div><h2>What To Know</h2><p>FDA approved first “antigen test” for
      COVID-19.</p><p>Test looks for “fragments of proteins found on or within
      the virus” (FDA).</p><p>Uses a nasal swab and machines already available
      in many doctor’s offices.</p><p>Results in 15 minutes.</p></div>

      <div><p>“…positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but
      there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not
      rule out infection.”</p><p>The FDA advises using an additional test (PCR
      test) follow negative results. PCR tests read the genetic material of the
      virus. While rapid PCR tests exist, they can be more expensive, complex
      and take longer to get results. Bottom Line: Antigen tests can quickly
      confirm positive cases - negative results need subsequent
      testing.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Context &amp; Concerns</h2><ul><li>The World Health Organization
      advised against antigen tests in <strong>early
      April</strong>.</li><li>WHO: Significant chance for false negatives: “half
      or more of COVID-19 infected patients might be missed by such tests,
      depending on the group of patients tested.”</li><li>WHO: Antigen tests
      *could be* important “triage tests” to rapidly identify patients
      <strong>likely</strong> to have COVID.</li></ul></div>

      first of many antigen tests.</p><p>Antigen tests are widely used for flu
      and strep.</p><p>However, some doctors may still want to send you to test
      site. Not all offices will be able to follow protocols required for
      administering a COVID-19 test (ex: full protective gear for each &amp;
      every test).</p></div>

      <div><p>Fmr. FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb told the Washington Post: “We
      need these kinds of tests...This is a nice complement to the overall
      testing platform in this country.” In the past, as testing availability
      increases, infection numbers *do* rise but mortality rates go down. It's
      TBD if this will happen with COVID-19.</p><p></p></div>
