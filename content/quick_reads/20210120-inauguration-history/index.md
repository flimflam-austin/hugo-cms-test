      <div><p>The presidential oath is typically recited with one hand on a
      Bible, though it is not required. John Q. Adams took his oath in 1825
      using a book of law. Pres. Theodore Roosevelt held up his hand. Pres.
      Obama used Pres. Lincoln's Bible for both inaugurations, and added Dr. MLK
      Jr's Bible for his second. Pres. Trump also used the Lincoln Bible in
      addition to his own.</p><p></p></div>
