      > “I drank beer with my friends. Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too
      many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I
      did not drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually
      assaulted anyone.”  
        
      Judge Brett Kavanaugh testifying before the Senate Judiciary Cmte. As he
      points out in his testimony, the drinking age in Maryland during his youth
      was 18; In current context "underage drinking" refers to anyone younger
      than 21.

      ## Something To Consider


      > “Underage youth who drink are more likely to carry out or be the victim
      of a physical or sexual assault after drinking than others their age who
      do not drink.”  
        
        
      National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism that states other risks
      include drinking & driving accidents, suicides and drowning.
