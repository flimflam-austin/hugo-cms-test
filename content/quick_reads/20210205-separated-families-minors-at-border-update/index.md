      <div><h2>Policy Background</h2><ul><li>During parts of 2017 and 2018, the
      Trump admin. implemented a <strong>zero-tolerance policy</strong>,
      requiring the arrest of every adult illegally entering the
      U.S.</li><li>When an adult is arrested, they cannot have a minor detained
      alongside them.</li><li>Previously, adults w/ child(ren) entering the
      country illegally could avoid arrest, either through applying for asylum
      or by getting “released” in the U.S. while awaiting legal
      proceedings.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“We’re going to work to undo the moral and national shame
      of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped
      children from the arms of their families — their mothers and fathers at
      the border — and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children
      who are still in custody and their parents.”</blockquote><p>President
      Biden on creating a task force to reunite separated families.</p></div>

      <div><h2>What To Know</h2><ul><li>In 2018, Pres. Trump ended family
      separation replacing the policy w/family detention. A federal court
      ordered the reunification of minors separated from their parent/guardian
      under the zero-tolerance policy.</li><li>The Biden admin. formally
      rescinded the zero-tolerance policy in Jan. 2021.</li><li>Approx. 11% of
      minors separated during the policy (an estimated 628 of 5,500) have yet to
      be reunited.</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>COVID Impact</h2><ul><li>March 2020: CDC &amp; DHS instituted a
      policy that automatically expelled anyone incl. minors, and those seeking
      legal protection (ex. asylum), without legal status, in response to the
      global pandemic.</li><li>A court order stopped these expulsions; just last
      week a higher court overruled that decision, allowing the expulsions to
      continue (but this doesn’t necessarily mean they *<strong>will</strong>*
      continue).</li></ul></div>

      <div><h2>Big Picture</h2><ul><li>Much of recent U.S. immigration policy
      has been created through executive action rather than Congress. As Pres.
      Biden stated, “<em>I’m not making new law. I’m eliminating bad
      policy</em>.”</li><li><strong>Big Question:</strong> With Democrats
      holding both houses of Congress, will they push for immigration reform
      and/or new immigration laws? When Republicans controlled both houses (2015
      – 2019), they couldn’t reach a consensus.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>The new interagency task force focused on reuniting families is
      one of the many immigration policy overhauls expected from the Biden
      admin. The President signed two other immigration-related executive orders
      calling for a “top-to-bottom” review of the immigration legal system. Read
      more on our source page about what typically happens to minors at the
      border.</p><p></p></div>

**MINORS AT THE BORDER**

* Some children illegally arrive in the U.S. with a parent or legal guardian; others arrive without a parent, or alone, or with someone whom law enforcement deems unsafe (such as a child trafficker, a.k.a. “coyote”).
* An “unaccompanied alien child” is defined as a minor (under 18) without lawful U.S. immigration status and no U.S. parent or legal guardian ***available*** to provide care and physical custody.

**WHAT HAPPENS TO UAC**

* The Dep’t of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehends the minor (17 & younger).
* DHS transfers UAC to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a part of Dep’t of Health & Human Services (HHS).
* As their legal status is sorted out, ORR places *most* UAC with “sponsors” (usually parents or close relatives).
* Others are placed in ORR facilities.
* ORR checks in periodically to monitor their safety and wellbeing.
