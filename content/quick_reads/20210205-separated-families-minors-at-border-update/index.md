      A development on one of the most hotly-debated policies of the recent
      past: family separation at the U.S. southern border.


      Pres. Biden issues an executive action, promising change.


      What it does  

      (and what it doesn’t).

      ## Policy Background


      * During parts of 2017 and 2018, the Trump admin. implemented a
      **zero-tolerance policy**, requiring the arrest of every adult illegally
      entering the U.S.

      * When an adult is arrested, they cannot have a minor detained alongside
      them.

      * Previously, adults w/ child(ren) entering the country illegally could
      avoid arrest, either through applying for asylum or by getting “released”
      in the U.S. while awaiting legal proceedings.

      > “We’re going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the
      previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children
      from the arms of their families — their mothers and fathers at the border
      — and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who are still
      in custody and their parents.”


      President Biden on creating a task force to reunite separated families.

      ## What To Know


      * In 2018, Pres. Trump ended family separation replacing the policy
      w/family detention. A federal court ordered the reunification of minors
      separated from their parent/guardian under the zero-tolerance policy.

      * The Biden admin. formally rescinded the zero-tolerance policy in Jan.
      2021.

      * Approx. 11% of minors separated during the policy (an estimated 628 of
      5,500) have yet to be reunited.

      ## COVID Impact


      * March 2020: CDC & DHS instituted a policy that automatically expelled
      anyone incl. minors, and those seeking legal protection (ex. asylum),
      without legal status, in response to the global pandemic.

      * A court order stopped these expulsions; just last week a higher court
      overruled that decision, allowing the expulsions to continue (but this
      doesn’t necessarily mean they ***will*** continue).

      ## Big Picture


      * Much of recent U.S. immigration policy has been created through
      executive action rather than Congress. As Pres. Biden stated, “_I’m not
      making new law. I’m eliminating bad policy_.”

      * **Big Question:** With Democrats holding both houses of Congress, will
      they push for immigration reform and/or new immigration laws? When
      Republicans controlled both houses (2015 – 2019), they couldn’t reach a
      consensus.

      The new interagency task force focused on reuniting families is one of the
      many immigration policy overhauls expected from the Biden admin. The
      President signed two other immigration-related executive orders calling
      for a “top-to-bottom” review of the immigration legal system. Read more on
      our source page about what typically happens to minors at the border.

**MINORS AT THE BORDER**

* Some children illegally arrive in the U.S. with a parent or legal guardian; others arrive without a parent, or alone, or with someone whom law enforcement deems unsafe (such as a child trafficker, a.k.a. “coyote”).
* An “unaccompanied alien child” is defined as a minor (under 18) without lawful U.S. immigration status and no U.S. parent or legal guardian ***available*** to provide care and physical custody.

**WHAT HAPPENS TO UAC**

* The Dep’t of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehends the minor (17 & younger).
* DHS transfers UAC to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a part of Dep’t of Health & Human Services (HHS).
* As their legal status is sorted out, ORR places *most* UAC with “sponsors” (usually parents or close relatives).
* Others are placed in ORR facilities.
* ORR checks in periodically to monitor their safety and wellbeing.
