      ## WHERE WE ARE


      * Each side – the House managers (Democrats) arguing for the removal of
      Pres. Trump, & Pres. Trump’s lawyers (Republicans) – have made opening
      arguments.

      * Democrats used nearly all of the 24 hours (3 days) allotted to each
      side; Republicans used about half their time (Source: C-SPAN).

      * Now senators get to submit written questions to both sides.

      ## LINGERING QUESTION


      Will the Senate allow witness testimony?


      Initially it seemed no.


      * The Republican-led Senate argues the Democrat-led House already allowed
      witness and expert testimony, leading to the impeachment of Pres. Trump.

      * Democrats argue Pres. Trump prevented testimony & evidence in the House
      and new information has come to light. Some Republicans agree.

      ## WHAT’S NEW


      * Pres. Trump’s former National Security Advisor John Bolton reportedly
      has first-hand knowledge of Pres. Trump’s decision to withhold aid from
      Ukraine and why.

      * He – reportedly – details this information in his new book.

      * We hesitate to characterize this information compared to other media
      outlets because…**no one has read the book** OR**has direct quotes from
      it**.

      > “I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my
      testimony, I am prepared to testify.”


      Amb. John Bolton in early January before reports on the contents of his
      book surfaced. Amb. Bolton says he resigned his position of National
      Security Advisor; Pres. Trump says he fired him. Consequently, the opinion
      on Bolton varies from a respected expert to disgruntled employee.

      > “While we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the congressional
      Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts and
      deranged partisan crusades.”  
        
      Pres. Trump during a rally this week in New Jersey. If the Senate allows
      witnesses, others like Joe Biden could be called to testify and the
      impeachment trial could last several more weeks or even months, keeping
      top Democrat presidential candidates (ex: Sens. Sanders, Warren) off the
      campaign trail.

      Whether or not the Senate allows witnesses depends entirely on a majority
      vote in the Senate where Republicans hold the majority. One solution? Sen.
      Lankford asked if the Senate can have classified access to Bolton's
      yet-unpublished book, "The Room Where It Happened," due for release March
      17th.
