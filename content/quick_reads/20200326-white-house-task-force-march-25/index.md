      > “…devices that anesthesiologists use for outpatient surgery can be
      converted with a change of a single vent to a very useful ventilator.”


      Vice President Mike Pence says there are tens of thousands of devices that
      can be converted to help struggling communities. Dr. Birx added that since
      elective surgeries have been postponed, devices (& anesthesiologists who
      know how to use them) may be reallocated to help areas in need.

      to people.”


      Dr. Deborah Birx addressing some of the estimates of those potentially
      ravaged by COVID-19. She emphasized attention-grabbing theoretical models
      often look at an outbreak's course spanning several "cycles" without any
      widespread public health preventative measures, and that "we know that
      every American is doing something."

      Pres. Trump responding to a question about whether he would want to test
      every single American in order to isolate those infected - the President
      said tests should be administered state-to-state to determine a course of
      action. Members of the Task Force emphasized the need to get more detailed
      data from locales to determine needs. Today more than half of the new and
      established U.S. cases are in four counties in the New York metropolitan
      area.

      see, as they’re relaxing the constraints on travel, that they’re getting
      imported cases.”


      Dr. Anthony Fauci said a conference call with the World Health
      Organization revealed a warning about releasing constraints to help
      prevent the spread of COVID-19 too early. The federal gov't campaign - "15
      days to Slow the Spread" - ends Monday. Next steps remain TBD.

      Dr. Birx says the number of new cases per day in the New York City has
      been "relatively constant" over the last 3 days, showing the importance of
      public health measures. Officials want to see constant or lower numbers as
      a sign public health measures *may* be working.
