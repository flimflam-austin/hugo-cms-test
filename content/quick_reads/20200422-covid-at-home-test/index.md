      ## Why It Matters:


      * **More Data**: More tests = more information to guide our next steps.

      * **Saves Gear**: At-home tests will save time and equipment, both on
      short supply. Healthcare workers have to administer COVID-19 tests in full
      protective gear (even though the majority of people tested nationwide test
      negative for COVID-19).

      * **Transmission**: If you**are** sick, this test keeps you away from
      other people.

      ## What To Know:


      * First at-home test approved for COVID-19 in America.

      * LabCorp developed it. It costs $119.

      * **You can’t just go buy it:** A doctor must approve it for you.

      * **Not available everywher**e: Not all states allow at-home testing,
      including the hardest hit states of NY & NJ.

      * **Not available for everyone:** Healthcare workers, first responders
      will receive priority.

      ## How It Works:


      * After a physician places an order, a kit will arrive in the mail at your
      home.

      * The kit comes with everything you need, the most important component? A
      specific nasal swab.

      * You collect your own sample by swabbing the inside of your nose and mail
      it back to LabCorp with the box provided.

      * FDA says it’s as “safe & accurate” as testing at hospitals, doctors
      offices, etc.

      To date, the FDA has authorized more than 50 COVID-19 diagnostic tests and
      4 antibody (aka serological) tests. Pres. Trump is using the Defense
      Production Act to manufacture 20M swabs a month for tests. Interesting to
      note: the FDA says it's investigating using q-tip style swabs for testing.
