      tests = more information to guide our next steps.</li><li><strong>Saves
      Gear</strong>: At-home tests will save time and equipment, both on short
      supply. Healthcare workers have to administer COVID-19 tests in full
      protective gear (even though the majority of people tested nationwide test
      negative for COVID-19).</li><li><strong>Transmission</strong>: If you
      <strong>are</strong> sick, this test keeps you away from other
      people.</li></ul></div>
