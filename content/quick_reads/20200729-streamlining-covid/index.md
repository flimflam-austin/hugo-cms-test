      ## Do You Have COVID?


      Researchers want to streamline categorizing your symptoms and try to
      predict your outcome.


      New study reveals their current findings.

      ## Backstory


      * The list of symptoms for COVID-19 has evolved, including common
      ailments.

      * Researchers at King’s College used a database of 4M people from a
      “symptom tracker app” to identify symptoms, and grouped symptoms found in
      a subset of 1600 people.

      * They identified 6 separate categories of COVID-19 symptoms, and then
      attempted to associate these categories to potential severity of disease.

      ## The 6 Categories

      1. Flu-like with no fever

      2. Flu-like with fever

      3. Gastrointestinal

      4. Severe level 1, fatigue

      5. Severe level 2, confusion

      6. Severe level 3, abdominal and respiratory

      ## Potential “Early Warning”?


      * First three categories had lower rates of severe cases, hospitalization.

      * Researchers used symptoms experienced on Day 5 of infection &
      factored-in other variables (e.g. age, weight) to assign patients a
      category.

      * Since hospitalization often occurs more than a week into a COVID-19
      infection, researchers want to create a model to help predict a more
      serious case and enable doctors to intervene early.

      > “Certainly, we will have to see how this performs in the ‘real world.’
      With widespread use, it should ‘learn’ and become progressively more
      effective.”


      UC Berkeley professor of infectious disease and vaccinology Dr. John
      Swartzberg, who did not work on the study but says it could start helping
      doctors with care plans.

      study is not "peer reviewed" - an important step that helps validate
      medical research. In the midst of the pandemic, many studies released to
      the public have not been peer reviewed as scientists have scrambled to
      understand this new illness.
