      ## Apple’s Trillion Dollar Day


      From its humble start in a California garage to now the FIRST & MOST
      valuable company ever at  

      $1,000,000,000,000.


      Why some say the focus on the $$$$ may miss the point of the company’s
      true value.

      ## iPhone Center Stage


      * **Apple now worth more than all but 26 countries in the world.A**

      * **Why?** Better than expected iPhone sales in its latest earnings report
      pushed the stock higher.

      * Stock price impacts the worth of the company or “market cap.”

      * Apple “beat” expectations, but some analysts lowered #’s wks ago because
      of concerns re: iPhone sales.

      ## Why $1T Ain’t Everything


      > ‘The fact that you have a billion and a half people with Apple devices
      around the world in a sense gives them a user base that if they can figure
      out other ways to make money off that user base.”  
        
      NYU professorA Aswath Damodaran to CNBC, pointing out that even if Apple's
      iPhone sales slow now, its CURRENT customer base has great value.
