      <blockquote>“Before I leave I’d like to see our politics begin to return
      to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the
      history of other nations. I would like to see us recover our sense that we
      are more alike than different.’<br><br>Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) on his
      goals for his last term in office in an excerpt from his forthcoming book,
      ‘The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other

      <p><strong>“It’s not about our salaries. Most teachers I know, they try to
      get by, they live paycheck to paycheck. … we work ourselves to the bone
      trying to do it because it matters.”</strong><br><br>Stacy Masciangelo, an
      AZ high school teacher, to ABC News on Sunday about why she is striking
      alongside thousands of other educators in Arizona &amp; Colorado. Like
      their counterparts in Oklahoma, West Virginia, &amp; Kentucky, the AZ
      &amp; CO educators want improved facilities, more funding &amp; higher
      wages.</p>
