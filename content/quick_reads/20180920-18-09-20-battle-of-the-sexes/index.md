      # Battle of the Sexes


      Riggs (55), a tennis champion and self-proclaimed male chauvinist,
      challenged King (29) a year earlier.


      After the match, Riggs saidA “**Billie Jean was just too strong for me.
      She was too quick in the exchanges. I thought I had her out of court many
      times but she made the shots.**“

      ## Why King Matters


      In 1971, King was the first female athlete to win over 100K in prizes.


      In 1972, Congress passed Title IX, banning gender discrimination in school
      programs (including sports) that receive federal fund$.


      After her victory against Riggs, King said “**I thought it would set us
      back 50 years if I didn’t win that match**.”

      King recently sat down for her first television interview since Serena
      Williams alleged sexism at the US Open. King said sexism still exists in
      tennis, but that "crisis creates opportunity" and this is an opportunity
      to get things right.
