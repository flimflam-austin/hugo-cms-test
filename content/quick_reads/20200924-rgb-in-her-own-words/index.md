      <div><blockquote>“One lives not just for oneself, but for one’s
      community.”</blockquote><p>Justice Ginsburg on how she defines a
      meaningful life. She graduated top of her class from Columbia Law School
      in 1959. She began working with the American Civil Liberties Union in the
      1960s, and by 1971, she founded their Women’s Rights Project. She was
      appointed as federal judge in 1980 by Pres. Carter and joined the nation's
      highest court in 1993 after she was nominated by Pres. Clinton.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The attitude is ‘I’m going to surmount this – whatever
      it is.’”</blockquote><p>Justice Ginsburg on how she approached adversity
      in her career, as a mother, and in her battles with cancer. Her
      perseverance, even in defeat, evoked change. In 2006, the Court ruled
      against a woman paid less than her male counterparts that sued for
      discrimination because she missed a deadline. In her dissent, she wrote
      that the Court failed to comprehend "the insidious way that women can be
      victims to discrimination." A 2009 federal law overturned the
      decision.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“I had a life partner who thought my work was as
      important as his, and I think that made all the difference for
      me.”</blockquote><p>Justice Ginsburg on her late husband and "best friend"
      Marty, who died in 2010. They met while attending Cornell University and
      went on to have two children, Jane &amp; James. She credited her
      supportive husband with helping her reach potential and often cited the
      following advice given to her by her mother-in-law: "in every good
      marriage, it pays sometimes to be a little deaf.”</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“The judiciary – unlike the legislature, unlike the
      president – is a reactive institution. We have no agenda. We respond to
      the cases that are out there. Courts don’t initiate change. People
      do.”</blockquote><p>Justice Ginsburg when asked how the Court contributed
      to the push for equal rights for women. She explained it's not the Court's
      role to *initiate* change but to trail behind society and respond to the
      people's will for changes by putting its "stamp of approval" on change
      already underway.</p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“I think the notion that we have all the democracy that
      money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to
      be.”</blockquote><p>Justice Ginsburg on the one decision by the Court she
      would want to overrule. In 2010, the Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC
      that the First Amendment prohibits the federal government from imposing
      limits on political spending by corporations and unions, allowing
      unlimited campaign ad spending.</p></div>

      <div><p>“Someone who used whatever talent she had to do her work to the
      very best of her ability. And to help repair tears in her society, to make
      things a little better through the use of whatever ability she
      has.”<br><br>Justice Ginsburg on how she wants to be remembered. She later
      said she wants to be remembered in 100 years as "a judge who worked as
      hard as she could to the best of her ability to do the job
      right.”</p><p><br></p></div>
