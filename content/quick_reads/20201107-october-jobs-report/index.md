      <div><h2>The Basics:</h2><p>Last month the U.S. gained <strong>638,000
      jobs.</strong></p><p>This is better than expected (especially since more
      than 150,000 census workers lost their temporary jobs).</p><p>The new
      unemployment rate is <strong>6.9% – a full percentage point lower than
      September</strong>, but the nation still has <strong>10M fewer jobs than
      before the pandemic.</strong></p></div>

      <div><blockquote>“It was a pleasant surprise to see that the pace of the
      recovery hasn’t slowed down. But we all need to keep in mind the huge hole
      that we’re in, in terms of jobs and
      unemployment.”</blockquote><p>Economist Nick Bunker at Indeed, the job
      search website. While the economy added jobs, gains in October were lower
      than September and August. Concerns remain about the pace of job recovery
      and strength of seasonal hiring.</p></div>

      <div><h2>Something to Consider</h2><ul><li><strong>Quantity vs.
      Quality:</strong> While hiring appears strong, questions remain about
      earning power. For example – if a waiter was rehired, are they making the
      same amount in tips vs. pre-COVID?</li><li><strong>Need vs. Want:</strong>
      What is the impact of the record number of women leaving the labor force
      during the COVID-19 pandemic? She may <strong>want</strong> to work, but
      is no longer counted as part of the labor force if she
      <strong>needs</strong> to stay home.</li></ul></div>

      <div><p>Whoever wins the presidency will confront an economy hurt by the
      global pandemic. Different opinions exist about the role of government to
      stimulate an economy - with some proposing massive spending and others
      wary of it.</p><p></p></div>
