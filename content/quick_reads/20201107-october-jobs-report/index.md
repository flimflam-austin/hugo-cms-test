      # “Surprising Burst of Strength”

      Better than expected, but not back to normal.

      ## The Basics:


      Last month the U.S. gained **638,000 jobs.**


      This is better than expected (especially since more than 150,000 census
      workers lost their temporary jobs).


      The new unemployment rate is **6.9% – a full percentage point lower than
      September**, but the nation still has **10M fewer jobs than before the
      pandemic.**

      > “It was a pleasant surprise to see that the pace of the recovery hasn’t
      slowed down. But we all need to keep in mind the huge hole that we’re in,
      in terms of jobs and unemployment.”


      Economist Nick Bunker at Indeed, the job search website. While the economy
      added jobs, gains in October were lower than September and August.
      Concerns remain about the pace of job recovery and strength of seasonal
      hiring.

      ## Something to Consider


      * **Quantity vs. Quality:** While hiring appears strong, questions remain
      about earning power. For example – if a waiter was rehired, are they
      making the same amount in tips vs. pre-COVID?

      * **Need vs. Want:** What is the impact of the record number of women
      leaving the labor force during the COVID-19 pandemic? She may **want** to
      work, but is no longer counted as part of the labor force if she **needs**
      to stay home.

      Whoever wins the presidency will confront an economy hurt by the global
      pandemic. Different opinions exist about the role of government to
      stimulate an economy - with some proposing massive spending and others
      wary of it.
