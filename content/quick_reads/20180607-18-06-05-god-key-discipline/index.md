      <div><h2>The Findings:</h2><ul><li>Catholic school students are
      <strong>less disruptive</strong>, exhibited <strong>more
      self-control</strong> and <strong>respect</strong> than public AND private
      school students.</li><li>One Disclaimer: <em>“Families who send their
      children to Catholic schools make a conscious choice to do so, they likely
      differ from other families in unobservable
      ways.”</em></li></ul><p></p><p>Why This Matters</p></div>

      <blockquote>“Perhaps students are more likely to internalize such values
      when they know <strong>they are loved not only by their teachers but by
      their Creator,</strong> or when they perceive that misbehavior may have
      <strong>eternal consequences</strong>. Maybe it’s something else
      entirely.”<br><br><br>Self-Discipline and Catholic Schools</blockquote>

T_hat doesn”t mean that such secular approaches—and schools—don”t have their place. Of course they do. And so do character education, ethics classes, and civics, all of which can contribute to the development of self-discipline. School leaders should choose the options that best suit their kids and culture._  
_That said, our results suggest that Catholic schools in particular are doing something meaningful in the realm of self-discipline. So it”s deeply unfair that the politics of education continue to prevent many parents from accessing them, and it”s a tragedy for the nation that many of these valuable educational institutions continue to close. To the extent that school choice programs can widen access to great schools—Catholic or otherwise—that boost academic performance and self-discipline, they deserve our eternal support._
