      # COVID “Cocooning”


      As COVID case numbers trend higher, a *new* social mitigation strategy
      presents another *potential* option to severe lockdowns.

      ## What Is Cocooning?


      * A term for prioritizing & shielding vulnerable populations most
      susceptible to severe cases of COVID-19, such as nursing home residents.

      * Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to social mitigation, the
      strategy suggests**doubling-down protection efforts for those most
      vulnerable**.

      * Those cocooning would follow strict social distancing measures,
      essentially self-isolate, work from home, etc.

      > “Leaky cocooning can substantially undermine containment.”


      Research published by The University of Texas at Austin and Northwestern
      University this summer presented a strategy that includes cocooning as
      part of a way to "toggle" between enforcing and relaxing stay-at-home
      orders, as long as strict adherence for those "cocooned" takes place.

      While COVID cases climb in certain states, the national average of new
      daily cases currently hovers at 50,000. In July, it topped 66,000.
      Researchers on cocooning aren't saying we'd never have to lockdown again
      but argue cocooning could reduce the length and severity of other
      mitigation measures during infection spikes.
