      <div><h2>What Is Cocooning?</h2><ul><li>A term for prioritizing &amp;
      shielding vulnerable populations most susceptible to severe cases of
      COVID-19, such as nursing home residents.</li><li>Instead of a
      one-size-fits-all approach to social mitigation, the strategy suggests
      <strong>doubling-down protection efforts for those most
      vulnerable</strong>.</li><li>Those cocooning would follow strict social
      distancing measures, essentially self-isolate, work from home,
      etc.</li></ul></div>

      <div><blockquote>“Leaky cocooning can substantially undermine
      containment.”</blockquote><p>Research published by The University of Texas
      at Austin and Northwestern University this summer presented a strategy
      that includes cocooning as part of a way to "toggle" between enforcing and
      relaxing stay-at-home orders, as long as strict adherence for those
      "cocooned" takes place.</p></div>

      <div><p>While COVID cases climb in certain states, the national average of
      new daily cases currently hovers at 50,000. In July, it topped 66,000.
      Researchers on cocooning aren't saying we'd never have to lockdown again
      but argue cocooning could reduce the length and severity of other
      mitigation measures during infection spikes.</p><p></p></div>
