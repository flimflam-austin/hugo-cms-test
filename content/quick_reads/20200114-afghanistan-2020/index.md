      <div><h2>Something To Consider</h2><blockquote>“The Taliban has publicly
      stated its goals of the so-called ‘peace talks’ is the <strong>complete
      withdrawal of US forces</strong> and the re-establishment of the Islamic
      Emirate of Afghanistan, the official name of the Taliban’s
      government.”<br><br>Bill Roggio, Long War Journal editor. Reports have
      indicated peace talks were set to resume between the U.S. &amp; Taliban
      this week overseas.</blockquote></div>

      <div><h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Although not designated a terrorist group
      by the U.S. gov’t (an area of great debate) the Taliban provide safe haven
      to terrorist groups that have attacked America, most notably the 9/11
      attackers.</p><p>The Taliban and Al-Qaeda remain longtime allies. Concerns
      remain that Afghanistan, left to the Taliban, will once again become a
      breeding ground &amp; launching pad for terror.</p></div>

      <div><p>Pres. Trump cancelled talks with the Taliban in September after
      the group claimed to have killed a U.S. soldier. In November, during a
      Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan's Bagram Airfield, the President opened
      the door for restarting peace talks. The base was attacked by the Taliban
      weeks later.</p><p></p></div>
