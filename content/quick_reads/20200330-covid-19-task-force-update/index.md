      Dr. Deborah Birx explaining how the Task Force develops its
      recommendations. One model showed an estimate of more than 2.2 million
      deaths if America did NOT put public health measures in place. Another
      model noted by Birx, considers that WITH public health measures, est.
      deaths will top 81,000+. For context, the number of flu deaths estimated
      so far this year is 24,000.

      > Dr. Anthony Fauci on the complex scientific estimates he uses to help
      inform policies. Dr. Fauci said "instead of getting overly anxious about
      the extremes" or worst case scenarios that models have to consider, he
      aims to use the models to inspire policies that accomplish results better
      than the predictions.
