      * 20% heart disease = a mystery.

      * Study examined marriage as a factor by looking at data from previous
      studies.

      ## Why Marriage?


      Results same for married vs single, divorced OR widowed.


      * Security: Married people may seek medical help sooner (they have someone
      around to nag them to go to the doctors OR to see changes in behavior).

      * Economic: Couples may have better joint income & therefore, better
      healthcare.
