      <div><h2>Why It Matters</h2><ul><li>More production at home makes the U.S.
      less reliant on volatile Middle East, creating more jobs for production
      &amp; distribution.</li><li>Also important to remember: <strong>Oil is a
      global market.</strong> If Saudi Arabia or Russia ramped up production
      dramatically, it could drive prices lower – potentially to a point that
      would make extracting oil from shale not worth it
      financially.</li></ul></div>
