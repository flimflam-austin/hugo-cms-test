      ## Talc-Based Baby Powder

      * Asbestos, also a naturally-occurring mineral, is often found near & can
      contaminate talc mining sites.

      * Crushed talc is in many personal care products, like makeup, deodorant,
      and one formula of Johnson’s Baby Powder.

      * Concerns about talc &**asbestos** cross-contamination began in the
      1930s.

      * Questions about links between talc and ovarian cancer date back to the
      1960s.

      ## Is Talc Dangerous?


      * A World Health Org. agency: talc containing asbestos is “carcinogenic”
      (potential to cause cancer) when inhaled.

      * American Cancer Society: studies have been mixed, but notes “some
      suggestion of a possible increase in ovarian cancer risk.”

      * FDA: no studies have proven a conclusive link between talc and ovarian
      cancer.

      > “Demand for talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder in North America has been
      declining due in large part to changes in consumer habits and fueled by
      misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of
      litigation advertising.”


      J&J in a statement, noting it remains "remains steadfastly confident" in
      the safety of its product, citing "decades of scientific studies by
      medical experts around the world."

      > “Today’s victory means that children and families no longer will be
      endangered by this baby powder.”


      Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), the Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic
      and Consumer Policy, led a 14-month investigation into the health risks of
      asbestos in talc-containing products & said J&J "knew for decades that its
      product contains asbestos, and the company fought to keep using a testing
      method that never would have allowed it to be detected."

      Not Just The Powder: Johnson & Johnson says it decided to cut 100
      products, including talc-based baby powder, after assessing its product
      line in light of COVID-19. J&J will continue to sell its cornstarch-based
      powder, but will keep the talc-based product on market shelves until it is
      sold out. Will you continue using it?
