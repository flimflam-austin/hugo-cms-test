The [DOJ](https://www.c-span.org/video/?511118-1/attorney-general-garland-announces-investigation-minneapolis-police-department-practices)'s investigation will examine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing, including issues like excessive force, discriminatory conduct, and how police treat those with behavior health disabilities.

* The comprehensive review will look beyond specific instances, such as the death of George Floyd, and look into the police department's policies, procedures, training, use of force investigations, and internal mechanisms, as well seek input from officers and the community, to see whether there are systematic problems that can be remedied.
* If the DOJ concludes there is a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing, it will publish a report detailing its findings. If that's the case, typically the police department will enter into a civil consent decree or settlement agreement aimed at reforming its policing practices.
* The DOJ's probe into the Minneapolis Police Department is one of [at least four pattern or practice investigations](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ag-garland-announce-federal-probe-policing-practices-minneapolis/story?id=77213763) currently underway, and is entirely separate from the federal criminal investigation into whether George Floyd's civil rights were violated.
