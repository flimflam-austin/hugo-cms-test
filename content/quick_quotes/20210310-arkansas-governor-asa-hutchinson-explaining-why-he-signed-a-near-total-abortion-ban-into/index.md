As [explained](https://portal.arkansas.gov/agency/governors-office/news/governor-hutchinson-issues-statement-on-signing-of-sb/) by the Republican governor, the ban prohibits abortions in all circumstances “_except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergen_cy” and does not include any exceptions for rape or incest.

* Gov. Hutchinson [said](https://portal.arkansas.gov/agency/governors-office/news/governor-hutchinson-issues-statement-on-signing-of-sb/) _“I would have preferred the legislation to include the exceptions for rape and incest, which has been my consistent view, and such exceptions would increase the chances for a review by the U.S. Supreme Court_.”
* As noted by the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-arkansas-legislation-courts-asa-hutchinson-24ca79cb9b416f81d9152f54881c7a74), “Arkansas is one of at least 14 states where legislators have proposed outright abortion bans this year.”
* **BIG PICTURE:** In recent years, several states have passed sweeping abortion laws knowing they’ll face legal challenges in hopes that one of those lawsuits will reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has had conservative majority since 2018, and that the court will overturn or change existing abortion laws.
