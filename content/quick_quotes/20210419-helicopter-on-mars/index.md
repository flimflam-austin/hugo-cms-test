    We don’t know exactly where Ingenuity will lead us, but today’s results
    indicate the sky – at least on Mars – may not be the limit.

    NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk after a little helicopter, Ingenuity,
    survived its first flight on Mars.

* The helicopter, Ingenuity, flew for less than a minute (10 feet off the ground)...before turning around,  taking a photo and landing on Mars' surface in the wee hours of Monday morning. 
* Ingenuity had no help from teams on Earth during its first flight. In fact, NASA scientists had to wait for hours for word to reach them confirming its landing. 
* The Martian airfield the Ingenuity flew over was named in honor of aviation pioneers, the Wright Brothers. 
* "Mars is hard not only when you land, but when you try to take off from it and fly around, too. It has significantly less gravity, but less than 1% the pressure of (Earth's) atmosphere at its surface. Put those things together, and you have a vehicle that demands every input be right," Ingenuity Project Manager, MiMi Aung. 
* **What's next? **Ingenuity,** **which arrived on Mars attached to the Perseverance spacecraft, could fly four more times in coming weeks. Perseverance will continue to serve as a liaison between the helicopter and NASA researchers by collecting photos, videos and data. 

Why It Matters: NASA engineers say Ingenuity's success opens new doors for space exploration. It is the first aircraft to take an entire flight beyond Earth.
