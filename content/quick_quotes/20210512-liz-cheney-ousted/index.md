    Congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) in her remarks after being removed from
    her leadership position by her fellow Republican lawmakers.

* Congresswoman Cheney's leadership position was the third highest among the House Republicans, behind only  the House Majority Whip (Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca) and House Minority Whip (Congressman Steve Scalise (R-La). 
* The Conference Chair helps communicate a party's unified message or stance on policy issues or legislation.
* Congresswoman Cheney fell out of step with other leaders in the party over her criticism of former President Donald Trump; She was one of 10 Republicans to vote for his impeachment in 2021; see her full statement on the [impeachment vote here. ](https://cheney.house.gov/2021/01/12/cheney-i-will-vote-to-impeach-the-president/)
* Congresswoman Cheney referred to President Trump's assertion that the 2020 election was stolen as "The Big Lie." [Here's a recent tweet where she uses that term](https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1389225154639695881?s=20): _"The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system."_
* Within her own party, she had both supporters and opposition: 
  * Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Oh): _“You can’t have a conference chair who recites Democrat talking points.”_
  * Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.): _"I stand with Liz. I’m proud of her. There’s a lot of people who are proud of her for what she’s done and a lot of people who feel threatened by her.”_
* **Context:**  Immediately following the election, House Republicans voted on whether Congresswoman Cheney should stay in her leadership role - She survived that vote in February, but not months later.
* **What's Next: **The House GOP is expected to vote within a week on a replacement.

**BIG PICTURE: **Political analysts speculate how much former President Trump (his past term in office and his influence moving forward) will define the Republican party.
