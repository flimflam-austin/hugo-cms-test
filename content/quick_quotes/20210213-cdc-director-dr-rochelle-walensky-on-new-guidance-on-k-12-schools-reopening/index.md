In new specific guidelines, the CDC made the case for schools reopening during the pandemic.

* The CDC cannot force schools to reopen, neither can the federal government.
* The CDC says recent studies show that schools are not a major source of COVID-19 spread in America, and that strict adherence to guidelines like masking, social distancing will enable schools to reopen.
* While studies by the CDC show certain guidelines may help mitigate the spread of COVID in schools, [other research (like this one linked) show that proactively testing students reveals cases that may not have been identified.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250065v1)
* The CDC [does not recommend teachers receive vaccines](https://apnews.com/article/cdc-in-person-schooling-4265da944bb3b6c863db6ca6a03caa58) before others as a prerequisite for reopening.
* Why It Matters: [Many schools, including some in the nation’s largest districts, remain remote](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening/#:~:text=As%20of%20Sept.,in%20fully%20remote%20learning%20mode.). This has raised questions about [the impact of virtual classes on students](https://time.com/5918769/coronavirus-schools-learning-loss/) as well as the impact in the labor market (as some unemployment data correlate to those – [mostly women](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/19/economy/women-quitting-work-child-care/index.html) – who had to exit the workforce to stay home with their kids).
