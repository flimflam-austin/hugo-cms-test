    There was no guarantee that the vaccines were going to perform the same in
    the real world...

    CDC study lead author on the latest research showing the Pfizer and Moderna
    vaccines are 80% effective two weeks after the first dose and 90% effective
    two weeks after the second dose.

**BACKGROUND:** Both vaccines use mRNA technology. Unlike traditional vaccines, which use a small amount of actual virus to spark an immune response, mRNA vaccines do not. Instead they deliver a “blueprint” to our cells on how to produce a non-infectious viral protein. Like a factory, our bodies produce this viral protein, identify it as an “intruder” and build immunity against it.

  * The Pfizer vaccine is a two-dose vaccine given 21 days apart, which must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. The Moderna vaccine is a two-dose vaccine given 28 days apart, which can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.
  * The data submitted from the controlled trials to the FDA in 2020 showed both vaccines were approximately 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 after two doses.

* **LATEST:** The [study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm) published by the CDC provides the first look at how effective the vaccines are in real-world conditions among those considered the greatest at risk. Researchers followed nearly 4,000 first responders, health care and other frontline workers who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for three-months from December to March. The participants were tested weekly for COVID.
* **BIG PICTURE:** The study’s results shows that both the Modern and Pfizer vaccines are *nearly* as effective as they were believed to be based on the 2020 randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trials. The CDC says **“_authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in real-world conditions._“**
