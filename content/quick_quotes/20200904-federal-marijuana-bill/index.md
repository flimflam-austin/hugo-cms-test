* **ABOUT:** The [House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884) bill would (1) remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances, (2) authorize a sales tax on marijuana products, and (3) allow for federal courts to expunge prior marijuana convictions.
  * The House bill is technically “bipartisan” because one of its 93 cosponsors is Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz.
  * The companion bill in the [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2227) was introduced in July 2019 by now Democratic VP candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).
* **BIG PICTURE:** Today, medical marijuana is legal in all but 17 states. 11 states and DC have legalized recreational marijuana, and 16 states have decriminalized possession of small amounts, according to the [National Conference of State Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/clearing-criminal-records-for-cannabis-offenses.aspx).
* **WHAT’S NEXT:** Rep. Nadler told [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/04/marijuana-house-vote-federal-legalization-first-time/5678068002/) that the bill will likely receive unanimous support in the Democrat-controlled House when it votes later this month, but its fate in Republican-controlled Senate appears far less certain, with one Republican spokesperson telling [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/04/marijuana-house-vote-federal-legalization-first-time/5678068002/) there’s “no plan” to move ahead on the bill.
