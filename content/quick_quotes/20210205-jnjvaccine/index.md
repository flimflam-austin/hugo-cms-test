* If approved, the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine would be the first single-dose COVID-19 vaccine available. Health officials say this will streamline the vaccination process by improving access to people in rural areas and developing countries.
* The [data](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial), based on an ongoing study with nearly 44,000 participants in the U.S. and seven other countries, suggests it is “**66% effective overall in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination.**”
  * 72% effective in the U.S.
  * 57% in South Africa (where one of the new mutant strains is most prevalent).
* The J&J vaccine usess the same technology as the recently approved Ebola vaccine, which is different than the mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. In some ways, it’s a more “traditional” vaccine. It uses a cold virus, modified so it cannot cause illness, to encourage the body to make harmless copies of a protein that fortifies the immune system to prepare it for if and when SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) enters.
  * Learn more about how the J&J vaccine works [HERE](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html)
* *UPDATE* On February 4, J&J file an application for emergency use authorization in the U.S., with the hope of providing 100 million doses in the U.S. by June and a billion worldwide by the end of the year.
* **Why it matters**: The single-dose vaccine offers hope in speeding up the vaccination process, especially in locations that lack the infrastructure to coordinate two doses for each person.
  * Dr. Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer at Johnson & Johnson, said in a release. “_A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings, enhancing access, distribution and compliance._”
