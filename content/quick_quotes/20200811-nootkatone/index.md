* Nootkatone is found in grapefruit and contributes to both its smell and taste.
* It was discovered and developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and has been used for many years in fragrances and flavoring.
* Now it’s registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) meaning that it can be used as the active ingredient in bug repellents and insecticides as soon as 2022.
* The CDC said that “providing new alternatives to existing bite-prevention methods paves the way to solving one of biggest challenges in preventing vector-borne diseases—preventing bites.” ([vector-borne diseas](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases)e = disease like malaria – “human disease caused by parasites”).
* **Why It Matters:** Illnesses from mosquito and ticks doubled in the U.S. from 2004 to 2018, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0810-nootkatone-registered-epa.html). In many parts of America, mosquitoes have become resistant to existing pesticides and the EPA hopes nootkatone will help prevent mosquito borne diseases, like Zika and West Nile.
