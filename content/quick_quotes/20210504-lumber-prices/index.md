* Lumber prices have quadrupled. Here's an anecdote from Hineman: _"We typically are used to seeing it around $10-$12, as low as $9 per sheet. It's selling for $43 per sheet right now."_
* Costs have risen because of low supply.  Sawmills closed during the COVID-19 shutdown causing a shortage at the same time there's high demand for building materials. 
* **Why does it matter?** The higher building costs combined with a shortage of housing inventory pushes home prices higher. One estimate says higher lumber prices currently adds $36,000 to the cost of a new house.
