    I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the

* In March, [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/tread-plus-initial-statement) reported that one child died and a handful of others were injured as result of being pinned or pulled under the Tread+, one of its at-home treadmill models. In the weeks that followed, several other incidents involving children getting injured, as well as a pet and objects being sucked underneath the Tread+ were reported.
* In response, the [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread) (CPSC), an independent federal regulatory agency, opened an investigation and warned consumers with children to stop using the Tread+ immediately.
* Today, Peloton and CPSC issued a [joint statement](https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/tread-and-tread-recall) announcing the voluntarily recall of the Tread+, noting that [Peloton](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/peloton-recalls-tread-plus-treadmills-after-one-child-died-and-more-than-70-incidents) "_received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations_." Those who purchased the Tread+ are instructed to stop using it and contact Peloton for a full refund.
  * Peloton and CPSC also decided to voluntarily recall another treadmill model, the [Tread](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/peloton-recalls-tread-treadmills-due-to-risk-of-injury), due to reports of its touchscreen detaching and falling - although no injuries were reported.
