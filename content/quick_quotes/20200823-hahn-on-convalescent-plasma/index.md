* Convalescent plasma has been used to treat a range of infections/diseases in the past. Convalescent plasma COVID-19 treatment involves giving a patient the blood plasma from someone with the same blood type who has already recovered from COVID-19.
* The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-convalescent-plasma-potential-promising-covid-19-treatment) made the announcement, citing early promising data from over 70,000 American patients, saying the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.
  * Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said they’ve seen a [35% mortality reduction](https://www.c-span.org/video/?475099-1/president-trump-announces-fda-emergency-authorization-convalescent-plasma-therapy-covid-19-treatment) in the patients who have benefited the most from convalescent plasma – all of whom were under 80 and not receiving artificial respiration.
* **Why It Matters:** The FDA’s emergency use authorization opens up the possibility for quicker and easier access to the treatment *as* convalescent plasma studies and clinical trials continue.
  * Officials urge those who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. Learn about how to donate [HERE](https://thefightisinus.org/en-us#home)
