    In most situations, regular cleaning of surfaces with soap and detergent,
    not necessarily disinfecting those surfaces, is enough to reduce the risk of
    COVID-19 spread.

    CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky describing why the CDC updated its
    guidance for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces given the low risk of
    COVID-19 transmission.

During Monday’s press briefing by the White House COVID-19 Response Team, Dr. Walensky [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/04/05/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-24/) that although it’s possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted via contact with contaminated surfaces and objects, the latest data shows the risk of getting infected this way is “_actually low_.”

* Dr. Walensky [explained](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/04/05/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-24/) that while regular household cleaners (soap or detergent) might not kill germs, they still remove them, and that’s enough to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 in most situations. In comparison, disinfecting using a chemical product is only recommended for indoor settings where there’s been either a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 within the last 24 hours.
* The CDC’s updated [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html) still recommends regularly cleaning frequently touched household surfaces, like light switches and doorknobs, and encourages frequent cleaning if people in your home are at greater risk of a severe case of COVID-19. If someone in your home has COVID-19, the CDC recommends using disinfectant products ,and says that if the sick person is able to clean, having them do so, but if not, to use gloves while you clean and to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterwards.
