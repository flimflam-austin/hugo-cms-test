* The elected President was impeached nearly a week earlier by the congress – under allegations he mishandled the COVID pandemic AND [participated in bribery](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/10/933334195/in-midst-of-pandemic-crisis-perus-legislature-impeaches-the-nations-president).
* Merino assumed the presidency as head of the Peruvian congress – however citizens immediately protested as some perceived the ousting of the elected president, who ran on a platform against corruption, as a coup.
* The protests over the last week led to two deaths by police – dozens remain “missing” or injured.
* Citizens are protesting against corruption in gov’t – _“Half of the lawmakers are under investigation or indictment for alleged crimes including money laundering and homicide.”_ ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/15/935215282/perus-interim-president-resigns-after-a-tumultuous-week-of-protests))
* **Why It Matters:** Peru has no head of state and the path forward, for an otherwise stable Latin American country, appears uncertain.
