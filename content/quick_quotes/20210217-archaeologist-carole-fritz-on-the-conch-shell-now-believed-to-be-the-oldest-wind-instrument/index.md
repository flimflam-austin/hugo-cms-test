The [shell had sat in a French museum for decades](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/oldest-wind-instrument-scli-intl-scn/index.html), with its song silenced and unknown.

* Upon a recent second look, researchers noticed unique holes inconsistent with natural wear and concluded a craftsman had turned it into a musical instrument thousands of years ago.
* Archaeologists first unearthed the 12-inch conch in a cave in Southwestern France in the 1930’s. They originally thought it to be a ceremonial drinking cup.
* It is about 12,000 years older than what’s believed to be 2nd oldest musical instrument, a conch found in Syria.
