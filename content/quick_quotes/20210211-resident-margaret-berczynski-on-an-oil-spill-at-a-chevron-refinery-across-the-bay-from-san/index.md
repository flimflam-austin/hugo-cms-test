Officials say close to 600 gallons of oil spilled into a wharf off Point Richmond Tuesday afternoon, closing beaches until further notice.

* The spill lasted over 90 minutes, with about five gallons per minute leaking from the pipeline, according to Californiaâ€™s Office of Emergency Services; the cause of the leak appears to be an underground pipe.
* The California Department of Fish and Wildlife say there have been no reports of animals harmed.
* **Why This Matters:** Oil spills have plagued California for decades, including one in 1969 that leaked millions of gallons of crude into the ocean off the coast of Santa Barbara.
