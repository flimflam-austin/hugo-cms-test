    The common denominator through here is to engage China from a position of
    strength.
  citation: Ambassador Erica Barks-Ruggles on a specific G7 meeting on China.

* Ambassador Barks-Ruggles went on to say: _“Our goal is to not to have an us-versus-them, or to make allies pick and choose; our goal is to uphold the rules-based international order, which has helped keep the peace for the last 70 years.”_
* The G7 includes the United States, U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.
* Secretary of State Tony Blinken will be meeting with the G7 this week in Europe; a dinner will be dedicated to the Indo-Pacific region where China resides.

**Why It Matters:** During his Joint Address before Congress last week, Pres. Biden spoke about China's goals for world-domination. The meeting of the G7 follows those specific comments. The Biden administration thus far has remained opaque about specific China policy and prioritization - but further into the term, we'd expect to garner more specifics. This is a meeting to watch with great interest as it could provide some insight into the administration's foreign policy paradigm.
