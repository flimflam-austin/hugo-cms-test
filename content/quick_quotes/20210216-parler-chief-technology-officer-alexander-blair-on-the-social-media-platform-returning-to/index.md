Parler returned to operation Feb 15th after Amazon stopped its hosting agreement, effectively cutting off the company from the internet. Amazon said Parler violated its terms of use.

* No other major companies would “host” the company on their servers – effectively shutting the website down.
* Apple & Google will no longer carry the platform in their app stores.
* Why? Some accuse Parler, a social media platform, of spreading misinformation – specifically after the U.S. presidential election. Parler says it protects free speech.
* SkySilk, a California-based firm, is now hosting the website: _“Let me be clear, SkySilk does not advocate nor condone hate, rather, it advocates the right to private judgment and rejects the role of being the judge, jury, and executioner.” Kevin Matossian, SkySilk CEO. “Once again, this is not a matter of SkySilk endorsing the message, but rather, the right of the messenger to deliver it. SkySilk will support Parler in their efforts to be a nonpartisan Public Square as we are convinced this is the only appropriate course of action.”_
* **Why It Matters:** While within the right of companies to decide whom to work with – and whom not to – this story highlights the question of whether too much power exists in too few places, if a handful of tech companies can prevent another company from operating on the internet.

**Interesting to note:** _Parler filed a lawsuit in response, accusing Amazon of being motivated by “political animus” and arguing that it abused its power by effectively shutting down a competitor. A federal judge sided with Amazon in a preliminary ruling, saying it was in fact Parler that had violated the terms of its contract by not removing posts threatening public safety, flagged by Amazon._
