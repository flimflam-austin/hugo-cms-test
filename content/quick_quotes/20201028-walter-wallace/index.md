    I do not want to see my city tore down. We don’t need that. You’re not
    resolving anything for our family. Don’t do this in the name of my nephew
    because this is not what he would’ve wanted.

* Walter Wallace was killed Monday afternoon.
* Walter, 27, was black – the police officers appear to be white.
* The incident was caught on camera by a bystander.
* The video shows what appears to be Walter pacing around, and towards the officers.
* Reports: Walter’s family called the police due to a mental illness issue. Here’s [more from those who were there](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/10/27/walter-wallace-jr-s-family-pleads-for-end-to-unrest-following-deadly-police-shooting/) during the incident.
* Civil unrest began almost immediately, and included destruction, looting and rioting of local businesses.
* Police are calling areas of Philadelphia, “[a total loss](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/10/27/looting-continues-for-2nd-night-in-philadelphia-following-fatal-police-shooting-of-walter-wallace-jr/).” An estimate 30 police officers have been injured.
* **Why It Matters:** Beyond the obvious loss of life and ongoing investigation, this story highlights one of the most important stories of 2020 – the issue of race and law enforcement in America on the eve of the presidential election.
