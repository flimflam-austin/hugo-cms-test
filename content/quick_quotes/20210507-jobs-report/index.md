    I think this is just as much about a shortage in labor supply as it is about
    a shortage of labor demand.
  citation: Economist Jason Fuhrman on the lower than expected job creation in April.

---
* Fuhrman, who worked as an advisor for the Obama administration and is now an economist at Harvard University, says, _“If you look at April, it appears that there were about 1.1 unemployed workers for every job opening. So there are a lot of jobs out there, there is just still not a lot of labor supply.”_
* The expectations for April – 1 million jobs created. The data showed 266,000 created. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 6.1%.
* Some like Fuhrman may believe there is simply a lack of available workers, or qualified workers for the jobs that are available. [Others disagree, and say no labor shortage exists.](https://www.epi.org/blog/u-s-labor-shortage-unlikely-heres-why/)
* A revision to March's numbers lower also gave economists pause.
* **Why It Matters**: America still needs to recover 7.5 million jobs from pandemic's impact on the economy.
