South Korea’s military detected the two short range missiles around 7 a.m. Thursday local time (Wednesday evening for us).

* **Second time this week:** North Korea fired its first missiles of the Biden administration over the weekend. However, unlike the most recent launch, those missiles were said to be non-ballistic, which do not violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. See the different types of missiles North Korea has [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56518998).
* The timing: President Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is set to meet with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts late next week amid a push to strengthen America’s Asian alliances.
* **North Korean official:** Pyongyang will not resume denuclearization talks with the United States until the U.S. drops its “hostile” policies.
* Kim Jong Un has conducted four nuclear weapons tests and ordered the launch of more than 100 missiles in the past decade. The country claims it has weapons that could reach the continental U.S.

**Why it matters:** President Biden says he is speaking with allies and believes North Korea is one of his administration’s greatest foreign policy challenges.
