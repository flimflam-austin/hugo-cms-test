Dr. Walensky says there are _“more than 84 million people who were fully vaccinated”_ and they’ve_ “received reports of less than 6,000 breakthrough cases.”_

* Walenksy says this data is actually encouraging news, that “breakthrough” cases” (an infection more than 14 days after being fully vaccinated) show _“these vaccines are working”_ and prevent severe illness.
* Dr. Walensky says the number of those who have received a vaccine but also become ill with COVID is likely an “[underestimate](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/cdc-says-there-have-been-less-than-6000-breakthrough-covid-cases-among-fully-vaccinated-americans.html).” She says 30% of those with a vaccine but also with COVID had no symptoms.
* [More than half of all](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/half-americans-18-received-vaccine-shot-cdc/story?id=77151708) [**adult**](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/half-americans-18-received-vaccine-shot-cdc/story?id=77151708) [Americans have already received one dose](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/half-americans-18-received-vaccine-shot-cdc/story?id=77151708) of the vaccine (or almost 40% of the total population – CDC and 1 out of every 4 people vaccinated).
* In the last week both Pfizer and Moderna [have talked about the need of a third dose; currently people receive two](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/world/pfizer-vaccine-booster.html). 
* **Why It Matters:** While vaccinations have continued, up to 3-4 million doses administered a day, COVID-19 infections continue to raise concerns by health officials, who say this a [“complicated stage”](https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1384163169556262919?s=20) of the pandemic.
