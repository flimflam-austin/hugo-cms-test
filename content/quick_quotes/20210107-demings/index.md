* 4 people died – 1 woman due to a gun shot and 3 others due to “medical emergencies” after a mob broke into the U.S. Capitol.
* A large crowd gathered in D.C. on the day of the Electoral College vote in Congress for a planned rally in support of President Trump and his claims of voter fraud.
* The crowd listened to speakers including the President in the late morning of January 6th, eventually walked to Capitol Hill where some illegally broke into the U.S. Capitol, smashing windows, destroying property and eventually finding their way to the floor of the House and Senate.
* D.C. Metropolitan Police Department as of Wednesday night, only hours after the event provided this insight to The Associated Press: 52 people arrested (incl. 26 at the Capitol); 14 officers injured.
* We do not (as of yet) have numbers of how many people were able to enter the U.S. Capitol.
* **Something To Note:** The U.S. Capitol has its own law enforcement – [the U.S. Capitol Police.](https://www.uscp.gov/) The USCP’s mission is to protect lawmakers and the Capitol grounds – They are a federal law enforcement agency with the power to make arrests. It’s notable that these arrests on federal property are being handled by the D.C. police. We’ll report more as we gather an understanding as to why this is happening.
* Congresswoman Demings is a former police chief and went on to say in an interview she felt law enforcement wasn’t “prepared.” – _“I certainly thought that we would have had a stronger show of force, that there would have been steps taken in the very beginning to make sure that there was a designated area for the protesters in a safe distance from the Capitol…it did not seem that they had a clear operational plan.” MSNBC_
* **Why This Matters:** Democratic lawmakers are calling for an investigation into what they cite as a lack of preparedness by the U.S. Capitol Police on a day of historical importance (Joint Session of Congress counting Electoral College votes) with an expected crowd who advocated for challenging the results of the 2020 election.
