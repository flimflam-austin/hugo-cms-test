* 

After weeks of failed COVID-19 relief negotiations in Congress, Pres. Trump tigned four executive orders providing for the following:

  * **$400-per-week in supplemental unemployment** **benefits** to unemployment recipients. Previously, they received an extra $600 under a program that expired in July. Under the [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/), $300 will come from the federal government, with the states being asked to cover the remaining $100.
  * **Deferral of payroll tax collection for people making less than $100k.** This fourth round of payroll tax deferrals extends the holiday from September 1 to December 31. Pres. Trump [added](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/) “_If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I’m going to make them all permanent._“
  * **Deferral of student loan payments and interest until December 31.** An existing [policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/) set to expire in September suspended student loan payment and cut interest rates to 0%.
  * 

**Recommended protections for renters and homeowners.** The [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to “_promote the ability of renters and homeowners to avoid eviction or foreclosure resulting from financial hardships caused by COVID-19_.”

Pres. Trump received criticisms from legislators from both sides of the aisle – but for different reasons.

  * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) [said](https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi/) “_President Trump’s meager executive actions **do little for working families.** Republicans must come back to the negotiating table, meet us halfway and work toward a compromise that will truly help American workers and familie_s.”
  * Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) [said](https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7E22ECEA-CE33-4E4E-B109-6C0ED418170F) “_The pen-and-phone theory of executive lawmaking is unconstitutional slop. President Obama did not have the power to unilaterally rewrite immigration law with DACA, and President **Trump does not have the power to unilaterally rewrite the payroll tax law.** Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the American people acting through their members of Congress_.”
  * The President meanwhile accused the Democrats of too many “add-ons” to a stimulus bill: _“…what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money…They want to bailout states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years — and, in fact, in all cases, many decades. And we’re not willing to do that.” Read the [President’s comments HERE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/)_
