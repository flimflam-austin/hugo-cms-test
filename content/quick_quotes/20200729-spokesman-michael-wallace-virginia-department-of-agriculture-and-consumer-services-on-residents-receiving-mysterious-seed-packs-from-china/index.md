* The US Department of Agriculture plans to test these seeds.
* More than a dozen [states have reported residents randomly receiving packages of seeds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-officials-testing-mystery-seeds-mailed-to-u-s-residents-11595978122) with a return address to China; some seed packets have return addresses elsewhere including the United Arab Emirates although this has been less reported.
* Officials warn Americans not to plant the seeds, citing security concerns for invasive crops. _“It might be tempting to put this into some soil to see what happens, but there’s a lot of damage that can cause,” said Don Robison, seed administrator for the Office of Indiana State Chemist. “The last thing we want is to spread a weed, invasive species or disease, and that’s a real risk if people plant these or throw them in the garbage.” (Read more [here)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-officials-testing-mystery-seeds-mailed-to-u-s-residents-11595978122)._
