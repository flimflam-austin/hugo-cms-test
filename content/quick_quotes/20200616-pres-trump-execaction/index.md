The President met with families of those who had what he described as “deadly interactions with police” and said he made a commitment to create solutions for law enforcement, while at the same time complimenting the “overwhelming number of really good and great police officers.”

The executive order, though limited, aims to accomplish these goals:

* Create a national registry to track instances of police misconduct resulting in termination, criminal conviction or civil judgments.  
Grants certain funding to police departments that implement certain use of force and training standards, like banning chokeholds except if an officer’s life is at risk.
* Grants certain funding to police departments that involve social workers and mental health professionals on calls dealing with homelessness, mental illness and addiction.

Why This Matters: The executive order sets precedent for legislation currently being drafted by Congress, and can potentially compliment future law that may carry more “strength” than a unilateral move by the White House. As lawmakers go through a series of time-consuming negotiations before finalizing legislation, the President moved forward on these priorities.
