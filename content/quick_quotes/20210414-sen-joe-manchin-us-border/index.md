    Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) after a visit to the U.S. Southern Border – He
    says immigration reform is needed.

---
Manchin is considered a “centrist” democrat. He went on to say, _“When I call this a crisis, I’m not blaming the crisis on the present administration of President Biden, the former administration of President Trump,” he said. “This has been a human crisis for a long, long time.”_

* He both spoke about a pathway to citizenship for those who may have been in America illegally (a plan widely touted by Democrats) AND floated the idea of a 90-day moratorium on immigration at the U.S. border a long with requiring asylum seekers to apply in their own country (a plan supported previously by Republicans).
* **Why It Matters:** With the Senate so evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, a legislative solution would need compromise. Although Manchin says he is just “throwing out” ideas, reportedly a group of bipartisan Senators are discussing ways forward on immigration reform.
