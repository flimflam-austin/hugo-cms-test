On Monday afternoon, police responded to reports of an armed suspect at Austin-East Magnet High School. When police arrived, they encountered an armed student in a bathroom. Police ordered him to come out, but he refused and shot at them, before police returned fire.

* The suspect was shot dead and pronounced dead at the scene. A police officer sustained non-life-threatening injuries and is currently being treated at a local hospital. Knoxville’s mayor spoke with the injured officer, who she said he told her “_he’d rather that he be hurt than anybody else_.”
* Law enforcement have yet to identify the suspect or report his motive, though they say any updates, including the suspect’s identity will be disclosed via the [Tennessee Bureau of Investigation](https://tbinewsroom.com/2021/04/12/tbi-agents-investigating-knoxville-officer-involved-shooting/). One person was detained, however, it appears now that the person may actually be a witness. No additional victims have been reported.
* According to the [Knoxville News Sentinel](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2021/03/10/austin-east-high-school-knoxville-shootings-timeline/6938242002/), the suspect, a teen student, is the fifth teen in the area to die as a result of gun violence so far this year.
