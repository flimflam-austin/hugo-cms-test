    Pauline Delord, 15th generation forest guardian, on harvesting centuries-old
    oaks that will be used to rebuild the Notre Dame cathedral’s spire and
    wooden latticework roof, destroyed during a massive fire on April 15,
    2019.

* With the help of drones; foresters sought out and selected trees from hundreds of private and public properties across France, including an ancient forest that once belonged to kings. 
* More than 1,000 oaks of precise dimensions will be used to rebuild the more than 300 ft. tall spire, and roof. The trees must dry out for up to 18 months prior to construction. 
* Before the fire, the lattice of Notre Dame’s wooden beams and supports was so intricate it was nicknamed the “forest.” The 12th century cathedral took more than [180 years to build in its entirety](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/europe/notre-dame-cathedral-facts.html). 
* French President Emmanuel Macron hopes to have Notre Dame rebuilt “exactly as it was” by the time Paris hosts the 2024 summer Olympics--a timeline that many deem far too ambitious.

Why it matters: Attracting 12 to 14 million tourists each year before the fire; Notre Dame has occupied a spot in the heart of Paris, and in the hearts of people around the world for centuries.
