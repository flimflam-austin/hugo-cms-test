    I'm talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe and I think
    it's going to be a common theme across the board.

* [Qantas airlines](https://www.qantas.com/us/en.html) is based in Australia.
* Joyce was [interviewed on a major Australian broadcast network](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/qantas-airlines-covid-19-vaccine-alan-joyce/). He did not offer comprehensive details on the practicalities of how checking a passenger’s vaccine status would take place, but suggested [electronically verifying vaccination records](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/11/23/vaccination-passport-qantas-looking-new-requirement-travelers/6402846002/) for international travelers specifically.
* Private businesses and universities may impose requirements of patrons that are otherwise unavailable to gov’t agencies. However, whether or not this extends to vaccinations is a matter of debate. As news of Joyce’s comments spread, other airlines deferred to [vaccine requirements as a matter of public policy by governments – not corporations.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/11/23/vaccination-passport-qantas-looking-new-requirement-travelers/6402846002/)
* **Why It Matters:** As countries and businesses look to “re-open” borders and their economies, some have discussed an electronic passport to show proof of vaccinations. Whether or not that will come to market, and whether passengers will fall in step, is another question entirely.
