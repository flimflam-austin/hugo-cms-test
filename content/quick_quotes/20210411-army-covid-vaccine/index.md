* Researchers say the vaccine has shown immunity in animal tests (monkeys) agains the new coronavirus.
* The Army is looking to start a human trial on Tuesday with just over 70 individuals.
* The vaccine does not use a previously existing virus or mRNA technology but has developed a new way to present the identifying coronavirus "spike" protein to the body to build immunity.
* Dr. Modjarrad believes this vaccine may also work as a booster against newly discovered variants.
* **Why It Matters:** More than 200 vaccines are under production and many follow untraditional paths (for example - nasal sprays or liquid).
