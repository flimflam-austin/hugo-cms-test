* A list of the [“executive moves”](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/executive-actions-biden/index.html)
* President Biden’s first executive action: mask mandate on federal property.
* Notable executive actions: halt America’s “withdrawal” from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accord (environmental regulation agreement between nations) and ending the declaration of a national emergency at the U.S. southern border (this has consequences like stopping extra money flowing to projects at the border i.e. the construction of the border wall).
* **Why It Matters:** Pres. Biden wants to make good on promises he made to reverse some of the Trump administration’s policies. Executive actions are consequential. However, they are also vulnerable to future executive action, from a different administration.
