    in 2020 is extremely low.

* Speaking over the weekend, [Dr. Gottlieb](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-scott-gottlieb-discusses-coronavirus-on-face-the-nation-september-6-2020/) said that IF we have a vaccine available this year, it would likely only be used in “to protect very high-risk populations,” noting that 2021 is more likely.
* On Tuesday, the CEOs from nine drug manufacturers (AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi) issued what they called a [historic pledge](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/biopharma-leaders-unite-stand-science) “_to make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals the top priority in development of the first COVID-19 vaccines_.”
  * On Tuesday evening, [AstraZeneca](https://apnews.com/4239b8c69ba4b3703b2ca8c77810bf07) announced it paused its vaccine studies after its “standard review process” revealed a “a potentially unexplained illness.”
* According to the FDA, a COVID-19 vaccine needs to be at least **50%** effective in preventing COVID-19 and decreasing its severity.
* **BIG PICTURE:** To date, the nine drug manufacturers alone have developed over [70](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/biopharma-leaders-unite-stand-science) COVID-19 vaccines – [three](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html) are in Phase III trials.
