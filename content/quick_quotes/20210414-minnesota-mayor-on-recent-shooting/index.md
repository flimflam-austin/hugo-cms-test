    Brooklyn Center, Minnesota Mayor Mike Elliot on the fatal police shooting of
    Duante Wright, an unarmed 20-year-old black man, during a traffic stop.

---
On Sunday afternoon, Duante Wright was pulled over by police for driving with expired registration tags. After he was pulled over, the police determined there was an outstanding warrant out for his arrest in connection with gross misdemeanor charges.

  * Specifics of the charges have yet to be confirmed, however, in Minnesota gross misdemeanors are punishable by up to one year in jail.

* As officers attempted to handcuff Wright, he got back in his car, and officer Kim Potter shot him at close range. Wright drove away and made it several blocks before his vehicle struck another one. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
* In body camera footage of the shooting released by police, Potter can be heard shouting “_taser_” multiple times before she shot Wright. Afterwards, she can be heard saying “_I just shot him_.”
  * During a press conference on Monday, the police chief said he believed the officer accidentally discharged her gun and meant to use her taser. He also said the “_very senior_” officer has been placed on administrative leave.
* Sunday’s shooting has sparked massive protests in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb located just miles away from where the trial of Derek Chauvin is underway. Chauvin is the former police officer faces charges of murdering George Floyd. As a result of the protests, curfews have been imposed in Brooklyn Center and the surrounding cities and counties.
* **UPDATE:** On Tuesday, Kim Potter resigned stating ““_I have loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability, but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately._” The Brooklyn Center police chief also resigned.
