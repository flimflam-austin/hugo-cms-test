* [The ban will begin on Tuesday, May 4th.](undefined)
* The U.S. will join a list of other countries who have also banned travel from one of the largest countries in the world (India pop = 1.3B+). 
* One thing to note: A strain of COVID-19 known as B.1.617 was first identified in India and some question whether this strain has led to more contagion in India (however [this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/us-to-restrict-travel-from-covid-ravaged-india.html) points out this strain, now in the United States, has two mutations found in other variants too).
* Also interesting [_"United Airlines is the only major U.S. carrier operating nonstop service between the two countries, with four daily departures to India."_](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/us-to-restrict-travel-from-covid-ravaged-india.html)
* **Why This Matters:** The U.S. has limited or banned travel for non-American citizens from countries like China and Brazil - the same applies for India.
