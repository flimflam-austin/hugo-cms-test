* Conway will leave at the end of the month.
* Her husband, an open critic of Pres. Trump, also announced [he will leave a democrat leaning organization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-white-house/2020/08/23/6c26e18a-e5a7-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html), The Lincoln Project, as well.
* The Conways said they needed to turn their attention to their family.
* Backstory: Over the last several days, Conway’s [15 year-old daughter took to social media](https://www.today.com/news/kellyanne-conway-s-daughter-claudia-conway-15-says-she-s-t190044), criticizing her parents and threatening to take them to court for full emancipation for their role in politics. It is not known if she took the actual legal steps to do this.
* Here is her full statement: [CLICK HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/idvi2pijsbv1ku5/KAC.pdf?dl=0)
* Why It Matters: Conway is the first woman in U.S. history to lead a successful presidential campaign (she led President Trump’s campaign in 2016). Her future plans are not known but she is a critical member of President Trump’s team leaving the White House at a critical juncture.
