* On October 8, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) [announced](https://www.debates.org/2020/10/08/cpd-announces-second-presidential-debate-will-be-virtual/) the Oct. 15th second presidential debate will take the form of a virtual town meeting. The candidates will participate from separate remote locations “_in order to protect the health and safety of all involved._”
  * Recall that after the first chaotic presidential debate on Sept. 29, CPD [announced](https://smarthernews.com/article/debate-change/) it would announce upcoming changes to the debate structure shortly.
  * **FYI:** CPD is the nonprofit organization that’s sponsored ever presidential debate since 1988. According to its website, CPD’s goal is “_to ensure that the voting public has the opportunity to see the leading candidates debate during the general election campaign,_” accordingly CPD does not receives no funding from the government or any political party, political action committee or candidate.
* Minutes later, Pres. Trump appeared on the Fox Business channel and [said](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-virtual-debate-wont-participate-coronavirus-maria-bartiromo-interview) he’s not going to waste his time on a virtual debate. Shortly afterwards, his campaign manager Bill Stepien, who is one of the [over 20 people](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/34-people-connected-white-house-previously-infected-coronavirus/story?id=73487381) connected to the campaign and/or White House who tested positive for COVID-19 recently, [said](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/08/921538492/second-presidential-debate-to-be-virtual-commission-says)

> “_President Trump will have posted multiple negative tests prior to the debate, so there is no need for this unilateral declaration. The safety of all involved can easily be achieved without canceling a chance for voters to see both candidates go head to head. We’ll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead_.”

* In response, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield [released](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/08/921538492/second-presidential-debate-to-be-virtual-commission-says) the following statement: “_Vice President Biden looks forward to speaking directly to the American people and comparing his plan for bringing the country together and building back better with Donald Trump’s failed leadership on the coronavirus that has thrown the strong economy he inherited into the worst downturn since the Great Depression_.”

**UPDATE:** On October 9, CPD [announced](https://www.debates.org/2020/10/09/statement-by-the-commission-on-presidential-debates-cpd-october-15-presidential-debate-will-not-proceed/) the Oct. 15th second presidential debate was officially cancelled.
