    ...cats may be a silent intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, because infected
    cats may not show any appreciable symptoms that might be recognized by their
    owners.

* Researchers inoculated cats with SARS-CoV-2 and then housed the cats with 3 others without exposure.
* Eventually all 6 cats showed presence of the virus but no symptoms.
* Researchers found evidence of the virus in nose swabs on the cats for several days.
* They say more research is needed.
* **Why It Matters:** Researchers say families need to know about the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pet cats. This is especially important if family members are self-isolating within a home to prevent other family members from becoming ill. _“With reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to domestic cats1 and to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo,4 coupled with our data showing the ease of transmission between domestic cats, there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human–cat–human transmission.”_
