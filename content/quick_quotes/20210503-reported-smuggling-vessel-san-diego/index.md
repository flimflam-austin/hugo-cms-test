* **Context:** Customs and Border Protection just issued [THIS PRESS RELEASE ](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/san-diego-officials-ramp-operations-warn-against-illegal-entry-sea)on Friday, April 30th, suggesting a rising trend in "maritime" smuggling operations off the coast of San Diego.
* **Sunday May 2nd: **A capsized vessel off the coast of San Diego near the border led to a rescue operation with local life guards, Coast Guard and Border Protection.
* _“Once we arrived on scene, the boat had basically been broken apart. Conditions were pretty rough: 5 to 6 feet of surf, windy, cold.”_ [San Diego Lifeguard Services Lt. Rick Romero. ](https://apnews.com/article/san-diego-092f01e335e58c1d51531c30e7be841a)
* 27 people were transported to the hospital with a variety of injuries. 
* **Why It Matters:** We expect Customs & Border Protection to release new numbers about activity at the U.S. Southern Border for the month of April. After a record-breaking month in March for border apprehensions, the April numbers will provide further context. While the focus remains on land-crossings at the border, this story serves as a reminder about challenges overall for Border Patrol.
