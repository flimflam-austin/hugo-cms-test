The “moving day” for the former kings (18) and queens (4) was captured in a two-hour live television event (produced by the government) celebrating Egypt’s civilization.

* Trucks outfitted to look like boats (which once carried Pharaohs to their tombs) transported the mummies in specially-created cases – Egypt even resurfaced roads to make sure the trip would be smooth.
* The mummies included some of the most well-known Pharaohs including Ramses II and Queen Hatshepsut (the first of only a few female Pharaohs).
* [**The New York Times:**](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/world/middleeast/cairo-mummies-parade.html) The lavish government-sponsored event contrasted with some of the economic realities and divisions in Egypt’s capital city.
* Some suggest the event, called **The Pharaohs’ Golden Parade**, was to encourage tourism as the pandemic has severely impacted one of Egypt’s main industries.
* **Why It Matters:** The invaluable mummies will now be preserved and/or displayed at the new [National Museum of Egyptian Civilization](https://nmec.gov.eg). The lavish event speaks to the importance of this moment for the Egyptian government trying to recover from the pandemic and recent barrage of news – such as the cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal, a waterway managed by Egypt.
