* The FDA is expected to authorize the vaccine for ages 12 to 15 in the U.S. by next week  (it's currently approved for 16+). 
* In late March, Pfizer published the preliminary results of its vaccine study involving 2,260  American volunteers in this age group: researchers reported zero cases of COVID-19 among those who were fully vaccinated. 18 cases were identified in the placebo group. 
* [Side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) reported in adolescents include pain, fever, chills, and fatigue (usually after the second dose), similar to young adults. 
* **What's next?** President Biden announced states and federal pharmacies are "ready to move immediately" after FDA authorization, adding the shots will also be distributed to family doctors and pediatricians. Moderna and Pfizer are currently conducting COVID-19 vaccine trials on children as young as six months old. 
* **Why It Matters: **While the virus rarely has dire consequences for children based on recent studies, some experts believe the key to reducing transmission of COVID-19 to more vulnerable groups includes vaccinating children.
