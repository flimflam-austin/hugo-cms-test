* Sheiner and others [put together a report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/officials-call-for-quick-stimulus-deal-to-forestall-lackluster-u-s-economic-recovery-11603450801) suggestion a “roughly” $2T stimulus would help accelerate the economic recover – but delay could spread out the pain for the better part of a decade.
* Republicans and Democrats remain apart on a potential economic stimulus package.
* Other stimulus packages have boosted unemployment benefits (with additional federal dollars added to state benefits) and small business loans and federal money for key industries like the airlines.
* Democrats passed a plan for $2.2 T in the House – Republicans attempted to pass a more targeted stimulus in the Senate for around $500B but were unable to garner the Democrat votes needed to pass it.
* [Republicans and others are concerned](https://www.smarthernews.com/article/stimulus-update-oct-21/) about what the spending will do to America’s debt, future economic health.
* Democrats want the spending to flow towards get cities and states that Republicans argue had economic challenges before COVID-19.
