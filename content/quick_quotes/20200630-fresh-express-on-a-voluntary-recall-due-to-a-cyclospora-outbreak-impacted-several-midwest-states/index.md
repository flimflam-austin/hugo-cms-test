* The CDC believes a cyclospora outbreak is linked to pre-package lettuce made by Fresh Express.
* More than 200 people are sick across 8 states in the Midwest.
* Cyclospora is a parasite than can cause a series of symptoms – include flu-like symptoms.
* **Why It Matters:** Overall awareness. Fresh Express makes a series of salad mixes under other names, leading to a domino effect of recalls. Cyclospora parasite causes symptoms similar to those described by the virus that causes COVID-19.
