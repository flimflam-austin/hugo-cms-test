    periods in Nashville's history.

_“… the second-highest two-day rainfall total in Nashville history, and the most for a single day in March.” –_The Nashville Tennessean

* The water continues to rise even with the rainfall ceasing.
* Nashville’s mayor declared a local state of emergency.
* More than 100 people had to be rescued; several died.
* **Why It Matters:** The intensity of the rainfall and flooding in a concentrated area led to a dangerous mix for Tennesseans. Authorities reminded locals that 6 inches of water is enough to impact your balance, and about two feet of water can sweep away your car.
