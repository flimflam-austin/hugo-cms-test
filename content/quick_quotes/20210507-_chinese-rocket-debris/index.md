    Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell on the debris from a Chinese rocket
    that's expected to fall to Earth around this Saturday.

* The Pentagon said exactly where it will hit "cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its reentry." 
* China launched The Long March 5B rocket (weighing between 20-25 tons at launch) on April 29. It carried a key part for China's permanent space station, currently in construction. 10 more missions are planned through 2022 to complete it. 
* Space experts expect much of the debris to burn up before re-entry, and to fall into the ocean, although there is a small chance it could hit a populated area. McDowell said the impact will likely be "equivalent of a small plane crash scattered over 100 miles." 
* **This is not the first time: **Last spring, a piece of a Chinese rocket [weighing  nearly 20 tons flew over New York](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/chinese-rocket-falls-to-earth-space-debris-problem-worsens.html) and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean-- the largest piece of space debris to hit Earth in decades.The [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers) estimated 9,000 tons of space junk are currently in orbit.

**Why It Matters:  **A growing number of countries are entering the space race, which experts and governments say creates a need for stricter, more thorough regulations.
