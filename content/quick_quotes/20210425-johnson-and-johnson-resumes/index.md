    The CDC & FDA in a joint statement issued Friday, ending the 10-day
    recommended pause on use of the Johnson & Johnson (Jansen) one-dose COVID
    vaccine following a thorough safety review.

On April 13, the CDC and FDA announced it was recommending a pause on use of the J&J vaccine due to reports of thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/03-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf) describes TTS as a "_rare, but clinically serious and potentially life-threatening adverse event_."

  * TTS is not *just* blood clotting – it’s blood clotting WITH a condition of low platelets, which can potentially cause severe internal bleeding.
  * According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/03-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf), out of the 6.8 million administered J&J vaccine doses administered, 15 cases of TTS were reported among women ages 18 to 64, resulting in three deaths.
      * American Society of Hematology President Martin S. Tallman, MD provided a big picture perspective in response to the lifting of the pause, [noting](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fauci-johnson-johnson-vaccine-temporary-pause-safety/story?id=77289028) that "COVID-19 infection carries a much higher risk of blood clots — 147,000 in 1 million hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience clots, compared to roughly two in 1 million individuals who received the J&J vaccine."

* During the safety review, the [FDA and CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda-cdc-lift-vaccine-use.html) worked to assess the risk of TTS and concluded "_the vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19_." Additionally, the FDA "_determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older._"
* In response to recent reports of fewer numbers of people getting vaccinated and vaccine hesitancy, White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci [said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fauci-johnson-johnson-vaccine-temporary-pause-safety/story?id=77289028) the J&J pause actually shows how thorough the federal gov't agencies are being. "The _CDC and the FDA are the gold standard for both safety and the evaluation of efficacy, I think in the long run what we're going to see - and we'll probably see it soon - is that people will realize that we take safety very seriously,_" he said.
