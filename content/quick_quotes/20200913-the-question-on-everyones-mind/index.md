* **COVID-19:** Speaking on Friday, [Dr. Fauci](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html) indicated the U.S. is not yet “rounding the corner”, citing the more than 6 million U.S. and 190,000 deaths across the country, with up to 4,000 new cases and 1,000 deaths being reported daily.
