The Florida governor declared a state of emergency in the county: “What we’re looking at now is trying to prevent — and respond to if need be — a catastrophic flood issue,” [Gov. DeSantis](https://weather.com/news/news/2021-04-03-leak-at-florida-phosphate-plant-tampa-bay-manatee-county-piney-point).

* The reservoir is called “Piney Point” – a former phosphate plant – but the facility is showing signs of leakage.
* Residents and some workers were evacuated.
* The plant holds wastewater from past fertilizer production; early reports called the water “radioactive” but the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection says that’s not the case](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/03/us/piney-point-state-of-emergency/index.html).
* **Why It Matters**: The wastewater plant has been a matter of debate for decades, and the potential failure of the reservoir raises concerns about damage to surrounding wildlife in Tampa Bay, loss of property and harm to individuals.
