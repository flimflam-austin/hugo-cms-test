    It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of
    [hydroxychloroquine] and [chloroquine] may be effective in treating
    COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential
    benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks.

* In March, the FDA approved emergency use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate for treating COVID-19, allowing the anti-malarial drugs to be used in ways in which they had not yet been tested for. At the time, there were reports and limited studies indicating that some COVID-19 patients appeared to recover more quickly using the treatment.
* In April, the FDA warned against treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to the risk of heart rhythm problems.
* In May, Pres. Trump faced criticism when he announced he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure.
* On Monday, based on results from a large, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients that found hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine showed no benefit for speeding recovery or decreasing the likelihood of death, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization.
* The revocation of the emergency use authorization does *not* mean the drugs will be removed from the market â€“ it just means that the anti-malarial drugs are still available for their approved uses, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus.
