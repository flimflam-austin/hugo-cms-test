    Google’s anticompetitive actions have protected its general search
    monopolies and excluded rivals, depriving consumers of the benefits of
    competitive choices, forestalling innovation, and undermining new entry or
    expansion.

* On Thursday, a 30+ state bipartisan coalition led by Colorado [sued](https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2020/12/Colorado-et-al.-v.-Google-PUBLIC-REDACTED-Complaint.pdf) Google, accusing it of maintaining a monopoly using exclusionary agreements in order to leverage its own products over those of its competitors.
* On Wednesday, a 10-state coalition of Republican attorneys general led by Texas filed an [antitrust lawsuit](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/20201216%20COMPLAINT_REDACTED.pdf) against Google, accusing it of anti-competitive advertising practices – including an unlawful agreement with Facebook.
* In October, the DOJ filed an [antitrust lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws) against Google, accusing the company of abusing its monopoly power and using anticompetitive practices to ensure Google is the default search engine on browsers.
* **BIG PICTURE:** These recent legal challenges against Google, often described as the “gateway to the internet,” come after a 48-state 2019 investigation into the company’s search dominance. The lawsuits are likely to be combined and could result in major fines and/or modifications of Google’s business practices.
