* “A lot of people need a lot of hope this year ’cause of the Covid-19, and we were more than honored to donate it. And hopefully we bring some joy into some people’s lives this season.” [Paula Dick](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/us/rockefeller-christmas-tree-arrival-trnd/index.html) who lives in Oneonta, NY., roughly 170 miles from NYC.
* The tree made its 3 hour journey to New York City this weekend in preparation for the holidays – The tree had an NYPD escort.
* More than 5 miles of lights will bright the tree on December 2nd, 2020 for the official lighting.
* The star at the top of the tree weights 900lbs!
* **Why It Matters:** The Rockefeller Christmas tree dates back to the 1930s. [Rockefeller Center says workers first made the effort to bring a Christmas tree to life in 1931 – but the property made it official in 1933.](https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/) This American tradition continues despite the COVID-19 pandemic, as New York State considers more restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.
