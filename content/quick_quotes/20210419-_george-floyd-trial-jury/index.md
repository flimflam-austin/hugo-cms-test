    During your deliberations, you must not let bias, prejudice, passion,
    sympathy, or public opinion influence your decision.

    Judge Peter Cahill to the jury before deliberations began on the murder case
    against Derek Chauvin, the former police officer accused of killing George
    Floyd.

The jury includes 14 individuals (12 sitting jurors and 2 alternatives) – according to the latest reports: 9 women, 5 men; 8 white, 4 black and 2 identify as multi-racial; the majority are in their 40s or younger.

* The jury will consider the charges: second degree murder, third degree murder and second degree manslaughter – Important to note: NONE of these charges require an INTENT to kill but rather focus on Chauvin’s state of mind and his consequent behavior – whether he knowingly engaged in a felony (an assault) or knowingly acted in reckless or negligent disregard for human life.
* Reminder: The prosecution has the burden of convincing the jury of its argument. The defense, like in any other case, has the burden of convincing *at least* ONE JUROR of their argument…one juror could lead to a hung jury. The jury will be sequestered (isolated, staying in a hotel, forbidden from watching media, etc) during deliberation.
* **Why It Matters:** Less than one year after George Floyd’s death a jury of his peers will decide the fate of the man accused of killing him.
* **Just a note:** there’s a federal case that’s also pending against Derek Chauvin that is separate from this one so expect to hear more on this case this week and in weeks to come.
