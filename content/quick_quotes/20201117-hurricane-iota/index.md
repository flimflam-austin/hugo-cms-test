* The [National Hurricane Center considers Hurricane Iota](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?start#contents) to be a “catastrophic hurricane, with extreme winds and a life-threatening storm surge.”
* Hurricanes are often categorized 1-5, 5 being the most severe. This reading is based on the force of wind – the higher the number, the stronger the storm.
* Hurricane Iota comes just two weeks after Hurricane Eta (a Category 4 storm) hit leaving an estimated 200+ dead or missing in Central America. The two hurricanes hit almost the identical location in Northern Nicaragua, impacting Honduras as well – [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/11/17/nicaragua-eta-iota-landfalls/) journalists tried to find how many times that has happened in history: _“There have been some unlucky areas and close calls before, but having two Category 4 hurricanes strike within 15 miles in just two weeks is something we couldn’t find matched in nearly 170 years of data.”_
* **History-Making:** Hurricane Iota is the [30th named storm in the Atlantic Hurricane Season](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/16/hurricane-iota-category-5-status-possible-central-america-landfall/6308866002/) (which ends on November 30th) – the most storms EVER on record.
* **Why It Matters:** The displacement of tens of thousands from their homes presents a humanitarian crisis as authorities work to evacuate residents in affected areas, which may be considered uninhabitable for weeks, if not longer.
