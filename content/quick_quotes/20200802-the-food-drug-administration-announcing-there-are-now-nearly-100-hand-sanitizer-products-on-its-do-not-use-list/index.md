* Over the past two months, the FDA has continued to warn consumers against using certain hand sanitizer products.
  * Some contain low levels of alcohol – the active ingredient in hand sanitizer. The CDC [recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html) consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
  * Others contain dangerous levels of methanol (wood alcohol). Methanol can be toxic and even life-threatening. The FDA [warns](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use) that “_substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death_.”
* Many, but not all of the products listed on the FDA’s list have been recalled. For that reason, the FDA [urges](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-reiterates-warning-about-dangerous-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizers) consumers to avoid all hand sanitizer products from all of the manufacturers on the list.
