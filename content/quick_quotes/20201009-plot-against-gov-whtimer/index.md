    When I put my hand on the bible and took the oath of office 22 months ago, I
    knew this job would be hard, but I’ll be honest – I never could’ve imagined
    anything like this.

* According to the [criminal complaint](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7223362/Michigan-Kidnapping-Conspiracy.pdf), accusing more than a dozen people of actively preparing and training for a mission they planned to carry out at some point ahead of Election Day (November 3), the group first met in June, and conducted surveillance for over two weeks throughout August and September.
  * More charges and additional defendants are expected, according to Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.
* Speaking shortly after the charges were announced Gov. Whitmer, a Democrat, [squarely blamed President Trump](https://www.facebook.com/GovGretchenWhitmer/videos/346049466647915) for “_fomenting division_” and encouraging hate groups, like the two militia groups accused of plotting against her. The President responded later in the day during a Fox News interview, stating that his administration’s Justice Department is the one filing charges against those allegedly behind the plot.
* **BIG PICTURE:** Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said there’s been “_a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies,_” noting that these groups often seize on moments of civil unrest to advance their agenda and recruit new members. “_This is more than just political disagreement or passionate advocacy, some of these groups’ mission is simply to create chaos and inflict harm upon others_,” she said.
