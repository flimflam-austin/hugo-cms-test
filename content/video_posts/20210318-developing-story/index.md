Breaking news is like crashing waves. . We need to pay attention but we can’t ignore the undercurrents. 

Here’s the latest out of Georgia - the few details we know about one of the most deadly mass killings of late. 

And here’s the context, the undercurrents, for why there’s even more heightened attention on this crime - reports of a rise in violence, aggression against Asians in America during the pandemic. 

Plus - one of the big lessons I learned in 2020 in my reporting that I want to apply to 2021. The limitations of data and the importance of personal experience to fill in the blanks.
