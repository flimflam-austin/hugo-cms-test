{{< youtube id="OXzqH1g5nKw" >}}

A quick primer for the rapid-fire headlines from the Middle East.  
.  
Some of the fiercest fighting in years has happened in this region over the last week. How we arrived at this moment depends on who you ask.  
.  
In this video we detail some of the official stance of the U.S. government. Depending on where you live, your perspective and even the map of this area, may look different.   
.  
Just a note of clarification - Israel’s relationship with the West Bank and Gaza is also varied. Israel maintains some jurisdiction over The West Bank, but not Gaza.  
.   
There are many threads of this story we didn’t discuss in this 7 minute video - What would you like a deeper dive on?
