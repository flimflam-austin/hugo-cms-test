Here’s the study on [droplet spread from Florida Atlantic University and a short video from SmartHER News](https://smarthernews.com/article/simulating-covid-19-spread-is-this-what-a-covid-cough-looks-like/)



YOUR RUNDOWN 👇🏼 

A year after “15 days to slow the spread” - we have new guidance on social distancing in schools. 

0:00- 2:00 - @cdcgov now says 6 feet between desks in a classroom can now be 3 feet for schools K-12. Why now? 

2:00 - 6:00 What to know about social distancing? What I’ve learned in my reporting over the last year. 3 notable facts. 

6-8:00 Consider this - we are in a new chapter, yet again, on this pandemic. How will 6-3 feet in schools impact other policies? TBD. . Btw - this is notable about NEW studies now versus last year.
