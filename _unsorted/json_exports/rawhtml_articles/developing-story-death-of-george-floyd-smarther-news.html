<p><strong>Monday May 25th:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Minneapolis convenience store called police, accusing 46-year-old Floyd of using a counterfeit $20 bill.</li>
<li>Police responded and arrested Floyd, who sat in a nearby car with two other people.</li>
<li>Police <a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/police/records/frequent">reported</a>&nbsp;they ordered the suspect out of the vehicle and the suspect physically resisted officers. Here’s a partial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKV7Mi9YUAQ">video of what happened prior to the police handcuffing Floyd.</a></li>
<li>After police handcuffed Floyd, they walked him across the street and out of camera view.</li>
<li>A bystander recorded what happened later during the arrest. Floyd is on the ground, face down, handcuffed with a Police Officer Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck.</li>
<li>Floyd repeatedly says, “<em>Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man</em>.”</li>
<li>Bystanders pleaded with police to stop kneeling on Floyd’s neck.</li>
<li>The officer did not remove his knee.</li>
<li>Floyd appeared to have fallen unconscious.</li>
