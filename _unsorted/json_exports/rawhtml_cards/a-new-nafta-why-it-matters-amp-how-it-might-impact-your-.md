    TRADING UP?
    ===========

    America & Mexico agree \*in theory\* to a new trade deal.  
    Will Canada come a long for the ride?

    NAFTA 101

    ---------


    *   Trade deal negotiated under Pres. H. W. Bush & steered through Congress
    by Pres. Clinton.

    *   **Simple Overview:**A Lowered tariffs (taxes) between Canada, Mexico &
    U.S. so we could all do business more easily and cheaply.

    *   Pres. Trump called it the “**single worst trade deal ever**” because he
    says it allowed American jobs to go to Mexico; many disagree.

    Why Now?

    --------


    Mexico & U.S negotiating NAFTA behind the scenes for weeks.


    *   New government of Mexico \*just\* elected & both sides want to secure
    deal before new leadership takes office.

    *   New trade deal needs approval by Congress; completing draft puts
    pressure on Congress to act before or after midterm elections.

    What’s At Stake?

    ----------------


    **American jobs, industry & pay.**


    One example of many potential changes: New “NAFTA” agreement reportedly
    requires **more** U.S. car parts made in America with more U.S. material
    (like steel) in exchange for the “no tax” benefit for companies.

    The North American Trade Agreement was a result of a trifecta of Mexico,
    Canada & the U.S. Since the U.S. & Mexico have a working template, the big
    question is: Will Canada agree to negotiations or stall them?
