    which are still in effect today, including:


    *   establishing the **Social Security** program (1935)

    *   creating **union** & collective bargaining laws (1935)

    *   enacting **child labor** laws (1936)

    *   setting up federal **minimum wage** laws & the **40-hour workweek**
    (1938)

    In 2008, the Frances Perkins Center was established in Maine to honor
    Perkins' legacy and continue her work. The nonprofit and nonpartisan center
    recently purchased Perkins' ancestral homestead, which was designated a
    National Historic Landmark.
