    The Great Vaccine Debate

    ------------------------


    **Should you have the right to \*not\* vaccinate your child?**


    A measles outbreak prompts lawmakers to consider reversing course on
    policies they may have helped put in place.

    What’s Going On:

    ----------------


    *   Measles cases in 10 states, some tied to low vaccination rates.

    *   46 states: allow religious exemptions to vaccinations.

    *   17 states: allow for “philosophical” exemptions for personal beliefs.

    *   In the wake of recent outbreaks, Washington & Oregon are looking to
    potentially tighten laws that allow for these personal exemptions.

    Who Decides Who Vaccinates & Where?

    -----------------------------------


    *   Federal gov’t makes **recommendations, not laws or policies,A** re:
    vaccines.

    *   Your state gov’t sets requirements for vaccinations at a local level,
    normally for attending school.

    *   **Why?** Simply – the federal gov’t is responsible for our national
    security and your state, for your personal safety.

    Current measles vaccination rate in America is approx. 90%; Some states have
    lower. In general, a community needs to have 90-95% vaccination rates for
    "herd immunity" that prevents the spread of a contagious disease.
