    What’s Happening
    ----------------

    A civil war rages inside Yemen: “Houthi”A Rebels vs. Yemeni gov’t.

    U.N.-led talks between the 2 sides take place in Geneva this week.

    Rebels backed by Iran; Saudis back the Yemeni gov’t (as does U.S.).

    **Big Question:** Do talks help the 4-year conflict or make situation worse?

    don't have basic needs. U.S. Defense Secretary recently said America's
    support of Saudi Arabia has to include an effort to avoid civilian
    casualties.
