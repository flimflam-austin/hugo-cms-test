    Why Have Hearings?

    ------------------


    *   President has power to nominate, but Senate must confirm.

    *   During the hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee will ask Kavanaugh
    about his judicial philosophy to get an idea of how he \*might\* rule in the
    future.

    *   Expect to hear about big issues: abortion, presidential powers, etc.

    KAVANAUGH’S CHANCES?

    --------------------


    *   In 2017, the Senate changed its rules to allow confirmation by a simple
    majority (51 of 100) instead of needing 60 votes.

    *   GOP will have a 51-49 majority going into the confirmation vote;
    Kavanaugh may get “Yes” votes from Democrats as well.
