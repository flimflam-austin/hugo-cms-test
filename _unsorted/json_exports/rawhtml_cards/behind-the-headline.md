    BIG PICTURE: U.S.A.
    -------------------

    Americans are **earning more**.

    **Fewer people in poverty** (lowest number since 2006).

    It’s a trend. Income increased last year for the **third year in a row.**

    $61,371 = median household income.

    THE WAGE DEBATE

    ---------------


    The American economy has grown, added jobs & workers… but data shows our
    **income is NOT rising as quickly, as expected, as previous years, or
    compared to what things cost (inflation)**.


    Do we look like we make more on paper, but have less $pending power?

    What’s Going on?

    ----------------


    No one knows for sure: 2 theories


    **White House:**A Bad data & wage growth is good. Stats don’t consider tax
    cuts & other perks. Some (non-WH) economists agree.


    **Another theory:**A People reentering workforce may get lower paying or
    part-time jobs, or have fewer qualifications, so they make less $$.

    Something To Consider: The way the census measures median income has
    changed. Some say that makes the data difficult to compare to previous
    years. It's a good reminder data tells us only so much of a story. How do
    you feel about your wages and the economy?

    We should also admit the possibility that there is no problem to solve, no mystery to explain a that wages are growing in line with the economyas overall performance. Moodyas Analytics economist Adam OzimekA findsA that when you measure slack using the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate, wages are growing at a pace you would expect.Or consider a simpler calculation: Roughly speaking, wages grow if workers are more productive and if overall prices are increasing. Productivity growth has been lower this cycle than in the past, and based on its performance wage growth is only slightly slower than youad expect.These are compelling arguments, but Iam not sold. Wage growth is slower than wead expect, and the reason is something of a mystery. Some combination of all the factors weave discussed is probably the culprit. This is good news, because it means that a healthy rate of wage growth is likely in the future. But letas hope the future arrives sooner rather than later.
