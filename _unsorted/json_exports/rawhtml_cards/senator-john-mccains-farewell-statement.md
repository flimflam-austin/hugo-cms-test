> “My fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served 60 years, and especially my fellow Arizonans,
> 
> Thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life of service in uniform and service in public office has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them.
> 
> Iave often observed that Iam the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. Iave loved my life, all of it. Iave had experiences, adventures, friendshipsA enough for 10 satisfying lives, and I am so thankful.A Like most people, I have regrets.A But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anybody elseas.
> 
> I owe this satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to Americaas causes a liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all peopleA a brings happiness more sublimeA than lifeas fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves.
> 
> ‘Fellow Americans’A aA that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the worldas greatest republic, a nation of ideals,A not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history.A We have acquired great wealth and great power in the process.
> 
> We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change theyave always been.
> 
> We are 325 million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes evenA vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country, we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do.
> 
> Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening.
> 
> I feel it powerfully still.
> 
> Do not despair of our present difficulties butA believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit.A We never surrender.A We never hide from history. We make history.
> 
> Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you and God bless America.”
