    Selfie Study

    ------------


    *   Researchers looked at social media posts in 183 countries.

    *   **Results:** More “sexy selfies” come from places, like U.S., where
    women have more opportunities.

    *   **Why?** Researchers say areas with greater upward mobility often have
    higher income inequality.

    *   Analysis:A **Sexy selfies “sell”**; reflect desire to climb in social
    status.

    with other women**,A for higher status, and finding a mate.

    "In evolutionary terms, these kinds of behaviors are completely rational,
    even adaptive. The basic idea is that the way people compete for mates, and
    the things they do to put themselves at the top of the hierarchy are really
    important." Read more about the study here:
