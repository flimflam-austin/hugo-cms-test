Macron speaking to French lawmakers Wednes. As the threat of more protests loom, lawmakers canceled the fuel tax from the 2019 budget.

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   Protests in France have inspired other violent protests in Europe.

    *   In Brussels, protestors took to the streets over higher taxes and food
    prices.

    *   **Big Picture**: The European Union is under pressure as the U.K’s exit
    looms & Russia rattles Ukraine. How long will this political crisis in
    France last? What’s the impact?

    America has a fuel tax too. Federal & state fees typically add approximately
    52Ac/gallon. These taxes have helped to pay for roads & bridges, though
    debate rages about their efficacy. The nat'l avg. for a gallon of unleaded
    in America is $2.44/gal.
