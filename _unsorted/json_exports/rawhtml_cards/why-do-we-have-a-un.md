    HOMECOMING…

    ===========


    at The United Nations

    ---------------------


    Once a year, 193 nations meet under one roof, where each country has one
    seat & one vote, for one big face-to-face “dance”.


    Why the UN General Assembly matters (and why it doesn’t).

    > “WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED  

    > to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our
    lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and  

    > to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights…”

    > 

    > The UN's founding Charter signed in 1945. Pres. Roosevelt believed an
    international body would help prevent future world wars; Congress agreed &
    approved America's membership.

    General Assembly: General Debate

    --------------------------------


    *   Tuesday: One huge meeting where every leader gets to speak.

    *   Brazil gave first speech in 1947 & that tradition continues. USA, the
    host country, speaks second.

    *   In reality, very little substantial decisions happen during this time,
    BUT it allows for informal conversations between leaders that can have a
    lasting impact.

    What To Watch For:

    ------------------


    *   **Pres. Trump’s speech on Tues.** In the last year, the U.S. arranged a
    historic summit w/North Korea & withdrew from Iran Nuclear Deal.

    *   S. Korea will reportedly deliver a **secret msg**. to U.S. from NoKo: a
    condition of nuclear disarmament.

    *   Pres. Trump will chair UN Security Council meeting Wednesday. Topic of
    discussion? Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   America pays for 20% of the UN’s total budget. Last year: **$1.2B**

    *   We pay more because of a formula in the UN charter tied to country size
    and wealth.

    *   Critics say the UN doesn’t achieve its goal aimed at bringing world
    peace and actually works against America’s interests; Gallup poll = majority
    of Americans agree the UN is not helping solve problems.

    current & future members of the UN Security Council. \*Permanent\* member

    countries serve 2 year terms.
