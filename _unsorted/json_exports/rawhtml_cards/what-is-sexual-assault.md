    The Truth Of This Term

    ======================


    In the last few years, we’ve heard this term often, and applied to various
    situations, but what is the definition of “**sexual assault**“?


    **Court of Law v.A Court of Public Opinion**
card_2:
  card_text: "> “The term a\x1Csexual assaulta\x1D means **any nonconsensual sexual act** proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.”\n> \n> U.S. Justice Department on what constitutes \"sexual assault\" under federal law. The definitions of \"sexual assault\" and \"sexual misconduct\" vary by state."

    Let’s Clear This Up:

    --------------------


    *   Prof. Christine Ford has accused Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh nominee
    of **sexual assault**.

    *   Despite her allegations, she hasA **not** filed a criminal complaint.

    *   The Senate Judiciary cmte is **NOT** a court of law & they will not
    decide if a sexual assault happened. Instead, they vote on whether Kavanaugh
    should be considered for SCOTUS.

    Some in the media have chosen to use the umbrella term "sexual misconduct"
    to refer to the accusations against Kavanaugh; misconduct includes, but is
    not limited to assault. Thank you to our SmartHER reader who asked for the
    definition. Keep the questions coming. We are here to help!
