    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   California: **world’s 5th largest economy**, others may follow suit.

    *   Female quotas exist in European countries like Norway, Germany &
    France;A **CA law is a 1st for U.S**.

    *   25% of California’s publicly heldA corporations don’t have women on
    their boards.

    *   Several studies point to better company performance with females on the
    board.

The question is can you make that preference & will it hurt men?a\x1D\n> \n> Jessica Levinson, Loyola Law School professor, on why the new California law may be vulnerable to a court challenge. Critics argue it may lead to unqualified candidates receiving the role, simply due to their gender. That said, several studies point to better company performance with females on the board."

    Something to Consider

    ---------------------


    80% of the largest 3,000 companies headquartered in California are
    incorporated (formed) in Delaware.


    Critics of California’s new law say corporations are governed by laws of the
    state in which they are incorporated, not where the main office is based –
    and this law will cause confusion & unnecessary fines.

    Companies like Apple & Facebook don't yet meet the requirement, set to take
    effect in the coming years. What do you think of this new law? A precedent
    or a problem?
