    Why Is It A Hot Topic Now?

    --------------------------


    *   Leading Democrat politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders & Rep. Alexandra
    Ocasio-Cortez are “**Democrat Socialists**” advocating for medicare for all
    & higher taxes on rich for the greater good.

    far left or “socialist.”
