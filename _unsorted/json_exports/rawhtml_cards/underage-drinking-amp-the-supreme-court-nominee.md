    > “I drank beer with my friends. Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too
    many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did
    not drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted
    anyone.”

    > 

    > Judge Brett Kavanaugh testifying before the Senate Judiciary Cmte. As he
    points out in his testimony, the drinking age in Maryland during his youth
    was 18; In current context "underage drinking" refers to anyone younger than
    21.

    Something To Consider

    ---------------------


    > “Underage youth who drink are more likely to carry out or be the victim of
    a physical or sexual assault after drinking than others their age who do not
    drink.”

    > 

    > National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism that states other risks
    include drinking & driving accidents, suicides and drowning.

    The most recent data available showed a slight decline in underage drinking;
