    Why it Matters

    --------------


    Deal creates America’s first true **luxury fashion** **conglomerate**.
    (Tapestry, which owns Coach, Kate Spade & Stuart Weitzman, is more
    mid-to-high-range.)


    America has the **largest apparel market in the world**, but has yet to
    produce a global, multi-brand company like European names Gucci or Christian
    Dior.
