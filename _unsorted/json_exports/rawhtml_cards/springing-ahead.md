    3 Things To Know About Daylight Saving Time (DST)

    -------------------------------------------------


    1.  Not intended to make longer days for farmers, but rather to help
    conserve energy used for light/heat (coal) during WWI.

    2.  The need for DST has always been a topic of debate. Today, about 70
    countries observe DST – that’s less than 40% of world.

    3.  Daylight saving time lasts 8 months. Standard time lasts 4 months.

    ORIGINS

    -------


    *   Federal gov’t mandated daylight saving time (DST) in 1918 during
    **WWI**, & again during **WWII**.

    *   **1966:** Congress standardized DST start & end dates requiring
    observing states to be in sync, but allowed states to opt out.

    *   **2005:** Congress re-set the start of DST to the 2nd Sunday in March &
    set the end for the 1st Sunday in November.

    Did You Know?

    -------------


    **States are not required to observe DST, but congressional approval is
    required to keep year-round daylight saving time**


    *   Nine states have passed laws to keep year-round (permanent) daylight
    saving time, which await Congress’ approval.

    *   Two states – Arizona (except Navajo territories) and Hawaii – as well as
    five major U.S. territories, don’t observe DST & keep year-round standard
    time.

    > _“I prefer Daylight Savings over Standard but in the end what I really
    want is to end this stupid twice a year time shift. Let’s #LockTheClock_“

    > 

    > Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who has introduced two federal bills since 2018 to
    eliminate the time shift and make daylight saving time permanent. President
    Trump has also voiced his support for keeping year-round daylight saving
    time.

    Changing our clocks was controversial from the beginning with complaints
    about BIG gov't. According to a 2019 poll by the Associated Press, less than
    a third of people like switching the clocks twice each year. What would you
