    Tech’s “Death Disruption”

    -------------------------


    *   **Next Big Thing?** Silicon Valley start-ups currently investing
    millions on the use of young blood to heal, or even reverse, signs of aging
    like memory loss.

    *   **How It Works:** Blood transfusions from a young person to an older
    person.

    *   Most promising research done on mice, not conclusive for humans.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    **Side Effects:** Some believe young blood may cause cells to multiply
    uncontrollably (how cancer starts).


    **Unknowns**: **Cost, dosage, frequency** and **quality control**. One U.S.
    clinical trial offered teenage blood to elderly at $8K/treatment, but with
    no peer review or control study, some questioned company’s proclaimed
    positive results.

    Young blood research focuses on the internal - it won't erase wrinkles. But
    "vampire facials" use the same blood therapy often used by athletes to
    repair muscles in an attempt to reverse the signs of aging. Is this the next
    logical step in the anti-aging industry?
