    HOW IT CAME TO BE:

    ------------------


    *   Many presidents and their families had Christmas trees INSIDE the White
    House.

    *   On **Christmas Eve 1923,** Pres. Coolidge became the first to light a
    tree on the outside lawn, starting an **annual tradition**. Middlebury
    College in VT, his home state, donated a balsam fir.

    *   2,500 electric bulbs lit the 48-ft tree in front of a crowd of 3,000.

    *   **Host**: National Park Service & its non-profit National Park
    Foundation

    *   **Tree:A** From 1924 – 1953 live trees were used, then cut trees were
    used until 1973. Live trees have been used ever since.

    *   **Decorations**: Family company, Hargrove Inc., has decorated the tree
    since 1954; Earl Hargrove would fix light bulbs, climbing the tree dressed
    as Santa.
