    Why We Do It:

    -------------


    *   A royal tradition adopted in America. Started with Sec. of State Henry
    Clay in 1852. Today, the decision to bestow the honor is made by Congress.

    *   Previously, 11 U.S Presidents have lain in state: Presidents Ford,
    Reagan, Johnson, Eisenhower, Hoover, Kennedy, Taft, Harding, McKinley,
    Garfield, & Lincoln

    Pres. Lincoln’s “Support”

    -------------------------


    *   Catafalque: a frame that supports a coffin (cat-e-falk).

    *   Pres. Lincoln’s catafalque from 1865 has held most of the coffins that
    have lain in state.

    *   The catafalque has had minor restorations since 1865 (retrofitted to
    hold larger coffins, drapery replaced), but for the most part, it remains
    like the original.

    Lie in \*State\* vs \*Honor\*

    -----------------------------


    *   Average citizens cannot “lie in state”A as that honor is reserved forA
    gov’t & military officials.

    *   Private citizens “lie in honor.”

    *   To date, only four Americans have “lain in honor” at the U.S. Capitol:
    Rev. Billy Graham, two police officers killed during an attack on the U.S.
    Capitol & Rosa Parks (only woman to lie in state or honor).

Bush.”\n> \n> President Trump declared Dec. 5, the day of Pres. H.W. Bush's Washington D.C. funeral, a national day of mourning and ordered flags flown half-staff for 30 days from his day of passing."

    D.C. funeral on Wednesday. On Thursday, Pres. Bush will be laid to rest in
    Texas next to his beloved wife, Barbara, and his daughter Robin who died at
    age 3.
