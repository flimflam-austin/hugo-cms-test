    What You Should Know:

    ---------------------


    *   U.S. has a consistent bombing campaign vs. al-Shabaab (al-Qaeda’s arm in
    Somalia); **airstrike killed 3 terrorists this week.**

    *   U.S. dropped 31 bombs in Somalia in 2017; this year’s # of airstrikes
    likely the**A same or more.**

  card_text: "Why al-Shabaab Matters:\n-----------------------\n\n> a\x1CThey’ve been able to **kill very high numbers** and you didna\x19t see that five years ago. Theya\x19ve been able to actually **overrun bases at times**. The danger is as African Union forces draw down, they may **retake major urban areas**. I think therea\x19s a good chance of that.a\x1D\n> \n> Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, Senior Analyst, Foundation for Defense of Democracies"

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    While U.S. airstrikes against al-Qaeda increased over the last 2 years in
    Africa (al-Shabaab in Somalia, & al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in
    Yemen), they have dropped against al-Qaeda in Pakistan, a key area for
    America’s longest war: Afghanistan.

    Al-Qaeda (AQ) Adjusts

    ---------------------


    *   After 17 years at war, our enemies learn lessons.

    *   AQ moved deeper into urban areas in Pakistan where drones will not
    strike.

    *   AQ returned to Afghanistan. Osama Bin Laden instructed his followers to
    do so.

    *   Afghanistan “home” to arguably more terrorist groups now than in 2001:
    AQ, Taliban and ISIS.
