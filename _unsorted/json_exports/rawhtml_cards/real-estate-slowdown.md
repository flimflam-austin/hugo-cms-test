    REALTY CHECK

    ============

    U.S. housing markets.** Is it the latest sign of a broader real estate
    slowdown?

  card_text: "What To Know:\n-------------\n\n> a\x1CThe increase in foreclosure starts is **not just a one-month anomaly** in many local markets given that July represented the third consecutive month with a year-over-year increase in 33 metro areas, including Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, Detroit, San Diego and Austin.”\n> \n> Daren Blomquist, ATTOM Data Solutions SVP, a property data firm"

    Why it Matters

    --------------


    The Great Recession was triggered largely by the U.S. housing bubble
    bursting in 2007 after years of lenders giving out risky mortgages.


    Our current lending environment has changed, but one property data company
    says “some loosening” of lending standards has put risk back into the
    market.

    Cause For Concern?

    *   **Rising Mortgage Rates:** 30-year fixed 4.5% vs. 4% at start of 2018.

    *   **Homebuilding Slows:A** hit a 9-month low in July and has yet to
    significantly rebound.
