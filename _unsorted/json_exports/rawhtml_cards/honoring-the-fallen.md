    BIG PICTURE

    -----------


    *   Coalition combat missions (U.S. & NATO) ended in 2014, but approx.
    15,000 U.S. soldiers remain in Afghanistan supporting and training Afghan
    troops.

    *   The Trump administration has allowed the military to operate more freely
    to target terrorists, but also reportedly wants to negotiate a “peace deal”
    with the Taliban.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    > The Taliban now control more of Afghanistan than any other time during
    America’s longest war; al Qaeda remains a close ally of the Taliban.

    > 

    > _“Al Qaeda remains a threat. Its operatives are fighting in more countries
    around the world today than was the case on 9/11.”_

    >
