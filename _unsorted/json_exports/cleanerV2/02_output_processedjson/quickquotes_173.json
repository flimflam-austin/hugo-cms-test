Dogs and cats can also transmit the bacteria via fleas.</li> <li>The plague is treatable with antibiotics, but it can still be fatal.&nbsp; According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html#cases\">CDC,</a> there are seven human cases on average each year. In 2015, there were two human cases of the plague in California – both recovered.</li> <li>El Dorado County Public Health Officer Dr. Nancy Williams <a href=\"https://www.edcgov.us/Government/hhsa/pressreleases/2020/Pages/El-Dorado-County-Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague.aspx\">cautioned</a> that although extremely rare, the plague is “<em>naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County. It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”</em></li> </ul> ",
