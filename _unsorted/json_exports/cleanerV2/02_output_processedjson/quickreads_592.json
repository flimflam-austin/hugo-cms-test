Moodya\u0019s Analytics economist Adam OzimekA findsA that when you measure slack using the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate, wages are growing at a pace you would expect.Or consider a simpler calculation: Roughly speaking, wages grow if workers are more productive and if overall prices are increasing. Productivity growth has been lower this cycle than in the past, and based on its performance wage growth is only slightly slower than youa\u0019d expect.These are compelling arguments, but Ia\u0019m not sold. Wage growth is slower than wea\u0019d expect, and the reason is something of a mystery. Some combination of all the factors wea\u0019ve discussed is probably the culprit. This is good news, because it means that a healthy rate of wage growth is likely in the future. But leta\u0019s hope the future arrives sooner rather than later.</li> </ul>"
