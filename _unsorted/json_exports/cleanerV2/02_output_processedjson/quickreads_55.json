  "body": "  <p>A note f<em>rom our founder, Jenna Lee Babin, adapted from the SmartHER Podcast.</em></p> <p>Hey Guys!</p> <p>Happy July 4th!</p> <p>And a very happy anniversary to my husband, Leif Babin. We married July 4th weekend, 2011. I think back to that time now and shake my head. I had no idea Ia\u0019d be living down the road from where we walked down the aisle right outside of Austin Texas. Ita\u0019s funny the twists and turns of life, isna\u0019t it? History teaches us that as well.</p> <p>Just the other day, I visited a cute little local store.A I got kicked out of the coffee shop across the street because of shorter summer hours, so I thought “what the heck?” and went into the store, simply for a\u001cresearcha\u001d purposes. I walked out with two very cool wooden signs.</p> <p>They have the same driftwood color frame and beige weathered background. But one square reads in very clear typewriter font: Land of the free. The other reads: Home of the brave.</p> <p>And when I saw them, I had to have them. I just loved seeing those two sentences in isolation.</p> <p>Land of the free.</p> <p>Home of the brave.</p> <p>I read those sentences and thinka|”YES. Thata\u0019s right! Thata\u0019s a <strong>fact</strong>.”</p> <p>But its interesting to think about another fact – that neither expression existed for some of the most important people who made that fact a reality. The Star Spangle Banner didn’t exist untilA the war of 1812, years after the end of the Revolutionary War.</p> <p>And this makes me think back on something I heard the famous historian David McCullough talk about and thata\u0019s perspective – remembering the perspective of the individuals at the time and place in history.A Ia\u0019ll explain.</p> <p>I made a trip to a special historic landmark a few weeks ago.</p> <p>A place where timing and weather and luck and perservance all converged on a snowy, windswept frigid night more than 200 years ago.</p> <p>It was that night, Christmas 1776, when the idea of celebrating Americaa\u0019s independence in the heat of summer would seem absolutelya|totallya|insane. Ridiculous, in fact.</p> <p>That night, General George Washington led a group of men across the Delaware and into history.</p> <p>You might remember reading something about Washingtona\u0019s Crossing of the Delaware but I know I needed a refresher.</p> <p>We remember the American Revolution from a point of pride. Thats because we know what happened. We know we won. We know we are free. But divorce yourself from that thought for a moment.</p> <p>Those men (and women), fighting so many years ago, did not have the benefit of knowing the future. Thata\u0019s what David McCullough pointed out. They knew they faced potential death, starvation, imprisonment. They didn’t think of fireworks and hotdogs and beach vacations. They didn’t know how great they would be. They just kept on going into the unknown with an idea and it worked.</p> <p>They were so brave.</p> <p>The American Revolutionary War lasted 7 yearsa|.7 years. Every time I read that fact, I thinka|”Really?” Yes. 7 years. We tend to think of it as shorter but a lot happened in those years – many people died and many doubts raised in the founding of our great nation.</p> <p>And by a simple twist of fate or luck or divine intervention, America didn’t lose. But we had a few very near misses. And thata\u0019s why Washingtona\u0019s Crossing marks a pivotal moment in all of our stories because it changed the momentum.</p> <p>Listen to the story of told by Clay Craighead, marvelous historian, at Washington Crossing State Park. I had to go there in person. I had to stand on the ground. In a day, when electronic records can vanish, ita\u0019s important to stand where history happened. We recorded this interview in Claya\u0019s office where hea\u0019s worked for 30 years. Youa\u0019ll hear a little bit of the working office in the background – I apologize for that, but its sitting in someonea\u0019s office, where theya\u0019re comfortable, that you get the best perspective and the most passion – youa\u0019ll hear that in Clay’s voice. Therea\u0019s a moment in our conversation where Clay mentions bloody footprints in the snow, an image Ia\u0019ll never forget, especially this July 4tha|in the land of the free. And the homea|of the brave.</p> <p>Here’s the link to the podcast:</p> <p><a href=\"http://smarthernews.libsyn.com/smarther-news-ep6-independence-day\">http://smarthernews.libsyn.com/smarther-news-ep6-independence-day</a></p> <p>Happy Independence Day,</p> <p>With love from SmartHER News,</p> <p>Jenna</p> "
