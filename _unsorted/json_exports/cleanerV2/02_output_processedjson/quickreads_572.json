Today, it’s trading below **$50/barrel**.\n*   **Why?** There’s **too much oil**. U.S. crude inventories have **climbed 10-straight weeks** to the highest level in a year, just as concerns grow over a **global economic slowdown** with less oil demand."

Falling prices may weigh heavily on an industry that now represents a larger share of the U.S. economy.\n\nWhile lower oil prices boost consumers, ultimately energy producers will be forced to cut back, laying off workers which may send prices ultimately spiking higher."
