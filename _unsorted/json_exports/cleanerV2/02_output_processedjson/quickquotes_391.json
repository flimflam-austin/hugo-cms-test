On Monday, Moderna joined Pfizer, becoming the second company to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA for its COVID-19 vaccine. <ul> <li>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said&nbsp; he expects the U.S. will have 40 million doses of vaccines available for high-risk and vulnerable populations, such as frontline workers, by the end of the year. However, vaccines are not expected to be widely available until next year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>",
