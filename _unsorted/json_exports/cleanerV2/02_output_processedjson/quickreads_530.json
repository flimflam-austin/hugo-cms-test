The message to them is not to be scared of milk, or to limit its consumption, and to encourage children of all ages to keep drinking it freely.”\n> \n> Dr. Mona Eissa, The University of Texas Health Science Center, on a separate study that researched obese children & dairy consumption, which found obese children who drank \\*any\\* milk had better blood sugar control."
