    "cardText": "The Experiment\n--------------\n\n*   **Who:** Researchers infected “Aedes aegypti” male mosquitoes with bacteria making them sterile.\n*   **Where:** Released 3M in Australia.\n*   **What:** Sterile male mosquitoes didn’t bite or spread disease, and when they mated with wild females, eggs didn’t hatch – effectively wiping out population.\n*   **Why:** The mosquitoes spread diseases like dengue fever & zika."

    "cardText": "Why it Matters\n--------------\n\n*   Majority of mosquitoes don’t spread diseases, BUT 3 most deadly (found globally) are responsible for **17% of infectious disease transmissions**.\n*   Researchers say this experiment **offers a potential new solution**.\n*   In May, the CDC warned the US is **“not fully prepared”** for these **widespread & difficult to control diseases.**"

Many other insects and small fish feed on them and the loss of that food source would cause their numbers to decline as well. Anything that feeds on them, such as game fish, raptorial birds, etc. would in turn suffer too. Mosquitoes can be wiped out but the ecological damage that would be necessary (draining swamps/wetlands, applying pesticides over wide areas), along with strict regulatory enforcement, would make eradication not worth it unless there was a very serious public health emergency.</em></li> </ul>"
