  "body": " <ul> <li>&nbsp;Both of the people who had a severe reaction to the vaccine dose (anaphylactoid reaction), had a history of allergic reactions in the past and carried an epi-pen.</li> <li><em>“Certainly, vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions. In the United States, roughly one of every 1.4 million doses of vaccines is complicated by a severe allergic reaction.”&nbsp;</em>Offit wants to learn what component of the vaccine caused the reaction.</li> <li>The top UK health authority issued a new warning about giving the vaccine to anyone with a history of “severe allergic reactions” of any kind.</li> <li>Dr. Ollett sits on the FDA advisory panel that voted 17-4 to recommend the FDA issue emergency use authorization to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.</li> <li>“Pfizer’s trial protocol shows that people with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) “to any component of the study intervention” were not able to take part.” (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/09/health/covid-vaccine-allergies-health-workers-uk-intl-gbr/index.html\">CNN</a>)</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The roll-out of the Pfizer COVID-19 was the largest vaccine distribution campaign in UK history.

Both are recovering well.”</em> Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/09/health/covid-vaccine-allergies-health-workers-uk-intl-gbr/index.html\">READ MORE</a></p> ",
