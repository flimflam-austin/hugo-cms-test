It will require sacrifice but save many thousands of lives.</em></p> <p><em>We believe the choice is clear. We can continue to allow the coronavirus to spread rapidly throughout the country or we can commit to a more restrictive lockdown, state by state, for up to six weeks to crush the spread of the virus to less than one new case per 100,000 people per day.</em></p> <p><em>That’s the point at which we will be able to limit the increase in new cases through aggressive public health measures, just as other countries have done.
