    "cardText": "Background\n----------\n\n*   Ohio procedure allows the state to remove voters **from the registry** who **haven’t voted for 2 years** & **fail to respond to mailed notices** confirming they are still eligible to vote **w/in four years**.\n*   SCOTUS ruled against a challenge to this policy.\n*   Ruling directly impacts **6 other states w/similar policies**A (GA, MT OK, OR, PA & WV)."

  "card_3": {
    "cardText": "Why It Matters\n--------------\n\n**Federal law prohibits states from removing voters from registration solely because of their failure to vote.**\n\nThe Supreme Court said Ohio’s procedure does NOT violate the law because “it removes registrants only when they have failed to vote **and have failed to respond to a change-of-residence notice**.”"

    "cardText": "HE Said / HE Said\n-----------------\n\nDNC Chair Tom Perez called the ruling “**an attack on democracy**” and a “**power grab by a Republican Party that wants to make it harder for people to vote**.”\n\nOhio’s Republican Sec. of State Jon Husted called it a\u001c**a victory for electoral integrity**.a\u001d Husted is running for lieutenant governor in November."

    "cardText": "Remember: Ohio is a swing state; it can swing republican or democrat in state/national elections. That's part of the reason why this case has heightened attention, as the voting rolls are HIGHLY important for both parties.\n\n[view sources](https://smarthernews.com/18-06-14-supreme-court-voting-case/)"
