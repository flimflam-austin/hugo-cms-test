Trump, United Nations General Assembly, Sept 25, 2018"

    "cardText": "What To Know:\n-------------\n\n*   Pres. Trump hitting a hot button issue in Iran: struggling economy.\n*   High unemployment, falling currency & major drought.\n*   Iran invested heavily in Syria, Iraq & Yemen to advance interests.\n*   Nationwide protests organized to challenge Iranian leadership.\n*   More U.S. sanctions to come = more potential internal strife in Iran."

    "cardText": "> “OPEC and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I dona\u0019t like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. **Not good.**“\n> \n> Pres. Trump referred to America as the \"largest energy producer anywhere on the face of the Earth\" - a fact that U.S. oil production now outpaces all other nations."

  "card_5": {
    "cardText": "What To Know:\n-------------\n\n*   OPEC = Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n*   Members like Saudi Arabia & Russia supply nearly 50% of total world’s oil supply.\n*   OPEC “stabilizes” oil markets by agreeing to certain production output; that supply impacts price.\n*   Pres. Trump wants OPEC to keep oil supply up, so prices stay down. **OPEC may not agree**."
  },
  "card_6": {
    "cardText": "Connecting The Dots\n-------------------\n\n*   Iran is part of OPEC.\n*   Expected U.S. sanctions will prevent some Iranian oil from hitting the market.\n*   Less global supply = potentially higher oil prices.\n*   Higher oil prices may impact U.S. economy. This is why Pres. Trump wants OPEC to ramp up production, in part, to cover U.S.-imposed loss of Iranian oil."
