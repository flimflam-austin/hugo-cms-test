    "cardText": "> a\u001cThe most promising aspect of our new approach is that **we can prolong the opioid pain relief effect for many months with a single injection** of our new bio-pharmaceuticals. This could benefit chronic pain sufferers in many ways and also avoid the terrible consequences of continuous use of opioids.a\u001d\n> \n> Bazbek Davletov, study author and chair of the biomedical science department, University of Sheffield"

  "card_4": {
    "cardText": "Why It Matters:\n---------------\n\n*   Results showed reduced pain in mice up to 23 days.\n*   No clinical trials yet, though researchers are working toward that goal.\n*   **Each day 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose**.\n*   In October 2017, Pres. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency."
