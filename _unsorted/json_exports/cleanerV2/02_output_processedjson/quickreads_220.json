    "cardText": "3 Things To Know About Daylight Saving Time (DST)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  Not intended to make longer days for farmers, but rather to help conserve energy used for light/heat (coal) during WWI.\n2.  The need for DST has always been a topic of debate. Today, about 70 countries observe DST – that’s less than 40% of world.\n3.  Daylight saving time lasts 8 months. Standard time lasts 4 months."

    "cardText": "ORIGINS\n-------\n\n*   Federal gov’t mandated daylight saving time (DST) in 1918 during **WWI**, & again during **WWII**.\n*   **1966:** Congress standardized DST start & end dates requiring observing states to be in sync, but allowed states to opt out.\n*   **2005:** Congress re-set the start of DST to the 2nd Sunday in March & set the end for the 1st Sunday in November."

  "card_4": {
    "cardText": "Did You Know?\n-------------\n\n**States are not required to observe DST, but congressional approval is required to keep year-round daylight saving time**\n\n*   Nine states have passed laws to keep year-round (permanent) daylight saving time, which await Congress’ approval.\n*   Two states – Arizona (except Navajo territories) and Hawaii – as well as five major U.S. territories, don’t observe DST & keep year-round standard time."

Marco Rubio (R-FL) who has introduced two federal bills since 2018 to eliminate the time shift and make daylight saving time permanent. President Trump has also voiced his support for keeping year-round daylight saving time."
