  "body": "<ul> <li>Asian giant hornets are about two inches long, and as their name suggests, they are not native to the U.S.</li> <li>According to the <a href=\"https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31875\">Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA),</a> they are “<strong>the world’s largest hornet and a predator of honey bees and other insects.” </strong>Despite their name, they actually kill only a few humans each year, but a small group of Asian giant hornets is capable of killing a whole honey bee hive in just hours.</li> <li>After five confirmed sightings of Asian giant hornets in Whatcom County dating back to December 2019, WSDA <a href=\"https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31545\">announced</a> in July that it successfully trapped two – the <a href=\"https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31413\">first</a> Asian giant hornets ever detected via a trap in America. Their next goal was to trap more and locate the nest.</li> <li>Earlier this week, WSDA announced it found the nest in a tree near Blaine. WSDA located the nest after attaching tracking devices (<a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2020/10/7-photos-show-how-researchers-vacuumed-out-murder-hornet-nest-in-washington-state-what-they-found.html\">via dental floss!</a>) to three hornets.&nbsp; On Saturday, the WSDA posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3411169195635580\">video</a> to Facebook showing workers vacuuming the Asian giant hornets from the nest.</li> <li>On Monday, WSDA will hold a press conference to announce what happens next.</li> </ul>",
