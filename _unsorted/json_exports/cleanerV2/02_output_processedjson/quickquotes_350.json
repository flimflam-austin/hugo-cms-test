On Monday, a windstorm moved through parts of the state. The high winds mixed with the dry vegetation added ammunition to existing fires and ignited news ones, requiring thousands to flee from their homes.</li> <li><strong>LATEST:</strong> Officials don’t yet know how many lives have been lost, though <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9OUT6QNK9k&amp;ab_channel=OregonPublicHealthDivision\">Gov. Brown</a> said that at least hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The state’s chief deputy fire marshal explained there many areas where firefighters cannot yet reach due to the extreme conditions.</li> <li><strong>WHAT’S NEXT: </strong>Several areas across the state are under mandatory evacuation orders, with more orders expected, as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/9002178ddd7d935c75f6ff666d044d16\">Gov. Brown</a> warned the “<em>next several days are going to be extremely difficult</em>.”</li> <li><strong>BIG PICTURE:</strong> &nbsp;It’s not just Oregon – fires are ravaging parts of Washington also. Extensive fires in the area are rare due to the Pacific Northwest’s cool and moist climate. As of Wednesday, there are 27 large fires burning over 900,000 acres in the Northwest, according to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLMOregon/status/1303725828157521920\">U.S. Bureau of Land Management</a>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Access The Latest Information On Oregon’s Wildfires <a href=\"https://wildfire.oregon.gov/\">HERE</a></strong></p> ",
