Friday is the worst day to buy gas in 19 states, having the most expensive average.<br> a\u001cThough there is variation in daily gas prices across different states, the consensus is that the earlier motorists fill-up during the week, the better,a\u001d says Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. a\u001cFollowing Monday, Sunday is the cheapest day to fill-up. A Conversely, Thursday follows Friday as the most expensive day to fill-up.a\u001d<br> a\u001cConsumers are missing a big opportunity at the pump when it comes to saving time and money,a\u001d says DeHaan. a\u001cOur data shows that most motorists are filling up on not only the most expensive day, but the busiest. Having a tank of gas last until Sunday or even Monday each week can collectively save drivers $2.6 billion, and spare the headache of not being able to find an available pump.a\u001d<br> </em></li> <li><strong>Higher gas prices are eating into Trump tax cut, trimming spending by Americans:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/energy/2018/05/10/gas-prices-oil-prices-after-iran-deal-trump-tax-cuts/594719002/\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/energy/2018/05/10/gas-prices-oil-prices-after-iran-deal-trump-tax-cuts/594719002/</a></li> <li><strong>Exclusive: OPEC’s new price hawkA Saudi Arabia seeks oil as high as $100 – sources</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-oil-exclusive/exclusive-opecs-new-price-hawk-saudi-arabia-seeks-oil-as-high-as-100-sources-idUSKBN1HP1LB\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-oil-exclusive/exclusive-opecs-new-price-hawk-saudi-arabia-seeks-oil-as-high-as-100-sources-idUSKBN1HP1LB</a></li> </ul> "
