All of these products are at risk for contamination due to the human and/or mechanical handling that is required to get them into a bag. The labels on the salad bags boast that they are a\u001ctriple washeda\u001d and ready to serve.</em><br> <em>They lure you into thinking that this is some sort of a sanitized food product. It is my gestalt that as we create more food items, especially the ready-made foods, we are further exposing ourselves to food-borne illnesses. During these outbreaks, the goal is to pinpoint the source of the infection. However, the bagged lettuce you bought because you didna\u0019t want to chop a fresh head may be a mix of multiple heads of lettuce from multiple growers. Tracking the source is almost impossible.<br> ****<br> </em><em>From my perch in Texas, this is how I see these latest outbreaks. The checks and balances to keep contaminated fecal waste out of the food chain has been corrupted.
