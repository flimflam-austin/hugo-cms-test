  "body": "<ul> <li>In March, the FDA approved emergency use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate for treating COVID-19, allowing the anti-malarial drugs to be used in ways in which they had not yet been tested for. At the time, there were reports and limited studies indicating that some COVID-19 patients appeared to recover more quickly using the treatment.</li> <li>In April, the FDA warned against treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to the risk of heart rhythm problems.</li> <li>In May, Pres. Trump faced criticism when he announced he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure.</li> <li>On Monday, based on results from a large, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients that found hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine showed no benefit for speeding recovery or decreasing the likelihood of death, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization.</li> <li>The revocation of the emergency use authorization does *not* mean the drugs will be removed from the market – it just means that the anti-malarial drugs are still available for their approved uses, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus.</li> </ul>",
