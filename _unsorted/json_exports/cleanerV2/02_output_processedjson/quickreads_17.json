Crowley, a white man who began his congressional career in the late 1990s as a centrist, New Democrat (though he was more reliably liberal in recent years), lost to a 28-year-old Latina a\u0014 a first-time candidate who describes herself as a a\u001cDemocratic socialista\u001d and favors single-payer health care.</em></p> <p><em>Sanders, rejected in the primaries in New York two years ago, was quick toA embraceA Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday night, suggesting her campaign focused on some of the same themes his did in 2016. Former HUD Secretary JuliA!n Castro was also quick out of the gate toA congratulateA her.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/27/2018-primary-election-results-analysis-678811\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/27/2018-primary-election-results-analysis-678811</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>2018 primaries: Key takeaways as Democrats get a shock and Trump triumphs</strong>A <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/27/2018-primaries-key-takeaways/736563002/\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/27/2018-primaries-key-takeaways/736563002/</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> "
