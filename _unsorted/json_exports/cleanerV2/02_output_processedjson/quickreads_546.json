    "cardText": "BIG PICTURE\n===========\n\n*   Between 2001-2015, overall # of reported crimes on college campuses dropped by 34% EXCEPT the # of forcible sex offenses increased by 262%.\n*   Some say victims need broad guidelines; others say the broad guidelines cast too wide of a net. The Dept of Ed. believes the latter. Proposed rules would apply for K-12 & higher education."

    "cardText": "Proposed New Rules\n------------------\n\nA year after rescinding Obama-era rules on how schools handle sex misconduct allegations citing federal overreach, the Dept. of Ed. revealed proposed rules, which:\n\n*   Require a higher **standard of proof** for evaluating accusations.\n*   Allow accused students to **cross-examine** their accusers (using a representative)."

    "cardText": "> a\u001c… something like **one in five women will be victims of sexual assault on campuses,** and cases of false accusations are exceedingly rare. But when you hear folks in the current administration talk about issues of sexual harassment or assault, what one hears from them is **the implication that false accusations are a rampant problem and that is false.**a\u001d\n> \n> Fmr.
