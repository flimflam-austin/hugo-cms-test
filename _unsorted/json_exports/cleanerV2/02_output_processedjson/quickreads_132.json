They have prepared their own memo in response, but Republicans voted to block its immediate public release.<br> The drama comes as special counsel Robert Mueller also is investigating whether the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia during the campaign and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry by, among other actions, firing Comey. Republicans have intensified their pressure on the Justice Department as Muellera\u0019s probe has moved closer to Trumpa\u0019s inner circle.<br> Trump has been telling confidants in recent days that he believes the memo will validate his concerns that the FBI and Justice Department conspired against him, according to one outside adviser familiar with those conversations but not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a93bad5f2d964cf7ad7231eeb80a9a42/FBI-in-public-fight-with-Trump-over-releasing-Russia-memo\">https://apnews.com/a93bad5f2d964cf7ad7231eeb80a9a42/FBI-in-public-fight-with-Trump-over-releasing-Russia-memo</a></li> <li><strong>PRESS RELEASE: DEVIN NUNES:</strong> Regardless, ita\u0019s clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign.

He did so even thoughA he had not readA the classified documents that the memo characterizes and refused to allow the FBI to brief the committee on the risks of publication and what it has described as a\u001cmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memoa\u0019s accuracy.a\u001d The party-line vote to release the Republican memo but not a Democratic response was a violent break from the committeea\u0019s nonpartisan tradition and the latest troubling sign that House Republicans are willing to put the presidenta\u0019s political dictates ahead of the national interest.<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rep-nuness-memo-crosses-a-dangerous-line/2018/01/31/cbdabedc-0696-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html?utm_term=.d6bc4bbd2000\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rep-nuness-memo-crosses-a-dangerous-line/2018/01/31/cbdabedc-0696-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html?utm_term=.d6bc4bbd2000</a></li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> "
