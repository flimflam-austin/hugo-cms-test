  "body": " <ul> <li>The Taylor family’s call for a special prosecutor comes after Kentucky’s Attorney General Daniel Cameron <a href=\"https://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=AttorneyGeneral&amp;prId=967\">released</a> 15 hours of grand jury recordings last week. <ul> <li>The grand jury recordings were released pursuant to a court order in a case filed by an anonymous grand juror asking for their release in response to Cameron’s public remarks about <a href=\"https://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=AttorneyGeneral&amp;prId=963\">why</a> the grand jury decided there was insufficient evidence to charge any police officers in connection with the killing of Breonna Taylor. <ul> <li>On March 13, the 26-year-old EMT was shot multiple times by police inside her Louisville, KY home after plain clothes police officers conducting a drug investigation entered her home using a ‘no-knock’ warrant, meaning they were not required to identify themselves before entering.</li> <li>Police said they returned fire after Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot which hit one of the officers in the thigh.</li> <li>Walker said the police knocked, but did not identify themselves, leading him and Taylor to believe they were robbers, which is why he fired his gun. The police said they identified themselves.</li> <li>One of the officers was charged – but not in connection with Taylor’s death. Brett Hankison (no longer an officer) was charged with wanton endangerment, a class D felony punishable by up to 5 years.&nbsp; He is accused of endangering the lives of Taylor’s neighbors – a male, a pregnant female, and a child – because he fired into the apartment with no clear line of sight (this is also the reason he was fired).</li> </ul> </li> <li>The recordings add detail, but do little to resolve the conflicting accounts. <strong>Listen <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-58776580/sets/breonna-taylor-tapes-hear-grand-jury-audio-recordings-from-case\">HERE</a></strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>In the<strong><a href=\"https://act.bencrump.com/a/breonna-taylor\"> open letter</a> </strong>shared over the weekend one day after the grand jury recordings were released, Crump said “<em>It is now <strong>clearer than ever that this was a case where you decided early on that your office would never actually prosecute</strong> against officers Cosgrove, Mattingly and anyone else responsible for the unlawful death of Breonna Taylor</em>” ahead of asking for Cameron to recuse himself<em> “and have the Kentucky Prosecutors Advisory Council appoint a special prosecutor who is willing to allow a grand jury to actually do its job, deliberate over all possible charges and render a decision on a True Bill for each.”</em></li> </ul> <ul> <li>Speaking to local media about the case ahead of the release of the grand jury recordings last week, Cameron <a href=\"https://www.wdrb.com/news/grand-jury-not-presented-with-murder-charges-against-2-officers-in-breonna-taylors-death-ag/article_d6fb9ade-0279-11eb-8dd6-d7e39a63357a.html\">explained</a> that his office did not present any murder charges to the grand jury, saying that it was “<strong><em>not appropriate</em></strong>.” With respect to the two officers who were not charged, Cameron said “<strong><em>Because they were fired upon, they returned fire. I think that’s been lost a lot in this conversation. They were justified</em></strong>.” <ul> <li>On Tuesday, Cameron responded to Crump’s call for him to recuse himself, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/breonna-taylor-daniel-cameron-kentucky-ag-black-republican-mob-mentality-megan-thee-stallion\">stating</a>: “<em>This is the Ben Crump model. He goes into a city, created a narrative, cherry-picks facts to prove that narrative, creates chaos in a community, misrepresents the facts and then he leaves with his money and asks the community to pick up the pieces,… It is terribly irresponsible on his part to push such narratives, such falsehoods.</em>“</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Read&nbsp;SmartHER News’ backgrounder on the Breonna Taylor Case <a href=\"https://www.smarthernews.com/article/breonna-taylor-update/\">HERE</a></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",
