That acceleration gives President Trump a stronger hand as he contemplates more tariffs and takes an increasingly confrontational approach with China, Canada, Mexico and other trading partners.<br> Economists have raised their growth estimates for the second quarter to an annualized rate of nearly 5 percent, more than double the pace of the previous period. Some economists say the figure could hit 3 percent for the full year, a level last reached in 2005.<br> As growth slows in Europe, China, Japan and elsewhere, the United States finds itself at the top of the global economy. The United States is also less exposed to the fallout from an escalating trade war since it does not rely on exports as much as other countries. It all gives Mr. Trump leverage with world leaders, potentially forcing them to make concessions.But his threats could also backfire. Economists warn that the presidenta\u0019s clout is limited and that his attacks on the trading system could dampen the outlook not just in other countries but also domestically.</li> <li><strong>Trump jabbed first, and now world hits back:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-jabbed-now-world-hits-back-trade-fight-56070456\">https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-jabbed-now-world-hits-back-trade-fight-56070456</a></li> <li><strong>Trumpa\u0019s Tariffs Could Deliver a Sizable Hit to Chinaa\u0019s Economy:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/trump-s-tariffs-could-deliver-a-sizable-hit-to-china-s-economy\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/trump-s-tariffs-could-deliver-a-sizable-hit-to-china-s-economy</a></li> <li><strong>Goldman Sachs: Buckle up.
