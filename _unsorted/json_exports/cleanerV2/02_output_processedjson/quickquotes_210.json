  "body": " <ul> <li>Former Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe was charged with 11 crimes including felony murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The felony murder charge carries a<strong> potential death sentence or life without parole</strong>.&nbsp; The aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge carries up to a 20-year sentence. Rolfe also faces charges for kicking Brooks, shooting his taser at Brooks while he was running away, failing&nbsp; to render aid to Brooks, and for shooting his firearm in the direction of bystanders <ul> <li>Last Friday, Brooks was killed after Atlanta police attempted to arrest him. The police were responding to a complaint that a man had fallen asleep in his car, blocking traffic at a Wendy’s drive-thru lane. After Brooks failed a sobriety test, the police attempted to arrest him and a struggle ensued. Brooks grabbed an officer’s taser and ran away while pointing it at the officer. Rolfe fired his taser at Brooks before shooting him twice in the back with his firearm.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In discussing the charges, the District Attorney said Brooks “did not pose an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury.” He also said that although Brooks was “slightly impaired” that his demeanor was “almost jovial” and that at no time during the 41 minute and 17 second encounter did he display any aggressive behavior.</li> <li>The other officer, Devin Brosnan, who stepped on Brooks’ shoulder after he was shot, was charged with three counts, including aggravated assault. He is cooperating with the prosecution in the case against Rolfe. The District Attorney said Brosnan will become one of the first police officers to testify against another officer in his own department. Brosnan’s lawyers said, <em>“To be clear – Devin is cooperating with the Fulton County District Attorney’s investigation….He has NOT agreed to be a ‘state’s witness’ or to testify in any court hearing or to plead guilty to any charge.”</em></li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Both the officer who kneeled on the neck of George Floyd,&nbsp; and the officer who shot Rayshard Brooks, face felony murder charges.</li> </ul> <p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=\"ttps://apnews.com/f3c3747e6d8c0bd63ba7c57c6d363868\">CLICK HERE</a></p> <p>You can watch DA Howard make his statement <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/da-paul-howard-expected-make-announcement-possible-charges-rayshard-brooks-shooting/EZ5T5RIXTRHO3O5LYBX6W3VN5U/\">HERE</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",
