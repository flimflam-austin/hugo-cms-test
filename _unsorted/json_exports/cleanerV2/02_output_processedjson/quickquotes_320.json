  "body": " <ul> <li><strong>THE LATEST:&nbsp;</strong>Moderna is the second biotech company to announce promising clinical trial results for a COVID-19 vaccine in recent days. This data is&nbsp;according to a preliminary analysis by an independent data &amp; safety monitoring board. <ul> <li>Last week, <a href=\"https://smarthernews.com/hope-and-reality-covid19/\">Pfizer</a> announced the results of its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial show it’s over 90% effective. <ul> <li>Like the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna’s is an MRNA vaccine. To date, no MRNA vaccine has been approved for human use.</li> <li>Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna’s can be stored and shipped at normal refrigerator temperatures. It also has a longer “shelf life.” One of the challenges to developing an effective vaccine is simply logistics – getting the treatment to patients, safely and effectively.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>ABOUT THE TRIAL: </strong><a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy\">Moderna</a>‘s vaccine trial involves 30,000 adult participants in the U.S. Half received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart and the other half received a placebo 28 days apart. 95 participants got COVID-19, but only five of those participants were in the group that received the vaccine; 90 received the placebo.</li> <li><strong>FYI:</strong> Moderna’s president Dr. Stephen Hoge said that although the news provides hope that a vaccine will help stop COVID-19, Moderna alone can’t solve COVID-19 and many vaccines are needed.</li> <li><strong>BIG PICTURE:</strong> Pfizer and Moderna have yet to apply for emergency use authorization, but they’re expected to do so soon. Officials say a vaccine could be available for vulnerable populations by the end of the year, and more widely available as early as April.</li> </ul> ",
