Whitmer, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GovGretchenWhitmer/videos/346049466647915\">squarely blamed President Trump</a> for “<em>fomenting division</em>” and encouraging hate groups, like the two militia groups accused of plotting against her. The President responded later in the day during a Fox News interview, stating that his administration’s Justice Department is the one filing charges against those allegedly behind the plot.</li> <li><strong>BIG PICTURE:</strong> Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said there’s been “<em>a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies,</em>” noting that these groups often seize on moments of civil unrest to advance their agenda and recruit new members. “<em>This is more than just political disagreement or passionate advocacy, some of these groups’ mission is simply to create chaos and inflict harm upon others</em>,” she said.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",
