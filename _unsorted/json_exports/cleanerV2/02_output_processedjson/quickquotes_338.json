  "body": "<ul> <li>Here’s the report in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/\">The Atlantic</a>: <strong>Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’ The president has repeatedly disparaged the intelligence of service members, and asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades, multiple sources tell&nbsp;The Atlantic.</strong></li> <li>The President denies the report, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-conference-september-7-2020/\">calling it “a hoax.”&nbsp;</a><br> <em>“The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself — which I don’t read, but I hear it’s just totally anti-Trump; he’s a big Obama person, he’s a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It’s a totally made-up story…And it’s a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There’s nobody — and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.”&nbsp;</em></li> <li>Here’s the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-bolton-denies-atlantic-report-trump-soliders-france\">full interview</a> with Ambassador John Bolton:<em> “According to what that article said, the president made disparaging remarks about soldiers and people buried in the cemetery in connection with the decision for him not to go to the ceremony that was planned that afternoon, and that was simply false. “I can’t prove the negative that he never said those things,” Bolton told host Martha MacCallum. “The president has a habit of&nbsp;disparaging people.&nbsp;He ends up denigrating almost&nbsp;everybody that he comes in&nbsp;contact with whose last name is&nbsp;not Trump.”</em></li> <li>Here’s a perspective from a Gold Star husband and Green Beret who met with the President <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-came-dover-after-my-wife-was-killed-fighting-isis-ncna1239425\">READ</a><em>“….when I read the anonymous allegations this week that President Trump spoke disparagingly of our troops, I knew they simply weren’t true — or were taken completely out of context in order to hurt him before the election.</em><em>President Trump’s actions have shown our troops more respect than any president in my lifetime. His use of decisive military force only when absolutely necessary, combined with his reluctance to use the military as the sole tool of foreign policy, is not only good and smart, but the sign of utmost respect for the lives of our troops.”</em></li> <li>Here’s a perspective from a former advisor to the President: <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/09/07/exclusive-zach-fuentes-top-aide-to-john-kelly-denies-atlantic-story-about-trump/\">READ HERE</a><br> <em>“I don’t know who the sources are. I did not hear POTUS call anyone losers when I told him about the weather. Honestly, do you think General Kelly would have stood by and let ANYONE call fallen Marines losers?”</em><em>He specifically also stated that he believes The Atlantic’s sources “are unlikely first hand accounts.” </em><em>“They are conflating those people from something the day after,” Fuentes said.</em><em>Fuentes also told Breitbart News he is upset that Trump has been speaking negatively about Kelly. </em><em>“On a separate note, I am disappointed to see POTUS talk about General Kelly so negatively in the middle of being accused of saying negative things about the military,” Fuentes said. “If anyone understands selfless service, it’s General Kelly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></li> </ul>",
