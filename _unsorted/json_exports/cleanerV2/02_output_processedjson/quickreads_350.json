Washington was quite a shopper)."

Delivery generally takes about 45 minutes. In 1985, Florida senator Paula Hawkins tore through the text in a record-setting 39 minutes – while in 1962 West Virginia senator Jennings Randolph, savoring each word, consumed 68 minutes. </em><em>At the conclusion of each reading, the appointed senator inscribes his or her name and brief remarks in a black, leather-bound book maintained by the Secretary of the Senate. Early entries in the notebook were typically brief explanations of the practice, accompanied by signature and date. Often, several&nbsp;entries appeared on a single page; in more recent years, entries have grown more elaborate and have included&nbsp;personal stories&nbsp;or comments on contemporary politics and policy. In 1956, Minnesota senator Hubert Humphrey stated that every American should study this memorable message. “It gives one a renewed sense of pride in our republic,” he wrote. “It arouses the wholesome and creative emotions of patriotism and love of country.” The book’s first entry bears the signature of Joseph Foraker, a Republican senator from Ohio, and is dated February 22, 1900.
