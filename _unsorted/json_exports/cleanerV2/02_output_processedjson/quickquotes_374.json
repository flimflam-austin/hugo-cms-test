Ideally a “healthy” labor market has high labor market participation AND a lower unemployment rate because people have jobs.</li> <li>The economy added jobs – a reversal from the previous month recording job losses.</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The economy remains “down” 10 million jobs since March/April last year when America effectively “shut down” to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Questions remain about how best to recover these jobs (economic stimulus? a changing economy?) and how that impacts the health of the U.S. economy overall.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jec.nr0.htm\">Official report from the US gov’t.</a></p>",
