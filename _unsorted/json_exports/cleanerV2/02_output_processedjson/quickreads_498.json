Last year: **$1.2B**\n*   We pay more because of a formula in the UN charter tied to country size and wealth.\n*   Critics say the UN doesn’t achieve its goal aimed at bringing world peace and actually works against America’s interests; Gallup poll = majority of Americans agree the UN is not helping solve problems."
