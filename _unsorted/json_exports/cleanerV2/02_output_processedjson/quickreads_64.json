This is one of the things Americans hate about Washington a\u0014 that politics has become the end, not the means.A Most AmericansA a\u0014 whether in Laredo, Tex., or Queens, N.Y. a\u0014 do not embrace the emotional and absolutist views of immigration on the extreme right or on the extreme left. They simply want to secure the countrya\u0019s borders, to eliminate the inefficiencies in the system and to treat fairly the undocumented people who were brought here as children and have committed no serious crimes.<br> </em><em><br> None of these interests is being served in Washington right now. Ita\u0019s just a screaming match. The American public must demand more of its leaders and those who seek that honor. In a democracy, governing requires compromise, compromise requires the acceptance of political risk, and political risk requires political courage.
