Trump is no longer in office and impeachment is intended for those in civil positions (federal gov’t).</li> <li>Leading Democrats argue a key point to impeachment is not *just* for current officials, but for those who have left office, as a way to ban them from future positions.</li> <li>After Senators were sworn in for the impeachment trial, Republicans attempted to pass a motion to declare the impeachment trial unconstitutional. It failed.</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> In order to convict an official in an impeachment trial, the Senate would need 67 votes or two-thirds majority. The Senate is currently 50 lawmakers voting Democrat, and 50 voting Republican. The early forecasting favors Pres. Trump NOT being convicted – HOWEVER, the Senate trial will include evidence and arguments from both sides.&nbsp; The proper part of the trial will begin Feb. 9.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/26/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-begin-senate-mulls-witnesses/6660660002/\">GOOD BACKGROUNDER HERE</a></p> <p>Here’s the two sides of the argument about whether to impeach or not impeach Pres.
