As seen pictured aboveA Dr. Noah Philip, Director of Psychiatric Neuromodulation at Providence VA, treats a patient using TMS therapy.TMS treatments are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat depression. An electromagnet, essentially a wire wrapped around a solid coil, is charged with electricity and then placed over specific points on the skull.A This creates a very powerful magnetic field that can positively affect brain cells. While TMS is typically used to treat depression, there is growing evidence that it can help Veterans with PTSD.</em><br> <a href=\"https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/49058/veterans-ptsd-treated-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/\">https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/49058/veterans-ptsd-treated-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/</a></li> <li><strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd.shtml\">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd.shtml</a></li> <li><strong>What Is PTSD?:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/what-is-ptsd.asp\">https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/what-is-ptsd.asp</a></li> <li><strong>Women, Trauma, and PTSD:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/women/women-trauma-and-ptsd.asp\">https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/women/women-trauma-and-ptsd.asp</a></li> <li><strong>NISVS Infographic:<br> </strong><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/infographic.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/infographic.html</a></li> </ul>"
