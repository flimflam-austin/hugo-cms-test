Est. 1 out of 100 cancer diagnoses will be brain cancer; it's also the second most common form of cancer in children (behind Leukemia)."

Researchers are investigating new ways to deliver drugs to brain tumors, including pumps that release a continuous, slow flow of chemotherapy or targeted drug therapies to a tumor. This type of treatment is called convection-enhanced delivery (CED).<br> Another type of therapy uses technology called tumor treating fields (Optune) to deliver electric fields to the brain, which can help stop the proliferation of cancer cells. Optune is a wearable, portable device and is used in combination with temozolomide to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults.<br> Implanted, biodegradable wafer therapy (Gliadel) relies on an implanted disc to release chemotherapy to tumor tissue that remains after surgery. And in nanoparticle therapy, particles with an unusually high surface area carry chemotherapy across the blood-brain barrier directly to a tumor.</li> <li><strong>New approach to destroying deadly brain tumors:A </strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170613102056.htm\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170613102056.htm</a></li> <li><strong>Novocure – the maker of the Tumor Treating Fields Therapy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.novocure.com/mechanism-of-action/\">https://www.novocure.com/mechanism-of-action/</a><br> <strong>Optune.com </strong>(the device made by Novocure – good stats here)<strong>:<br> </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.optune.com\">https://www.optune.com</a></strong></li> <li><strong>How is Immunotherapy Changing the Outlook for Patients with Brain Cancer?:A </strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearch.org/immunotherapy/cancer-types/brain-cancer\">https://www.cancerresearch.org/immunotherapy/cancer-types/brain-cancer</a></li> </ul> "
