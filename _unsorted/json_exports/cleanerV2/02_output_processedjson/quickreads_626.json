Amber alerts for kidnapped children or tornado warnings often use this system.\n*   You can opt out of receiving Amber Alerts but NOT for this national alert."

    "cardText": "Some argue this is a great tool for communicating with the public during dire times; others say it presents a risk for hacking or abuse.
