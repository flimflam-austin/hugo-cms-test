It’s Free Now in Some Cities<em>:</em></strong><em><br> While the idea to supply sunscreen to people during the summer may seem like a no-brainer, it hasn’t been without its bumps. As a a\u001ccity focused on wellness,a\u001d Boston wanted its dispensers to dole out “all-natural” products, said Girard. That caused a problem: The sunscreen was so thick that it struggled to come out of the dispensers. When it did, it was often entirely too much and ended up being rubbed on statues and benches.A Eventually, they perfected the product — and the dispensers — using a sunscreen with a higher amount of glycerin</em>.<br> <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/gov-sunscreen-dispensers-miami-boston.html\">http://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/gov-sunscreen-dispensers-miami-boston.html</a></li> <li><strong>Free Sunscreen:<br> </strong><em>You can buy a product that is labeled as higher than SPF 30, but ita\u0019s almost always a waste, and potentially harmful. SPF 15 filters out aboutA 93 percentA of UV-B rays. SPF 30 filters out approximately 97 percent. SPF 50 filters out approximately 98 percent. SPF 100A mightA get you to 99. The problem, though, is the psychology of the larger number. Above 30, the difference is essentially meaningless, and higher SPFs do not last longer than lower SPFs a\u0014 but they do tend to make people feel invincible. We put on the “more powerful” sunscreens and then suddenlyA thinkA we’re Batman or some other superhero who can stay out in the sun indefinitely. But no sunscreen is meant to facilitate prolonged exposure of bare skin to direct sunlight.</em><strong><br> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/when-it-comes-to-choosing-a-sunscreen-everyone-is-getting-burned-by-their-own-ignorance/396173/?utm_term=2018-07-05T16:17:51&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=atlantic-health&amp;utm_source=twitter\">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/when-it-comes-to-choosing-a-sunscreen-everyone-is-getting-burned-by-their-own-ignorance/396173/?utm_term=2018-07-05T16:17:51&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=atlantic-health&amp;utm_source=twitter</a></li> <li><strong>Whata\u0019s Wrong With High SPF?<br> </strong><a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/whats-wrong-with-high-spf/#.W03p-NhKjzI\">https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/whats-wrong-with-high-spf/#.W03p-NhKjzI</a><strong><br> </strong></li> <li><strong>Cancer Society:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2017/cancer-facts-and-figures-2017.pdf\">https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2017/cancer-facts-and-figures-2017.pdf</a></li> <li><strong>Major nonprofit behind this FREE sunscreen movement:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.impactmelanoma.org/our-work-practice-safe-skin/areas-utilization\">https://www.impactmelanoma.org/our-work-practice-safe-skin/areas-utilization</a></li> </ul> "
