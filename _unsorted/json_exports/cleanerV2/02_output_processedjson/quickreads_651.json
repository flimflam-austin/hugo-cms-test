    "cardText": "> “Measles can be so contagious that you can be in a room, and if youa\u0019re susceptible, two hours after someone with measles left, and still get the disease.”\n> \n> Dr. Alan Melnick, director of public health for Clark County, the site of the measles outbreak in Washington state. Most of the cases are children under 10. The vaccination rate for school age children is 78%, much lower than recommended 90-95% to create community or \"herd\" immunity."

    "cardText": "The Vaccine In America\n----------------------\n\n*   Public vaccine introduced 1968.\n*   1 dose given until an outbreak among vaccinated kids occurred in 1989, prompting doctors to recommend a 2nd dose.\n*   Current recommendation: children get their first dose of the vaccine at 12-15 months & then between ages of 4-6 years old.\n*   1 dose = 93% effective.\n*   2nd dose = 97% effective."

    "cardText": "Why Now?\n========\n\n> “These resurgences (of measles) have been attributed to various causes, including **refusal to vaccinate**, **incomplete vaccination series**, **waning immunity**, and **imported cases.**“\n> \n> Medical researcher & author CL Ventola."
