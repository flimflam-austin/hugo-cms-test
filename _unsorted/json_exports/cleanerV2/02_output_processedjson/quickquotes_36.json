Here’s the full exchange:</li> </ul> <blockquote><p>MARK LEVIN: <em>Dr. Fauci, let me ask you a question. You’ve been doing this a long time. Have you ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat? A health threat?</em></p> <p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: <em>Well, we’ve never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think is one of them.</em></p> <p><em>I mean, we’re talking about all-hands on-deck is that I, as one of many people on a team, I’m not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was. I have been devoting almost full time on this — almost full time.</em></p> <p><em>I’m down at the White House virtually every day with the Taskforce. I’m connected by phone throughout the day and into the night and when I say night, I’m talking twelve, one, two in the morning. I’m not the only one. There’s a whole group of us that are doing that. It’s every single day.</em></p> <p><em>So I can’t imagine that that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously, we’re fighting a formidable enemy — this virus. This virus is a serious issue here.</em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li>Dr. Fauci noted that he has never publicly endorsed any political candidate and that he doesn’t plan to do so now.</li> <li>In response to the controversy surrounding the ad, on Tuesday Pres. Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1315414353105960960\">said</a> “<em>They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words. We have done a “phenomenal” job, according to certain governors. Many people agree…And now come the Vaccines &amp; Cures, long ahead of projections!”</em></li> </ul> ",
