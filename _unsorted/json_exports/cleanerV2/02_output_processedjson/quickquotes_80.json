The backlogs are so pronounced that some managers have reached out to colleagues in hopes of diverting mail shipments to nearby facilities. But often, those places are full, too. Meanwhile, packages sit on trucks for days waiting for floor space to open so the loads can be sorted.</em></li> <li>Why? The pandemic has stressed the postal system, forcing more customers online and led to thousands of postal workers unable to work due to illness.</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: In the immediate, some mailing packages and online orders will not arrive in time for Christmas. Big picture: the delays highlight the inefficiencies of the US Postal Service that has struggled to compete with private carriers like UPS.</li> <li><strong>Something to consider:</strong> <em>For the week of Dec. 6, FedEx delivered 93.9 percent of its parcels on time, UPS delivered 96.1 percent, and the Postal Service, 87.5 percent.</em></li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/21/usps-delays-christmas/\">Read More From The Washington Post</a></p> <p>Here’s the official statement from USPS (they have an alert about delivery on their <a href=\"https://www.usps.com/\">homepage</a>)</p> <p><em>“We are working as quickly as possible to process the mail.</em></p> <p><em>The U.S. Postal Service, similar to the broader shipping sector, continues to face near-term pressure on service performance across categories as it manages through a historic record of holiday volume this season. <strong>This negative impact is compounded by the temporary employee shortage due to the&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;surge, as well as ongoing capacity challenges with airlifts and trucking for moving this historic volume of mail.</strong></em></p> <p><em>The Postal Service’s 644,000 employees continue to work diligently to address issues and remain focused on delivering the Holidays and beyond for the nation. Amid the historic volume, the Postal Service continues to flex its network, including making sure the right equipment is available to sort, process and deliver a historic volume of mail and packages this holiday season. Our entire Operations team, from collections, to processing to delivery, worked throughout this past weekend and continues to work around the clock to address the historic volume. We are accepting all volume that is presented to us which is adding to our challenges.”</em></p> <p><em>U.S. POSTAL SERVICE</em></p> ",
