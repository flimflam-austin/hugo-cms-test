  "body": "<ul> <li>Sec. Stoltenberg held a press conference with President Trump during a 70th anniversary summit of NATO in London.</li> <li>He said since 2016 member nations have added more than $100B to their defense budgets.</li> <li><strong>Why This Matters</strong>: When Pres. Trump came into office one of his main complaints with NATO was member nations not contributing enough to defense spending and depending on the United States for their security.</li> <li>29 nations make up the defense alliance, mostly focused on security in Europe.<em>“We are making real progress, most importantly on the burden sharing.&nbsp; And your leadership on defense spending is having a real impact.&nbsp; Since 2016, Canada and European allies have added $130 billion more to the defense budgets, and this number will increase to 400 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.</em><em>This is unprecedented.&nbsp; This is making NATO stronger.&nbsp; And it shows that this Alliance is adapting, responding when the world is changing.</em> <p><em>We will, of course, also address a wide range of other issues, including the fight against terrorism, arms control, our relationship with Russia, the rise of China.&nbsp; And NATO is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to change when the world is changing.&nbsp; That’s exactly what we are doing again.&nbsp; And the fact is that we are doing more together in this Alliance now than we have done for many decades.”</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-nato-secretary-general-stoltenberg-11-meeting-london-united-kingdom/\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-nato-secretary-general-stoltenberg-11-meeting-london-united-kingdom/</a></p></li> </ul>",
