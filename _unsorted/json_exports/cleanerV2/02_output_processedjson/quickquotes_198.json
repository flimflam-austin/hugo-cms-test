  "body": " <ul> <li><strong>25th Amendment: </strong>Under the 25th Amendment, the Vice President and a majority of the President’s Cabinet may declare the President unfit, allowing the Vice President to become acting president. <ul> <li>On Tuesday, the House debated a <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/1.10.21_25thAmendmentResolution%5BFOR%20INTRO%5D.pdf\">resolution</a> calling on the Vice President to invoke the 25th based on Pres. Trump’s inability to “<em>successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office</em>” because of his words and actions surrounding the U.S. Capitol riot.</li> <li>The resolution is expected to pass, but it does not have power to force the Vice President to invoke the 25th.</li> <li>Explaining his decision, the Vice President wrote that “<em>the 25th Amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th in such manner would set a terrible precedent</em>.”</li> </ul> </li> <li><b>Impeachment: </b>On Wednesday, the House is expected to vote in favor of an <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/articles-impeachment-trump-xml/b0422e292cebafda/full.pdf\">article of impeachment</a> charging Pres.&nbsp; Trump with “incitement of insurrection,” citing his words and actions regarding the U.S. Capitol riot. <ul> <li>At least three House Republicans are expected to vote in favor of impeachment: Reps. Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), and John Katko (R-NY).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> ",
