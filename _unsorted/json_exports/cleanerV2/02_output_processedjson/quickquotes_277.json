Biden did not mention any other country by name, instead focusing on domestic issues such as combating extremism and false information that are “manipulated or manufactured.”</li> <li>He repeated a common line from his campaign, that he will not be President for only those who voted for him, but for all Americans.</li> <li>Pres. Biden spoke of writing “the next great chapter” in America’s story – “an American story of decency and dignity.”</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Inaugural address is part of tradition. U.S. presidents, at times, will map-out immediate and long term goals President Biden spoke for about 20 minutes and laid the foundation for a busy first afternoon post-speech where <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-president-executive-actions-covid-19-climate-change-immigration/\">he will sign executive orders reversing some of the orders Pres. Trump put in place</a>.&nbsp; <p><em>Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth. A raging virus. &nbsp;Growing inequity. The sting of systemic racism. A climate in crisis. America’s role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways, but the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we’ve had. Now we’re going to be tested. Are we going to step up, all of us? &nbsp;It’s time for boldness, for there’s so much to do. &nbsp;</em></p></li> </ul> <p>This is an interesting version of the inaugural address, annotated by NPR writers – the annotation offers some editorial input so keep that in mind! But interesting nonetheless! <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/01/20/956922884/bidens-inaugural-address-annotated\">CLICK HERE</a></p>",
