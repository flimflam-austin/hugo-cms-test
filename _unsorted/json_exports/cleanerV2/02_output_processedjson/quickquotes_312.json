Health officials say this will streamline the vaccination process by improving access to people in rural areas and developing countries.</li> <li>The <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial\">data</a>, based on an ongoing study with nearly 44,000 participants in the U.S. and seven other countries, suggests it is “<strong>66% effective overall in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination.</strong>” <ul> <li>72% effective in the U.S.</li> <li>57% in South Africa (where one of the new mutant strains is most prevalent).</li> </ul> </li> <li>&nbsp;The J&amp;J vaccine usess the same technology as the recently approved Ebola vaccine, which is different than the mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna.
