The project included Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder.</em></p> <p><em>Within the Silicon Valley crowd, basic income had become a fashionable idea for addressing collective angst over the social consequences of technology. The masters of innovation were becoming stupendously rich via creations poised to make working people poor, replacing human labor with robots. Basic income was posited as compensation.</em></p> <p><em>The Economic Security Project was keen to demonstrate another aspect of basic income a\u0014 its potential to help communities facing problems in the here and now. It was shopping for a city that could serve as staging ground.</em></p> <p><em>Ms. Fostera\u0019s group agreed to deliver $1 million for a new project a\u0014 SEED, for Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration.</em></p> <p><em>The sum was nowhere near enough to finance universal anything. It would not cover the basics of any critical need.</em></p> <p><em>Still, it could produce a glimpse of what a guaranteed cash program might look like.</em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Who is the Economic Security Project?A </strong><br> <a href=\"https://economicsecurityproject.org\">https://economicsecurityproject.org</a></li> </ul>"
