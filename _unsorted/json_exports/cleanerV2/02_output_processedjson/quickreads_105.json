  "body": " <p><strong>The singular Oprah Winfrey on braving the elements, the way forward for women, and why, for now at least, she doesna\u0019t want to be president</strong></p> <p><strong>byA LAURA BROWN</strong></p> <p>OW:A [Laughs] I actually saw a mug the other daya\t…a\tI thought it was a cute mug. All you need is a mug and some campaign literature and a T-shirt. Ia\u0019ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not. And so ita\u0019s not something that interests me. I dona\u0019t have the DNA for it. Gaylea\u0014who knows me as well as I know myself practicallya\u0014has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, a\u001cWhena\u0019s Oprah going to run?a\u001d So Gayle sends me these things, and then shea\u0019ll go, a\u001cI know, I know, I know! It wouldna\u0019t be good for youa\u0014it would be good for everyone else.a\u001d I met with someone the other day who said that they would help me with a campaign. Thata\u0019s not for me.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/celebrity/oprah-winfrey-march-cover\">http://www.instyle.com/celebrity/oprah-winfrey-march-cover</a></p>"
