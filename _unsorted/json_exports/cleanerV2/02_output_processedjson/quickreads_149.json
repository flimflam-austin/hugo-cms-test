The Japanese also consume less meat and animal fats than Westerners in general and eat more fish.</em></p> <p><em>Japanese women over 50 also drink much less alcohol than their male folk, and hardly ever smoke, which means that they are half as likely to develop stomach or liver cancers compared to men. Drinking less alcohol also reduces the risk of developing colorectal and breast cancers for women</em>.a\u001d</p> "
