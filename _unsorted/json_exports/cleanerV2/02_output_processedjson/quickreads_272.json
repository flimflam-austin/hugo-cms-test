    "cardText": "DACA Drama\n==========\n\n*   Supreme Court will not hear an expedited legal appeal on DACA.\n*   Trump administration requested The Supremes look at case when lower courts halted President Trump’s unwinding of the program.\n*   DACA kicked back to lower courts. **Fate & timeline unknown.**\n\nFlip Here",

  "card_2": {
    "cardText": "**D**eferred **A**ction for **C**hildhood **A**rrivals:\n\nThe 2012 Obama-era policy granted provisional work permits and temporary protection from deportation for nearly 800,000 young people brought to U.S. illegally as kids, but NO pathway to citizenship."

  "card_3": {
    "cardText": "How We Got Here:\n----------------\n\n**Sept 2017:** President Trump announced repeal of DACA program & gave Congress until March 5th to come up with broader immigration reform.\n\n**January 2018:** California federal court issued a preliminary injunction halting repeal of DACA program & ordered gov’t to resume accepting DACA renewal applications."
  },
  "card_4": {
    "cardText": "Why It Matters\n--------------\n\n*   Supreme Court’s decision not to hear appeal early says nothing about the merits of the case or how court might ultimately rule.\n*   DACA recipients can continue to apply for DACA renewals while the California case works its way through the court system.\n*   March 5th deadline is moot; Pres. Trump cannot cancel program during ongoing court challenges."
