Investable assets include equities, investment funds, cash and bonds. ‘The fact that the wealth held by millionaires as a percentage of total wealth is increasing does not mean that the poor are getting poorer,’ Anna Zakrzewski, the reporta\u0019s lead author, said in an emailed statement. ‘What it means is that everyone is getting richer. Specifically, we believe that the rich are getting richer faster.'”</li> <li><strong>Being Generous Really Does Make You Happier:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://time.com/4857777/generosity-happiness-brain/\">http://time.com/4857777/generosity-happiness-brain/</a><br> “In a new study published in Nature Communications, researchers from the University of Zurich in Switzerland told 50 people theya\u0019d be receiving about $100 over a few weeks. Half of the people were asked to commit to spending that money on themselves, and half were asked to spend it on someone they knew.<br> The researchers wanted to see whether simply pledging to being generous was enough to make people happier. So before doling out any money, they brought everyone into the lab and asked them to think about a friend theya\u0019d like to give a gift to and how much they would hypothetically spend. They then performed functional MRI scans to measure activity in three regions of the brain associated with social behavior, generosity, happiness and decision-making. Their choicesa\u0014and their brain activitya\u0014seemed to depend on how they had pledged to spend the money earlier. Those who had agreed to spend money on other people tended to make more generous decisions throughout the experiment, compared to those who had agreed to spend on themselves. They also had more interaction between the parts of the brain associated with altruism and happiness, and they reported higher levels of happiness after the experiment was over.<br> Studies have shown that older people who are generous tend to have better health, says Tobler, and other research has indicated that spending money on others can be as effective at lowering blood pressure as medication or exercise. ‘Moreover, there is a positive association between helping others and life expectancy,’ he adds, ‘perhaps because helping others reduces stress.'”</li> </ul> "
