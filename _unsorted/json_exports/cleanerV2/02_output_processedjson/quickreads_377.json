Many years from now and well beyond the dates of this report, one could envision an environment when the longer, line-haul portion of truck freight movements are completed by autonomous trucks and local pick-up and delivery routes are completed by drivers. However, motor carriers should not count on this being an option for many years.</em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><strong>a\u0018What Does a Trucker Look Like?a\u0019 Ita\u0019s Changing, Amid a Big Shortage:<br> </strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/us/politics/trump-truck-driver-shortage.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/us/politics/trump-truck-driver-shortage.html</a></li> <li><strong>Truck driver shortage expected to get worse:A </strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.kvia.com/special-reports/truck-driver-shortage-expected-to-get-worse-industry-report-states/776186265\">https://www.kvia.com/special-reports/truck-driver-shortage-expected-to-get-worse-industry-report-states/776186265</a></li> <li><strong>Bureau of Labor Statistics: Heavy &amp; Tractor-trailer drivers:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm#tab-%201\">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm#tab-%20</a></li> <li><strong>Amazon Prime 2-day shipping guarantee confusion:</strong><br> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-two-day-shipping-guarantee-confusion-2018-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-two-day-shipping-guarantee-confusion-2018-5</a></li> </ul> "
