  "body": "<ul> <li>The President received a test for COVID-19 on Thursday after learning one of his top aides, Hope Hicks, also tested positive.</li> <li>He announced around <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1311892190680014849?s=20\">midnight on Twitter</a> that he and First Lady Melania Trump both tested positive as well. <em>“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”</em></li> <li>President Trump is 74-years-old.</li> <li>Here’s his earlier <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1311859538279239686?s=20\">tweet</a> before his own test result: <em>“Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible! The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”</em> <ul> <li>Hicks traveled with the president and members of his team throughout the past week, including on a trip on Wednesday, at times in close quarters. However, there is no way of knowing if she transmitted the virus to the President.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:&nbsp; </strong>President Trump’s age puts him at a higher risk for serious complications due to COVID-19. Nationwide, health experts continue to carefully watch a rise in COVID-19 cases, particularly in the Midwest, to see if the increase is temporary or a trend, heading into the critical fall months when flu will also be present. More than 1 million people have died from the illness (200,000+ in America); More than 7M infected.</li> <li><strong>UPDATES:</strong> <ul> <li>The Vice President’s press secretary confirmed via<a href=\"https://twitter.com/VPPressSec/status/1311997475226636291\"> tweet</a> that both Vice President Pence and the Second Lady tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday morning.
