  "body": "<ul> <li><strong>ABOUT:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884\">House</a> bill would (1) remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances, (2) authorize a sales tax on marijuana products, and (3) allow for federal courts to expunge prior marijuana convictions. <ul> <li>The House bill is technically “bipartisan” because one of its 93 cosponsors is Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz.</li> <li>The companion bill in the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2227\">Senate</a> was introduced in July 2019 by now Democratic VP candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).</li> </ul> </li> <li><b>BIG PICTURE: </b>Today, medical marijuana is legal in all but 17 states. 11 states and DC have legalized recreational marijuana, and 16 states have decriminalized possession of small amounts, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/clearing-criminal-records-for-cannabis-offenses.aspx\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</li> <li><strong>WHAT’S NEXT:</strong> Rep. Nadler told <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/04/marijuana-house-vote-federal-legalization-first-time/5678068002/\">USA TODAY</a> that the bill will likely receive unanimous support in the Democrat-controlled House when it votes later this month, but its fate in Republican-controlled Senate appears far less certain, with one Republican spokesperson telling <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/04/marijuana-house-vote-federal-legalization-first-time/5678068002/\">USA TODAY</a> there’s “no plan” to move ahead on the bill.</li> </ul>",
