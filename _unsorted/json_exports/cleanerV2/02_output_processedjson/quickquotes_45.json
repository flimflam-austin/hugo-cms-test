Right now, the deciding two Senate seats will be determined in a Georgia run-off election – results expected the first/second week in January. If the seats are won by Democrats, they will have majority in House and Senate allowing Dems greater ability to pass the aid packages they prefer. If Republicans win the seats, they will maintain the majority in the Senate and the two major bodies of Congress will be split (as they have been in recent years).</li> </ul> ",
