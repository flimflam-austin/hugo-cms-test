  "body": " <ul> <li>Over the past two months, the FDA has continued to warn consumers against using certain hand sanitizer products. <ul> <li>Some contain low levels of alcohol – the active ingredient in hand sanitizer. &nbsp;The CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html\">recommends</a> consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li> <li>Others contain dangerous levels of methanol (wood alcohol). &nbsp;Methanol can be toxic and even life-threatening. The FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use\">warns</a> that “<em>substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death</em>.”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Many, but not all of the products listed on the FDA’s list have been recalled. For that reason, the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-reiterates-warning-about-dangerous-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizers\">urges</a> consumers to avoid all hand sanitizer products from all of the manufacturers on the list. <ul> <li>View the FDA’s list of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use#products\">hand sanitizers consumers should not use</a>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> ",
