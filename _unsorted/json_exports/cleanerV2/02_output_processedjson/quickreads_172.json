This is a fabric with ink that heats up a\u0014A it’s weightless, it’s conductive and it’s immediate.”<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/22/exclusive-ralph-laurens-olympic-opening-ceremony-uniforms-wearable-mini-heaters/1045189001/\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/22/exclusive-ralph-laurens-olympic-opening-ceremony-uniforms-wearable-mini-heaters/1045189001/</a></li> <li><strong>Also a good read:A THIS PARKA KEEPS OLYMPIANS TOASTY WITH HEAT-CONDUCTING INK</strong>A The heated jacket works almost like an electric blanketa\u0014except instead of wires or coils sewn into the fabric, the heat comes through a special type of carbon and silver ink bonded to the jacket lining. (In true patriotic fashion, Ralph Lauren applied the ink in the shape of an American flag.) The ink conducts heat in the same way a wire would, and connects to a small battery pack sewn into the garment. When fully charged, the jacket itself stores up to 11 hours of heating time. Athletes can adjust the temperature up or down through a smartphone app; designers stress-tested the jacket inside of meat lockers to ensure that, on the highest setting, it could withstand temperatures as cold as 20 below zero.A <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ralph-lauren-conductive-heat-ink-parka/\">https://www.wired.com/story/ralph-lauren-conductive-heat-ink-parka/</a></li> </ol> "
