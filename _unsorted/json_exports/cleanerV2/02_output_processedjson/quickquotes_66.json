Important Context: As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/15/world/covid-coronavirus?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes – these areas had <em>“relatively few cases until recently.”&nbsp;</em></li> <li>An example of an area that had relatively few cases but is now experiencing notable rise in infections is Wyoming: <em>“I think honestly (a factor) is the fatigue of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures, in general…I totally understand, and I have the same feeling that we’re all sort of ready for this to be over and to be able to get back to normal life. Unfortunately, we’re just not there.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.wyomingnews.com/coronavirus/southeast-wyoming-grapples-with-record-covid-19-spike-in-recent-weeks/article_93c177de-7d46-54a6-9d34-9126ce49ec04.html\">Wyoming State Public Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist</a></li> <li>Officials are concerned that rising infections in the Midwest/Mountain West signal more infections to come nationally.</li> <li>Health experts are not only concerned about rising COVID-19 test results but also a rise in hospitalizations.</li> <li>Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/10/07/wisconsin-opening-field-hospital-as-covid-19-cases-surge/#37c7232159bc\">opened a field hospital</a> to handle the overflow of COVID-19 cases: <em>“We hoped this day wouldn’t come, but unfortunately, Wisconsin is in a much different, more dire place today and our healthcare systems are beginning to become overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 cases,” </em>Wisconsin’s Gov. Tony Evers.</li> <li>Perhaps more important than the rise in cases is the lack of any serious declines regionally.</li> <li><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Health officials wanted to begin the anticipated flu season with lower baseline numbers to ensure proper resources. No region has been spared from a COVID-spike, as the virus has spread in America from the Northeast and far West, to the Sunbelt, and now in the Midwest/Mountain West.</li> </ul> ",
