Given his importance to the political blife of the country, you have to imagine Sen. John McCain has gone through more of this pressure than most people faced with choosing whether to continue fighting terminal illness.</p> <p>Sen. John McCaina\u0019s family announced on Friday that he would stop treatment for glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer he was diagnosed with last year. In their statement, McCaina\u0019s family said the Arizona Senator has ‘surpassed expectations for his survival.A But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.’</p> <p>Making the decision about when to stop treatment is excruciating. ‘When you know that youa\u0019re losing the battle against cancer, you have to make sure you prepare for the worst,’ says Dr. Raja Flores, the chairman of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Mount Sinai Health System. ‘The toughest thing that Ia\u0019ve seen is when patients will continue to fight to the end because they feel that thata\u0019s what their family wants.’</p> <p>….</p> <p>Sen. McCain had been receiving treatment for his brain cancer since July 2017. The decision to stop comes after he has been absent from Washington for months. The McCain family highlighted the senatora\u0019s ‘usual strength of will’ when announcing his decision to discontinue his cancer fight.”</p></blockquote> "
