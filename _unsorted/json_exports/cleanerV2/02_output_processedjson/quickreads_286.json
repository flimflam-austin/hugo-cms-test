One measurea\u0014which passed in California and took effect there this montha\u0014would require anyone who makes a gun at home to register it and apply for a state-issued serial number. The Californian law also bans the sale or trade of homemade guns. But enacting a law and enforcing it are separate matters. Arrests for non-compliance are likely only after an untraceable gun is used to commit a crime. And with some 300m firearms in America, skirting the rules to acquire a gun is not difficult, regardless of how it was made. As one gun-control expert put it, a\u001cIta\u0019s a hell of regulatory challenge.</em>a\u001d<br> <b><b>A </b></b></li> </ul> "
