One estimate: You can get results in a few hours.</li> <li>The test received <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-yale-school-public-health\">emergency use authorization by the FDA.</a> It’s one of 5 saliva-tests that have received a green-light.</li> <li>The NBA helped fund this research and used the test on its players, staff.</li> <li>The difference between this test and others? You don’t need to special equipment, for example, a special tube to collect the saliva. It also doesn’t need one reagent or one specific machine to process the test but can use many, making it potentially accessible and cheap to process for both private citizens and labs. Grubuagh says he thinks it will cost labs approx. $10 to process.</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Quick COVID-19 tests may be one of the keys to identifying cases, even asymptomatic ones, and slowing transmission rates nationwide.

If these tests continue to show reliability and quick turnaround, this may make regular testing more possible so Americans feel a greater degree of comfort returning to work, school and play (knowing they themselves don’t have the virus, or friends/family/colleagues don’t).<br> .<br> Read more from Yale: <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/15/yales-rapid-covid-19-saliva-test-receives-fda-emergency-use-authorization\">https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/15/yales-rapid-covid-19-saliva-test-receives-fda-emergency-use-authorization</a></li> </ul>",
