    "cardText": "OH, BABY.\n=========\n\nAmerican women are having children at the LOWEST rate on record.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe number of babies born last year hit a **30-year low** despite a strong economy & a larger female population of child-bearing age – **dumbfounding researchers**."

    "cardText": "Why It’s Surprising\n-------------------\n\nLast year, the birthrate even **declined for women in their 30s**, a shocker after rates had been rising as more women delayed pregnancy.\n\nThe only group to see a **higher birthrate was women in their 40s**.\n\nBaby booms typically follow economic booms, but **the fertility rate hasn’t recovered since 2010.**"

    "cardText": "> “Every year I look at data & expect it will be the year that birthrates start to tick up, and every year we hit another all-time low. It’s one of the big demographic mysteries of recent times.”\n> \n> Kenneth Johnson, University of New Hampshire Demographer"
  },
  "card_4": {
    "cardText": "Why It Matters\n--------------\n\nFewer babies means **less young workers to pay into Social Security & Medicare** for an aging population.\n\nIt may also affect the workplace with **too few workers for jobs** that need to be filled.\n\nIn the U.S., declines in rates haven’t led to drops in population, mainly due to immigration."

    "cardText": "More than 3.8M babies were born in the U.S. last year, but last year's drop in the nation's birth rate (about 2%) is the largest drop since 2010. And while there's no need to be alarmed yet, researchers point to Japan's \"demographic time bomb\" on why this matters.
