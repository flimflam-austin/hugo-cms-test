    "cardText": "Why Now?\n--------\n\n**NFL:**A “It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case.”  \n**Something To Consider**: Americans are watching less TV overall & NFL viewership has declined by millions since 2015. Some viewers say they boycotted the NFL because of the players on-field protests."

Players who do appear on the field for the anthem must stand; if they dona\u0019t, their respective club faces a league-issued fine and teams can levy additional fines.a\u001cI do not like imposing any club-specific rules,a\u001d Johnson said. a\u001cIf somebody [on the Jets] takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players. I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer that they stand? Of course. But I understand if they felt the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that wea\u0019re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I dona\u0019t want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I wona\u0019t. There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, thata\u0019s just something Ia\u0019ll have to bear.a\u001d</li> </ul>"
