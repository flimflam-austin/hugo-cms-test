What is the difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day?A. Many people confuseA Memorial DayA and Veterans Day. Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. While those who died are also remembered,A Veterans DayA is the day set aside to thank and honorA ALL those who served honorably in the military – in wartime or peacetime. In fact, Veterans Day is largely intended to thankA LIVING veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served – not only those who died – have sacrificed and done their duty.</li> <li><strong>About the photo we used</strong>:A <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c31718/\">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c31718/</a></li> </ul> "
