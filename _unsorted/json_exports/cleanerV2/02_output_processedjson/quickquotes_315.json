And fatality rates in intensive-care units can mislead if the demographics of the people admitted change over time. For example, many hospitals reported high numbers of younger patients as the pandemic wore on…As a result, it has taken researchers some time to determine whether the number of deaths per SARS-CoV-2 infection is really falling, particularly for older people, says epidemiologist Ali Mokdad at the University of Washington in Seattle. Mokdad and his colleagues have been monitoring global data, with a focus on the United States and Europe. A provisional analysis, he says, which includes data from the American Hospital Association, now suggests that the number of fatalities per infection might have fallen by 20%.</em></li> <li>Why This Matters: Understanding how deadly COVID-19 really is to different members of a community will not only help treatment but public policy.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s a link to the full article: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03132-4\">NATURE</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
