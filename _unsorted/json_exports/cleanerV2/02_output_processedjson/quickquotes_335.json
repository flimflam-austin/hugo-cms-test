These cultures did not generally need calendars that specify exact dates far in advance.

Also, there are many different Native American names for the full Moons.” Johnston.</em></li> <li>January Full Moon names include: Candles Moon, Snow Moon, Hunger Moon, Center Moon, Cold Moon, <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/1675/the-next-full-moon-is-another-wolf-moon/\">and more.</a> It occurred on Thursday, January 28th.</li> <li>“Full moons happen when the moon is exactly on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun, so the entire Earth-facing side is illuminated.” <a href=\"https://www.space.com/35281-january-full-moon.html\">Space.com</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Typically we will see 12 full moons – one every month. 2021 will contrast with 2020 as 2020 featured 13 full moons, and many unique attributes only seen every few decades (such as a full, blue moon on Halloween).</p> <p>Here’s an excellent review of full moon in January: <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/1675/the-next-full-moon-is-another-wolf-moon/\">CLICK HERE</a></p> <p>Here’s our overview on the *unique* 2020’s full moon cycle: <a href=\"https://smarthernews.com/article/harvestmoon2020/\">READ MORE</a></p> <p>Here’s your list of full moons *just in case* you want to keep track!</p> <p>FULL MOON CALENDAR 2021</p> <p>Feb. 27: Snow moon<br> March 28: Worm moon<br> April 26: Pink moon<br> May 26: Flower moon<br> June 24: Strawberry moon<br> July 23: Buck moon<br> Aug. 22: Sturgeon moon<br> Sept. 20: Harvest moon<br> Oct. 20: Hunter’s moon<br> Nov. 19: Beaver moon<br> Dec. 18: Cold moon</p> ",
