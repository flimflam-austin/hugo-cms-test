  "body": " <ul> <li><strong>What Happened &amp; When:</strong> Early Christmas morning, <a href=\"https://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/10443/MNPD-FBI-and-ATF-Investigating-Todays-Intentional-Explosion-on-2nd-Avenue-North-in-Downtown-Nashville.aspx\">Nashville</a> police responded to reports of shots fired in the city’s downtown neighborhood. When they arrived on the scene, they encountered an RV playing a recorded warning stating that it would detonate within 15 minutes, allowing officers to work quickly to evacuate nearby residents.</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters (Just a handful of the numerous reasons):&nbsp;</strong> <ul> <li>When the RV exploded, three people were injured and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</li> <li>Nearby structures, including residential buildings and businesses were damaged – some significantly. The latest report from local news counts at least 41 businesses impacted. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-mayor-john-cooper-on-face-the-nation-december-27-2020/\">Mayor Cooper</a> said the damage to the nearby area is similar to the type of damage caused by a tornado (Nashville experienced <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/25/us/nashville-2020-tornado-derecho-explosion-trnd/index.html\">several deadly tornados</a> earlier this year).</li> <li>The explosion took place outside an <a href=\"https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html\">AT&amp;T</a> transmission hub, causing internet, phone and 911 service outages in Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Who:</strong>&nbsp;On Sunday, the FBI announced the identity of human remains discovered at the blast site, a 63-year-old man described as “the bomber” by the investigators. Officials were able to identify the man via DNA. The motive is unknown, but investigators from the FBI &amp; ATF are continuing to work&nbsp; to acquire more information.</li> <li><strong>Something To Consider:</strong> Although the <strong>investigation continues</strong>, law enforcement say there is no ongoing threat and that there does not appear to be any additional suspects at this time.</li> <li><strong>The Responding Officers:</strong> Sergeant Timothy Miller,&nbsp; Officer James Wells,&nbsp; Officer Amanda Topping, Officer Michael Sipos, Officer James Luellen and Officer Brenna Hosey: <em>“It was God…That’s what saved my life. That’s what got me to see my wife and kids on Christmas.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.newschannel5.com/news/metro-officers-who-evacuated-homes-on-christmas-before-explosion-to-hold-press-conference\">This is a good link with a video to the stories told by the officers – fast forward to 6 minutes in to hear directly from the officers.</a></li> </ul> ",
