    "cardText": "Important Context:\n------------------\n\n*   U.S. designated Iran a state sponsor of terror since 1984; only 3 other countries (Syria, North Korea & Sudan) share this label.\n*   Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons (which they deny) has worried several U.S. presidents because of Iran’s connection with terror groups & their desire to assert themselves as a superpower."
  },
  "card_3": {
    "cardText": "Why \\*Extra Tense\\* Now?\n------------------------\n\n*   **Saturday:** Attack on Iranian military parade killed at least 25, injured dozens. Iran gov’t blames U.S. and threatens retaliation.\n*   **UN General Assembly:** Iran & U.S. Presidents trade jabs.\n*   **Sanctions:**A America will implement sanctions on Iran’s oil market in approx. 45 days; both Iran & U.S. under pressure economically & diplomatically."

  "card_4": {
    "cardText": "> “As victims of terrorism in the past and today, we have always been and will always remain in the forefront of genuine confrontation with terrorism.”\n> \n> Iranian Pres. Rouhani during UN address. The U.S. State Dep't just issued an annual report underscoring Iran's status as a state sponsor of terror and highlighted Iran's relationship with groups like al Qaeda."

  "card_5": {
    "cardText": "> “We are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially. We cannot allow the worlda\u0019s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planeta\u0019s most dangerous weapons.”\n> \n> Pres. Trump during UN address. America received pushback from China, France, U.K and Russia (the other signatories of the original \"nuclear deal\") about joining in sanctions on Iran's oil exports; they want to stay \"in\" the nuclear deal, for now."

  "card_10": {
    "cardText": "U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Matt responded to Iranian threats: \"We've been clear; they shouldn't take us on like that\". FYI: Iran fired rockets at U.S. embassy in Baghdad & consulate in Basra in early Sept after blaming America for igniting anti-Iran dissent.\n\n[view sources](https://smarthernews.com/18-09-27-iran-u-s/)"
