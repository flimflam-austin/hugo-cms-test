  "body": "<p><strong>Read the Executive Order</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/\">CLICK HERE</a></p> <p>The President met with families of those who had what he described as “deadly interactions with police” and said he made a commitment to create solutions for law enforcement, while at the same time complimenting the “overwhelming number of really good and great police officers.”</p> <p>The executive order, though limited, aims to accomplish these goals:</p> <ul> <li>Create a national registry to track instances of police misconduct resulting&nbsp; in termination,&nbsp; criminal conviction or civil judgments.<br> Grants certain funding to police departments that implement certain use of force and training standards, like banning chokeholds except if an officer’s life is at risk.</li> <li>Grants certain funding to police departments that involve social workers and mental health professionals on calls dealing with homelessness, mental illness and addiction.</li> </ul> <p>Why This Matters: The executive order sets precedent for legislation currently being drafted by Congress, and can potentially compliment future law that may carry more “strength” than a unilateral move by the White House.&nbsp; As lawmakers go through a series of time-consuming negotiations before finalizing legislation, the President moved forward on these priorities.</p>",
