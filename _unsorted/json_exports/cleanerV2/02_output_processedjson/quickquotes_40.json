  "body": "<p>Sometimes, we just need to see things differently.</p> <p>When I launched SmartHER News, I simply wanted to see news differently.</p> <p>I dreamed of my ideal news platform:&nbsp;a&nbsp;quick and easy news source, fiercely nonpartisan, committed to high-quality information in small bites.</p> <p>And for two and a half years, I –&nbsp;along with a handful of dedicated teammates – have worked to make it a reality, and we feel more inspired than ever that SmartHER News is blooming at just the right time.</p> <p>But I didn’t build SmartHER News just to change news delivery – I wanted to enrich your whole experience.</p> <p>So I eliminated all the things I hate! Pop-up ads that suddenly cover the screen. Annoying commercials that&nbsp;start playing on blast (usually when you’re in a quiet coffee shop). And firewalls that force you to subscribe.</p> <p>I don’t want any of that!</p> <p>But we do want to grow our team so we can better serve you.</p> <p>So I thought, “If I could support a company I believed in, how would I want to do it?”</p> <p>I’d want something cool. Something smart. Something that made me feel good and a part of the mission.</p> <p>And here’s what happened:</p> <p>From our headquarters in Texas, we worked with a small business owner in Virginia (Jennifer), and an artist in Arizona (Delfina), to create our <a href=\"http://SmartHERnews.com/shop\">first SmartHER product</a>.</p> <p>These <a href=\"http://smarthernews.com/shop\">engraved mugs</a> have all 50 U.S.&nbsp;states etched in a new image of America – unique, diverse, beautiful and full of grit (it will not damage in the dishwasher).</p> <p>They come in handy (and in a few different sizes), keep your&nbsp;drink&nbsp;hot or cold, and the design serves as a gentle reminder&nbsp;of the&nbsp;United States right before Election Day.</p> <p>By&nbsp;<a href=\"http://Smarthernews.com/shop\">purchasing&nbsp;one of these mugs</a> you can become part of the team – your support goes directly to helping SmartHER News grow.</p> <p>We hope you love them as much as we do.</p> <p>Thank you for helping us turn this dream into a reality.</p> <p>We are deeply grateful…you inspire us each and every day.</p> <p>In gratitude,</p> <p>Jenna</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
