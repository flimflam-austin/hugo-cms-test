They returned to Earth in January.</li> <li>Some of the mice were genetically modified –&nbsp; As the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/12dda166796549a4b64f4e0321d531de\">Associated Press describes</a>: “The treatment involves blocking a pair of proteins that typically limit muscle mass.”</li> <li>The genetically modified mice returned to Earth with bigger muscles than the others.</li> <li>The researchers also administered the treatment to some mice upon landing; those mice also built muscle mass.</li> <li>Why It Matters: A major challenge for humans and space travel is loss of muscle mass. Astronauts exercise up to 2 hours a day to prevent the effects. Muscle loss is also a challenge for anyone suffering from a disease that leaves them bedridden, or someone who is paralyzed. The researchers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/07/world/mighty-mice-space-station-study-scn-wellness-trnd/index.html\">said</a>: <em>“Our hope is that this could be used both for astronauts during extended space travel and for people on Earth suffering from muscle and bone loss. There is still a lot of work that would need to be done in this regard, but we believe that this type of strategy holds promise.”</em><a href=\"https://apnews.com/12dda166796549a4b64f4e0321d531de\">‘Mighty mice’ stay musclebound in space, boon for astronauts</a>Here’s some background on the study and the researchers: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/rodents-and-a-rocket-carried-researchers-dreams-into-space-rodent-research-19\">Rodents and a rocket carried these researchers’ dreams to space</a></li> </ul>",
