  "body": " <p>First Lady Melania Trump wrote about her personal experiences with COVID-19 in a lengthy summary.</p> <p>She announced her 14-year-old son’s positive diagnosis but also described him as having no symptoms.</p> <p>A few of the most noteworthy excerpts:</p> <p><strong>On spending her illness with her husband and son:</strong> <em>“In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together.”</em></p> <p><strong>Description of her illness:</strong> <em>I was very fortunate as my diagnosis came with minimal symptoms, though they hit me all at once and it seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after. I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><strong>Thoughts on wellness:</strong> <em>A balanced diet, fresh air, and vitamins really are vital to keep our bodies healthy. For your complete well-being, compassion and humility are just as important in keeping our minds strong. For me personally, the most impactful part of my recovery was the opportunity to reflect on many things—family, friendships, my work, and staying true to who you are.</em></p> <p><strong>Election mention:</strong> <em>“We are in unprecedented times—and with the election fast approaching, it has been easy to get caught up in so much negative energy.”</em></p> <p>READ HER POST IN FULL <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/first-lady-melania-trump-personal-experience-covid-19/\">HERE</a></p> ",
