  "body": "<ul> <li>Previously, the CDC said the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 depended mainly on larger respiratory droplets, transmitted by an infected person within relatively close proximity to another, when coughing, singing, or even talking. <strong>This is the reason behind guidance for social distancing and mask-wearing.</strong></li> <li>Now the CDC says the guidance should include <strong>airborne transmission</strong> – meaning a tiny particle, released when even breathing, may hang in the air longer than a typical respiratory droplet, opening up the potential scenarios someone *may* get infected.</li> <li>This puts the new coronavirus in a category like <strong>chicken pox and measles</strong> of diseases that may be spread through airborne droplets.</li> <li>The World Health organization says airborne transmission is when a particle <em>“remains infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time</em>.”</li> <li>The CDC offers <strong>this qualifier</strong>: <em>“There is evidence that under <strong>certain conditions</strong>, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away. These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation. Sometimes the infected person was breathing heavily, for example while singing or exercising.”&nbsp;</em></li> <li>A variety of different <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html\">health professionals have asked the CDC for months to include this guidance,</a> thinking it would add a more complete understanding of the threat of infection and mask policies.</li> <li>Several weeks ago the CDC published what it described as a ‘draft’ of this notable change to the main CDC website and then retracted it, saying it was premature.</li> <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> In the immediate, this reflects a broadening of ways COVID-19 can be transmitted.&nbsp; It puts further emphasis on mask-wearing as a potential layer of protection.</li> <li><strong>What to Watch For:</strong> We’ll watch to see if this revelation changes any policies within states for indoor dining, education, recreational activities, and beyond.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s the official page: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html\">CLICK HERE</a></p>",
