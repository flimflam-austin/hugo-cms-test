  "body": "<ul> <li>After weeks of failed COVID-19 relief negotiations in Congress, Pres. Trump tigned four executive orders providing for the following: <ul> <li><strong>$400-per-week in supplemental unemployment&nbsp;</strong><b>benefits</b> to unemployment recipients. Previously, they received an extra $600 under a program that expired in July. Under the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/\">order</a>, $300 will come from the federal government, with the states being asked to cover the remaining $100.</li> <li><strong>Deferral of payroll tax collection for people making less than $100k. </strong>This fourth round of payroll tax deferrals extends the holiday from September 1 to December 31. Pres. Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/\">added</a> “<em>If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. &nbsp;So I’m going to make them all permanent.</em>“</li> <li><strong>Deferral of student loan payments and interest until December 31. </strong>An existing<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/\"> policy</a> set to expire in September suspended student loan payment and cut interest rates to 0%.</li> <li><b>Recommended protections for renters and homeowners.&nbsp; </b>The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/\">order</a> directs the &nbsp;Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to “<em>promote the ability of renters and homeowners to avoid eviction or foreclosure resulting from financial hardships caused by COVID-19</em>.”</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Pres. Trump received criticisms from legislators from both sides of the aisle – but for different reasons. <ul> <li>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi/\">said</a> “<em>President Trump’s meager executive actions <strong>do little for working families.</strong> Republicans must come back to the negotiating table, meet us halfway and work toward a compromise that will truly help American workers and familie</em>s.”</li> <li>Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) <a href=\"https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7E22ECEA-CE33-4E4E-B109-6C0ED418170F\">said</a> “<em>The pen-and-phone theory of executive lawmaking is unconstitutional slop. President Obama did not have the power to unilaterally rewrite immigration law with DACA, and President <strong>Trump does not have the power to unilaterally rewrite the payroll tax law.</strong> Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the American people acting through their members of Congress</em>.”</li> <li>The President meanwhile accused the Democrats of too many “add-ons” to a stimulus bill: &nbsp;<em>“…what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money…They want to bailout states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years — and, in fact, in all cases, many decades. &nbsp;And we’re not willing to do that.”&nbsp; Read the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/\">President’s comments HERE</a></em></li> </ul> </li> </ul>",
