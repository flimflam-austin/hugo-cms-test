    "cardText": "How We Forecast Hurricanes\n--------------------------\n\n*   Satellites, aircraft use radar to constantly scan the oceans for areas of high wind.\n*   Wind causes the sea level to rise, which can lead to a deadly effect of a hurricane: storm surge.\n*   Bottom line: The worlds’ oceans are massive. We don’t have the technology to cover the whole surface constantly."

Models and observations are the base infrastructure that allows human forecasters to do better forecasts.”\n> \n> David Novak, Director of the National Weather Service's Prediction Center, speaking in 2017 to CNBC. Technology helps forecasts, he says, but the human analysis remains important."
