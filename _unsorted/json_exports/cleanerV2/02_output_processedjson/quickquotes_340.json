  "body": " <ul> <li>The CDC conducted phone interviews with a random selection of 350 people with COVID-19 (both inpatient and outpatient) from nine states.</li> <li>Participants were asked about their interactions with others, specifically if they came within 6 feet of a person diagnosed with COVID-19 during the two weeks leading up to their disease onset or test date (for asymptomatic patients).</li> <li>WHY IT MATTERS: The study illustrates the extent of asymptomatic spread and, according to the study’s researchers, the “<em>need for increased<strong> screening, case investigation, contact tracing, and isolation</strong> of infected persons during periods of community transmission</em>” and “<em>suggests that ensuring <strong>social distancing</strong> and more widespread use of cloth <strong>face coverings</strong> are warranted.”</em></li> <li>Researchers also noted that the study has limits – namely that participants were not representative of cases nationwide because they were all affiliated with academic medical centers and their self-reported results were telephone-based.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",
