    "cardText": "Why It Matters\n--------------\n\n*   More production at home makes the U.S. less reliant on volatile Middle East, creating more jobs for production & distribution.\n*   Also important to remember: **Oil is a global market.** If Saudi Arabia or Russia ramped up production dramatically, it could drive prices lower – potentially to a point that would make extracting oil from shale not worth it financially."
