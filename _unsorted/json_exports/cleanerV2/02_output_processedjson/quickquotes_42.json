We will get 13 full moons; the second full moon in one month time period is called a “blue moon” – hence the expression, “once in a blue moon.”</li> <li>P.S. October will have two full moons, including one on Halloween night! <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/03/full-moon-2020-calendar-supermoons-lunar-eclipses-blue-moons-more/4489314002/\">READ MORE</a></li> </ul> <p>MORE ON 2020 FULL MOONS: <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/03/full-moon-2020-calendar-supermoons-lunar-eclipses-blue-moons-more/4489314002/\">READ MORE</a></p> <p>More from Jamie Carter:<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2020/08/02/full-red-moon-sparkles-then-creeps-up-on-the-red-planet-what-to-watch-for-in-the-night-sky-this-week/#5cbd12867b06\"> CLICK LINK</a></p> ",
