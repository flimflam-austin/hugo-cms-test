  "body": " <p>In the aftermath of last week’s riot at the U.S. Capitol several lawmakers have called for the President to resign, be impeached, or be removed under the 25th Amendment — most are Democrats, but some are Republicans.</p> <ul> <li>Ahead of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-10-2021-n1253663\">Sen. Toomey</a>‘s remarks on Sunday, <a href=\"ttps://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/\">Sen. Lisa Murkowski</a> (R-AK) became the first sitting senator to call for the President’s resignation, stating he’s “<em>caused enough damage,</em>” on Friday. <ul> <li>*IF* Pres. Trump were to resign, he’d be only the second president to do so. In 1976, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/richard-m-nixon/\">Pres. Nixon</a> resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Draft <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/490165056/Articles-of-Impeachment-Incitement-of-Insurrection-pdf-4#from_embed\">articles of impeachment</a> have been drawn up by the House of Representatives against Pres. Trump for&nbsp; “incitement of insurrection” and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/house-vote-on-trump-impeachment-will-happen-this-week-rep-clyburn\">House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn</a> (D-SC) said the House will vote on them this week. <ul> <li>*IF* the House votes in favor of the articles of impeachment, it’s unclear how quickly the impeachment process would play out. <ul> <li>Remember: Impeachment is complicated process. <a href=\"https://smarthernews.com/impeachment-history/\">CLICK HERE</a> for an impeachment refresher.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>A day after the riot at the U.S. Capitol, U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) announced he’s calling for 25th Amendment be invoked “<em>for the sake of our democracy</em>.” <ul> <li>*IF* you hear people talking about the 25th Amendment, they’re probably referencing Section 4, which allows the Vice President and a majority of the President’s Cabinet declare the president unfit, allowing the Vice President to becomes acting president. <ul> <li>On Monday, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1348415150018195457/photo/1\">House</a> will vote on a bill calling on Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> ",
