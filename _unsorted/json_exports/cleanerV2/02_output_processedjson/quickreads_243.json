It was featured in the WannaCry attacks in May and the NotPetya attacks in June, both of which swept through hospitals, banks and governments in several countries. But after July, the rates of ransomware infections dropped sharply, according to a report from Malwarebytes in January. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/petya-goldeneye-wannacry-ransomware-global-epidemic-just-started/\">https://www.cnet.com/news/petya-goldeneye-wannacry-ransomware-global-epidemic-just-started/</a></li> <li>Boeing Possibly Hit by a\u0018WannaCrya\u0019 Malware Attack<br> <em>WannaCry was first developed at the National Security Agency and later dumped online in 2016 by mysterious hackers called the a\u001cShadow Brokers.a\u001d</em><br> <em> That tool, which the N.S.A. code-named Eternal Blue, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software that allowed attackers to spread their malware automatically through vulnerable machines. In other cases, ransomware attackers had to manually encrypt victima\u0019s systems.</em><em>By incorporating the N.S.A.a\u0019s tool into their ransomware last May, hackers ensured their attack would encrypt as many vulnerable machines as possible, causing maximum disruption. White House officials said North Korea was a\u001cdirectly responsiblea\u001d for the attack.<br> </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/boeing-wannacry-malware.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/boeing-wannacry-malware.html</a></li> <li>A Cyberattack Hobbles Atlanta, and Security Experts Shudder:<br> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/cyberattack-atlanta-ransomware.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;mod=djemceocouncil\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/cyberattack-atlanta-ransomware.html</a></li> </ul> "
