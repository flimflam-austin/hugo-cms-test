His primary opponent,&nbsp; Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party, said he would offer voters a renegotiated Brexit deal and the option to remain in the EU.</li> <li>On Twitter, Pres. Trump congratulated Johnson on his win, and wrote “<em>Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U.
