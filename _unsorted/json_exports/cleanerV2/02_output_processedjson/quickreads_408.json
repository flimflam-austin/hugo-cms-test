  "body": " <ul> <li>SmartHER News has readers all over the world and we were lucky enough to get a perspective from a Hawaii resident – Here’s Laly’s take: <p><em>“…I moved to Hawaii , Oahu, in 1991, my first trip to another island was to the Big Island a week after an eruption; when I visited the Volcanoa\u0019s Park I saw smoke from trees still burning and roads a\u001ceatena\u001d by the lava. I was fortunate to get to see two of the black sand beaches before one of them was covered by the lava of another eruption.</em><em>I worked as a tour guide, for Spanish speaking tourist for a while, so I read as much as I could to learn about Hawaii. One the the things I learned about Kilauea is that they seem to have a record on an eruption back in 1820, the next record of eruptions started again in 1983. When I moved to Honolulu in 1991, there were eruptions but not as often as probably the past 5 years and especially the past two years when we saw a lot of activity. There are several craters at the Kilauea, the biggest is where the lava is always oozing. Most of the lava flows from past eruptions has been flowing to the ocean.</em><em>So far the latest eruption that started last week, ita\u0019s been the worst Ia\u0019ve seen, because of the cracks happening everywhere, lava burning everything in its path, adding the many little earthquakes, and now dangerous toxic gas in the air. They are talking about air do toxic that if it rains it will be like a\u001cacid raina\u001d.</em></p> <p><em>Like everything else in Hawaii, hurricanes, very warm weather, tsunamis, gigantic waves; we are used to them and also a\u001cprepareda\u001d for all of that; what still amazes me is how normal it is for those people, most of them local people, who live around the Kilauea in the Big Island, knowing that an eruption can happen anywhere at any time; to them is part of their everyday life.”</em></p></li> <li><strong>Experience the Heartbeat of a Volcanic Landscape:</strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/havo/index.htm\"> https://www.nps.gov/havo/index.htm</a></li> <li><strong>USGS Volcanoes:</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/994282094904856576\"> https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/994282094904856576</a></li> <li><strong>Kilauea Volcano Erupts:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/kilauea-volcano-erupts\">https://www.usgs.gov/news/kilauea-volcano-erupts</a></li> <li><strong>Count of Hawai’i Civil Defense Messages &amp; Alerts</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.hawaiicounty.gov/active-alerts\">www.hawaiicounty.gov/active-alerts</a></li> </ul>"
