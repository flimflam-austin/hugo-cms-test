This number is a five week high. <ul> <li>The increase is notable because this weekly data point had shown some improvement (lower number of Americans filing for unemployment).</li> <li>Some analysis: “Weekly unemployment insurance claims are moving in the wrong direction with the first back-to-back increases since July. Together with a slower-than-expected drop in continuing claims, we’re seeing the effects of rapidly-rising Covid-19 cases across the country. ” <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-hit-5-week-high-as-record-coronavirus-wave-triggers-more-layoffs-11606312161?mod=home-page\">Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> American spending power fuels the U.S. economy and by proxy – adds momentum to the world economy as well. With COVID cases on the rise, and restrictions once again impacting not only business owners but would-be consumers, the focus turns again to Congress and whether or not another stimulus plan with support (added unemployment benefits, loans) will pass before the Christmas holiday.</li> </ul>",
