  "body": " <ul> <li><strong>THE LATEST:</strong>&nbsp; On Monday afternoon, the President’s doctor announced that the President would return to the White House. Dr. Sean Conley <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?476637-1/dr-sean-conley-confirms-president-trump-return-white-house\">explained</a> that although Pres. Trump met the standards for discharge criteria, he “<em><strong>may not entirely be out of the woods yet</strong></em>.” <ul> <li>Dr. Coney said it’s been more than 72 hours since the President’s last fever and that his oxygen levels are normal.</li> <li>The President has received one dose of antiviral Remdesivir during each day since his Friday arrival at Walter Reed – the same he announced his diagnosis.&nbsp; He had his fourth dose before leaving the hospital and will receive his fifth and final dose at the White House on Tuesday.</li> <li>While at the White House, the President will continue to be treated with a steroid (dexamethasone) and have access to 24/7 medical care.</li> <li>Dr. Conley <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?476637-1/dr-sean-conley-confirms-president-trump-return-white-house\">said</a> the President cannot resume his regular schedule until “<strong><em>there is no evidence of live virus still present.</em></strong>”</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>BIG PICTURE:</strong> To date, the following people in the President’s <strong>inner circle</strong> (many of who were present at the September 26th Rose Garden ceremony where Pres. Trump formally announced the nomination of Judge Amy Barrett to the Supreme Court) have tested positive for COVID-19 : <ul> <li>White House Press Sec. Kayleigh McEnany &amp; Assistant Press Secretaries Chad Gilmartin, Karoline Leavitt, Harrison W. Fields and Jalen Drummond</li> <li>White House aide&nbsp;Nick Luna</li> <li>White House adviser Stephen Miller</li> <li>Longtime aide Hope Hicks</li> <li>RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel</li> <li>Campaign Manager Bill Stepien</li> <li>Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis</li> <li>Former&nbsp; White House advisor Kellyanne Conway</li> <li>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT:</strong> We’ll continue to&nbsp; get regular updates concerning the President’s progress . In the meantime, expect to hear about additional cases of COVID-19 connected to the White House.&nbsp; It’s possible that others will test positive in the coming days following a series of recent negative test results – that’s what happened to White House Press Sec. Kayleigh McEnany.</li> </ul> ",
