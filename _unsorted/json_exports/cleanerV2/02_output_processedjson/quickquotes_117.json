And therefore it represents a big threat to us because, having strains that are more transmissible will prolong the pandemic and also increases the risk of more and more cases. We are doing sequencing because we really want to track these variants so we can halt them or curtail their spread very rapidly, if we are able to identify them,”&nbsp; </em>Dr. Chiu <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/why-covid-mutations-matter-in-containing-the-virus/\">said</a> this week.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
