(from a government footnote form the Government Accountability Office recent testimony)A <em>In this statement, we refer to unaccompanied alien children as unaccompanied children because this is the term used by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The term a\u001cunaccompanied alien childa\u001d refers to a child who (1) has no lawful immigration status in the United States, (2) has not attained 18 years of age, and (3) has no parent or legal guardian in the United States or no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody. 6 U.S.C. A 279(g)(2). Children traveling with related adults other than a parent or legal guardiana\u0014such as a grandparent or siblinga\u0014are still deemed unaccompanied. While these children may have parents or guardians already in the United States, if the parent or guardian is unable to provide immediate care, the child is considered unaccompanied.A <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/691526.pdf\">https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/691526.pdf</a>A </em></li> </ul> "
