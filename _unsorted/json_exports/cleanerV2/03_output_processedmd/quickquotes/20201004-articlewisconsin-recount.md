*   Recount laws vary by state. In Wisconsin, there are no automatic recounts, but a candidate may request a recount if they are within 1% of their opponent.
*   According to the latest results, Joe Biden leads the Pres. Trump by approximately 20,500 votes with 99% of districts reports. As a result, many news outlets have declared Joe Biden the winner of Wisconsin.
*   In [2016](\"https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/completed-wisconsin-recount-widens-donald-trumps-lead-by-131-votes/article_3f61c6ac-5b18-5c27-bf38-e537146bbcdd.html\"), Pres Trump won Wisconsin by less than 23,000 votes. A Wisconsin recount helped him increase his lead over Hillary Clinton by more than 100 votes.
*   The Trump 2020 campaign also announced it is filing a lawsuit in [Michigan](\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-campaign-statement-on-michigan-lawsuit/\") to stop ballot counting until the campaign has _“meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process_.”
