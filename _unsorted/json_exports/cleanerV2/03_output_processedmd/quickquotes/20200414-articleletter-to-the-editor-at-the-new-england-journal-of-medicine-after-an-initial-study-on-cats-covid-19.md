*   Researchers inoculated cats with SARS-CoV-2 and then housed the cats with 3 others without exposure.
*   Eventually all 6 cats showed presence of the virus but no symptoms.
*   Researchers found evidence of the virus in nose swabs on the cats for several days.
*   They say more research is needed.
*   **Why It Matters:** Researchers say families need to know about the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pet cats. This is especially important if family members are self-isolating within a home to prevent other family members from becoming ill. _“With reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to domestic cats1 and to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo,4 coupled with our data showing the ease of transmission between domestic cats, there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human–cat–human transmission.”_
