He also rescued dachshunds, and had two of his own, Sparky and Pebbles.
*   Sicknick will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, among other military service members, and some of the most famous names in American history including former president John F. Kennedy and the first African American Justice of the Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall.
