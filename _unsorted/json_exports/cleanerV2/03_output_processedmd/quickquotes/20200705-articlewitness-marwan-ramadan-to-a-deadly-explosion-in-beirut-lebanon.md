*   Early reports suggest an explosion caused by fire, fireworks, and an explosive ingredient (often found in fertilizer) stored near the port after being confiscated by a ship caused the explosion. For context on how powerful this ingredient, ammonium nitrate, is – it was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
*   Some raise questions about other sources – Pres. Trump said military leaders thought it was a “bomb of some kind.”
*   Background: Hezbollah, a designated foreign terror organization by the U.S. state department with ties to Iran, is based in Lebanon. One analyst assessed before this explosion, in an unrelated report:  “The group maintains a missile arsenal larger than any European country in NATO.”
*   Why It Matters: The massive explosion injured thousands and the number of dead continues to grow to now reportedly more than 100. This explosion also both raises questions about the current state of the Middle East, also under pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, and serves as a reminder that events unrelated to the pandemic crisis can quickly change the news cycle.
