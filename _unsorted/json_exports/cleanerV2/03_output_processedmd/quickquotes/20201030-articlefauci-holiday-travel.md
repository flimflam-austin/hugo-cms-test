*   [Dr. Fauci](\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-11-29-20-dr-anthony-fauci/story?id=74446435\") added there will “almost certainly” be an uptick in the weeks ahead due to Thanksgiving holiday travel.
    *   On Sunday, the [TSA](\"https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput\") screened the most passengers (1.1 million) in a single day since mid-March, topping off a week that reported more than 6.4 million  air travelers – that’s a massive increase compared to recent months, but still 10 million less compared to the Thanksgiving holiday week in 2019.
*   Dr. Fauci advised that those who recently traveled (and are able to do so) should get tested and quarantine.
*   In terms of what state and local governments can do to help slow the spread, he said “close the bars and keep the schools open” – though he also noted there is no one size fits all policy that works for every community.
*   **HELP IS ON THE WAY:** In recent weeks three pharmaceutical companies announced promising clinical trial results for COVID-19 vaccines. On Monday, Moderna joined Pfizer, becoming the second company to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA for its COVID-19 vaccine.
    *   Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said  he expects the U.S. will have 40 million doses of vaccines available for high-risk and vulnerable populations, such as frontline workers, by the end of the year. However, vaccines are not expected to be widely available until next year.
