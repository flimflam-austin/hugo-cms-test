*   Martinez talked the health of his team scheduled to play the Florida Marlins this weekend; more than a dozen Marlin players/staff have tested positive for COVID-19.
*   \*\*UPDATE\*\* [MARLINS SEASON PUT ON HOLD](\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/marlins/2020/07/29/miami-marlins-covid-19-outbreak-latest-updates/5528087002/\").
