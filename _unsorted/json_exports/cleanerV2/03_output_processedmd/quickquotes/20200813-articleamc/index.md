*   To celebrate its anniversary and as part of its phased reopening, AMC will open about 100 theaters on August 20 offering 15-cent flicks.
*   Even after “Movies in 2020 at 1920 Prices” ends on August 21, [AMC](http://investor.amctheatres.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404963658) will bring back classics like “Back To The Future” and  “Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back” for only $5 in the coming weeks as another 300 theaters are expected to open.
*   **BIG PICTURE:** COVID-19 forced AMC and other movie theater chains to shut their doors in March. So far this year, the U.S. box office has only earned about **[$1.8B](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/?ref_=bo_nb_rl_secondarytab)** – that’s more than $9B less than 2019.
