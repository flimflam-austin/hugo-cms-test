*   Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, was swimming with her daughter an estimated 20 yards off-shore when she was attacked Monday; her daughter swam back to shore unharmed.
*   According to reports, Holowach summered in Maine, known in the local community and was swimming in a wet suit – kayakers helped her back to shore where she was declared dead.
*   A tooth fragment determined a great white shark attack.
*   NYT reports: Seal populations have grown in the area with federal protections, and the sharks follow the seals to feed.
*   According to one database, this is only the second unprovoked shark attack sine 1837.
*   **Why It Matters**: This is an extraordinarily rare event, especially in Maine, a state that normally doesn’t break into the top 3 of shark attacks in the United States (Florida, Hawaii and California).
