*   Media-telebriefing held by CDC Dir Robert Redfield and CDC’s Deputy Director of Infectious Diseases and COVID-19 Response Incident Jay Butler.
*   CDC says as far as **navigating increased socializing, Dr. Butler says here’s a general rule of thumb**: the closer you are to other people, the longer interaction lasts, and the greater number of people you may interact with = higher risk of infection/spread.
*   **On whether cases are rising in states because of relaxing social distancing guidelines**, CDC says there are several factors that may include more testing availability, and/or higher transmission, but there’s no one answer (yet). They are watching hospitalization rates, and hospitalization rates overall appear steady. \*\*In addition, Dr. Redfield mentioned some states have started to test their nursing home and prison populations proactively – this could lead to more positive test results of those asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.\*\*
*   **On whether a stay-at-home orders maybe needed or authorized again**: Maybe needed again but CDC looks for those decisions to be made locally.
