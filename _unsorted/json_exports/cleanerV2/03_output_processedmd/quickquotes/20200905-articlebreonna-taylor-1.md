*   In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was killed after she was shot multiple times by police inside her Louisville, KY home after police conducting a drug investigation entered using a ‘no-knock’ warrant, meaning they were not required to identify themselves before entering her home.
    *   The three plain-clothed police officers said they did in fact identify themselves, but witnesses say otherwise.
    *   Breonna’s live-in boyfriend said they were scared and thought they were being robbed so he grabbed his legally registered gun and fired a shot that struck an officer in the leg.
    *   No drugs were found and none of the officers were wearing body cameras.
    *   The officers have been placed on administrative reassignment.
*   The Louisville law will also require officers use and turn on body cameras five minutes before and after searches.
*   **BIGGER PICTURE:** On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced a federal bill that would ban no-knock warrants by federal law enforcement, prohibit federal law enforcement officers from carrying out a warrant until after the officer provides notice of his or her authority and purpose. The bill would also ban no-knock warrants in any state or local police department that receives federal funding. No-knock warrants are currently permitted in every state except Florida and Oregon.
