*   The Department of Justice Inspector General concluded the FBI’s decisions to open the investigation (and related investigations into four current and former members of the Trump campaign) were free from “political bias” and initiated in compliance with FBI policies.
*   For years, Pres. Trump has described the investigation as a “witch hunt” motivated by politics.
*   While the IG did not find political bias, it did find fault with some of the procedures/processes of the investigation itself.
*   FBI Director Christopher Wray recommended 40 corrective measures to address what the IG called “basic and fundamental errors” and “inaccuracies” with regard to the warrants at the heart of the investigation.
*   In response to the report, U.S. Attorney General William Barr issued the following statement:  
    
    > _“The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken.”_
