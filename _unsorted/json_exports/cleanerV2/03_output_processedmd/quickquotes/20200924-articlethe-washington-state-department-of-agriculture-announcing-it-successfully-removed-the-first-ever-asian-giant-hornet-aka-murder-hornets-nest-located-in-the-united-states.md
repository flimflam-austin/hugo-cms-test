*   Asian giant hornets are about two inches long, and as their name suggests, they are not native to the U.S.
*   According to the [Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA),](\"https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31875\") they are “**the world’s largest hornet and a predator of honey bees and other insects.”** Despite their name, they actually kill only a few humans each year, but a small group of Asian giant hornets is capable of killing a whole honey bee hive in just hours.
*   After five confirmed sightings of Asian giant hornets in Whatcom County dating back to December 2019, WSDA [announced](\"https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31545\") in July that it successfully trapped two – the [first](\"https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31413\") Asian giant hornets ever detected via a trap in America. Their next goal was to trap more and locate the nest.
*   Earlier this week, WSDA announced it found the nest in a tree near Blaine. WSDA located the nest after attaching tracking devices ([via dental floss!](\"https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2020/10/7-photos-show-how-researchers-vacuumed-out-murder-hornet-nest-in-washington-state-what-they-found.html\")) to three hornets.  On Saturday, the WSDA posted a [video](\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3411169195635580\") to Facebook showing workers vacuuming the Asian giant hornets from the nest.
*   On Monday, WSDA will hold a press conference to announce what happens next.
