*   The GDP reading, which measures economic growth, showed an annual growth rate of 33%+ and month-over-month growth of more than 7%. This was better than what Wall Street analysts expected.
*   This record gain over the last three months comes off a huge loss over the previous three months – a reading reflecting the halting of economic activity during COVID.
