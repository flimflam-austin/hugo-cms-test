Cassie King, an organizer with the Berkeley-based group, to the associated press.

*   Saturday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two new bills into law. California became the first state in the nation to ban the sale and production of fur products (fur coats, etc).
*   California also became one of the only states to not allow animals to perform in the circus.

**California becomes first state to ban fur production and sales; animals also barred from circuses**
