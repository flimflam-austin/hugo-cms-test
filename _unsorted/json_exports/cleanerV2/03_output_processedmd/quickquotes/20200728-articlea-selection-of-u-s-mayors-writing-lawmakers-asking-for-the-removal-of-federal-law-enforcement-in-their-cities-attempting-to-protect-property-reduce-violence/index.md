*   Letter drafted by “Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Washington” – [according to Associated Press.](https://apnews.com/ebe8e681d99c3c790ee66e8089e67fdf)
*   Federal forces have deployed to, or have activated in the past, in these cities because of civil unrest.
*   The **federal governments says** forces are needed to protect federal property, and help the city. Reports [indicate the federal government is deploying more forces in places like Portland.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/more-federal-agents-dispatched-to-portland-as-protests-rise-in-other-cities/2020/07/27/20a717be-d03c-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_protests-835pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans) 
*   **City officials say** they do not want federal forces, adds to local tension that leads to more violence. Mayors are asking Congress to make unwanted deployment of federal officials illegal.
*   Many protests remain peaceful, but certain groups have resorted to violence against officers, shootings, lighting fires, destroying city property, so much so that local [police have declared protests “riots](https://t.co/WWtx4SCOjv?amp=1).”
*   Backstory – in places like Portland, Seattle, protests ignited after the death of George Floyd in policy custody over Memorial Day weekend.
*   **Why It Matters**: Civil unrest continues, showing no signs of abatement, some major cities struggle with protecting property and citizens, tension remains between the federal government and local authorities.  **It is not unprecedented for the federal government to send forces into locales without consent** **– but it is more often done with support of local governments.**
