*   The June jobs report: 11.1% unemployment – 4.8M jobs added.
*   This is better than forecasts from economists who expected a slower return of jobs.
*   This week two large states, CA and Texas, returned to shuttering parts of their economies as COVID-19 cases increased.  Conversely, states like NY have just started to return to work. These states have huge economies that impact the nation’s job market overall; California is the 5th largest economy in the world.
*   Why It Matters: The “recovery” from the first wave of job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic has been faster than many economist predicted, but with rising COVID cases, economists are voicing both optimism and concern about the future.
