*   AG Barr delivered his [resignation letter](\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1338614514493878273/photo/1\") to Pres. Trump on Monday.
*   “_Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job_!,” Pres. Trump said of AG Barr – despite some recent criticisms.
*   Deputy AG Jeff Rosen will become the acting Attorney General until Pres-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20th.
*   **WHY IT MATTERS:** Barr is Pres. Trump’s second Attorney General,  nominated in late 2018 to replace Jeff Sessions. His late-term resignation comes as President-elect Joe Biden begins to name new heads of federal agencies ahead of his January 20th inauguration.
