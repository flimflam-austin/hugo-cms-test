    _Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth. A raging virus.  Growing inequity. The sting of systemic racism. A climate in crisis. America’s role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways, but the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we’ve had. Now we’re going to be tested. Are we going to step up, all of us?  It’s time for boldness, for there’s so much to do._
