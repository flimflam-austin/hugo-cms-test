*   During an [interview](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2f36_VhtU\") with MSNBC, Dr Fauci said the U.S. is currently seeing roughly [40,000](\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?utm_source=morning_brew#trends\") new cases a day, but that he wants to see that number decline to 10,000 or less.
*   Dr. Fauci noted that after the COVID-19 case surges we saw following Memorial Day and July 4th, we know that people tend to be careless over holiday weekends, and [said](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2f36_VhtU\") there are specific steps this weekend in order to avoid those surges, including spending more time outdoors than indoors, wearing masks, and hand washing.
*   **BIG PICTURE:** Health officials are particularly concerned about current case levels as we enter the fall and get ready to combat both the flu & COVID-19 simultaneously.
