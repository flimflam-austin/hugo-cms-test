*   NASA announced the name change to honor not only Jackson’s talent as a mathematician and aeronautical engineer, but also her influence promoting the hiring of other women during America’s “space race” and beyond.
*   This follows legislation passed last year to rename a portion of the Washington D.C. street in front of the headquarters to “Hidden Figures Way” to honor a historically significant group of African-American female NASA mathematicians who worked at NASA’s Langley Research Center in the late 1950s and helped start America’s exploration into space.
*   Jackson was part of the group that inspired the book and Hollywood movie. Singer/Actress Janelle Monae played Jackson in the film.
*   Jackson: a former math teacher, became NASA’s first black female engineer in 1958. She started working in a research branch prior to her role as engineer in a segregated section of NASA responsible for “human computing.”
*   Her area of expertise: _“the behavior of the boundary layer of air around airplanes.”_ (NASA)
*   Jackson also worked with children in her hometown of  Hampton, Virginia: _“We have to do something like this to get them interested in science. Sometimes they are not aware of the number of black scientists, and don’t even know of the career opportunities until it is too late.”_
*   In 2019, fourteen years after her death, she was awarded the a congressional gold medal, the highest civilian award
*   In 2016, NASA named a new research facility after Katherine Johnson, another leading NASA black female engineer, who made America’s first flight into space possible. A SmartHER backgrounder on Johnson: [CLICK HERE](https://smarthernews.com/katherine-johnson/)
