*   The charges against Maxwell come almost a year to the day after billionaire hedge fund manager **Jeffrey Epstein** was indicted on charges of abusing underage girls as young as 14 from 2002 to 2005. Allegations against Epstein, a friend of the rich, famous and powerful of all political stripes, had swirled for decades. He pleaded not guilty and committed suicide in his jail cell two months later.
*   Maxwell, whose whereabouts had long remained a mystery, was charged in connection with the ongoing sex abuse investigation into Epstein’s associates, and is accused of helping Epstein sexually assault and abuse multiple minors from the 1994 to 1997.  She previously denied any wrongdoing.
*   In a press conference, the acting U.S. Attorney said

> _“Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself_.”
