*   Beginning on [August 15](\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/\"), lightning ignited hundreds of wildfires across Northern California. To date, there have been over [615](\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/\") new fires, burning more than [1.1](\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/\") million acres across the state, resulting in the loss of [seven](\"https://apnews.com/c9df1469c474c684b7481f4ae873d384\") lives and over [1,200](\"https://apnews.com/c9df1469c474c684b7481f4ae873d384\") buildings and structures.
*   Swain [says](\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/california-fires-why-this-year-is-different.html\") that unlike prior years, this year’s wildfires have reached vegetation areas. like redwoods, that typically are not susceptible to wildfires.
*   **Big Picture:**  The total number of fires this year increased over 60% compared to 2019, and the number of acres burned grew by nearly 260%, as of [August 16](\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/stats-events/\"). Two of this month’s fires have already ranked as #2 and #3 on the list of [California’s top 20 largest wildfires](\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11390/top20_acres.pdf\") dating back to 1932.
