*   The nasal swab test by Australian manufacturer Ellume delivers results **via an app on your phone** and is expected to cost [$30](https://apnews.com/article/over-the-counter-home-coronavirus-test-ac070f4d42d9d7eacc486c9bed4ccaa0).
*   Unlike the other [225+](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-antigen-test-first-over-counter-fully-home-diagnostic) COVID-19 diagnostic tests approved this year by the FDA, Ellume’s is available **over-the-counter**.
*   Last week, [Ellume](https://www.ellumehealth.com/2020/12/10/ellumes-covid-19-home-test-shows-96-accuracy-in-multi-site-us-clinical-study/) requested emergency use authorization from the FDA and submitted the results of a study conducted in five states involving nearly 200 participants ages 2 to 82.
*   According to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-antigen-test-first-over-counter-fully-home-diagnostic), the Ellume test “correctly identified 96% of positive samples and 100% of negative samples in individuals with symptoms. In people without symptoms, the test correctly identified 91% of positive samples and 96% of negative samples. Ellume, the test correctly.”
*   Ellume [says](https://www.ellumehealth.com/2020/12/10/ellumes-covid-19-home-test-shows-96-accuracy-in-multi-site-us-clinical-study/) it plans to ship more than 100,000 tests per day over the next month, and deliver 20 million within the U.S. during the first half of 2021.
