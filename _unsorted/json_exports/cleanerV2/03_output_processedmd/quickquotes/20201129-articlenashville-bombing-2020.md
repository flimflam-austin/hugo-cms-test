*   **What Happened & When:** Early Christmas morning, [Nashville](\"https://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/10443/MNPD-FBI-and-ATF-Investigating-Todays-Intentional-Explosion-on-2nd-Avenue-North-in-Downtown-Nashville.aspx\") police responded to reports of shots fired in the city’s downtown neighborhood. When they arrived on the scene, they encountered an RV playing a recorded warning stating that it would detonate within 15 minutes, allowing officers to work quickly to evacuate nearby residents.
*   **Why It Matters (Just a handful of the numerous reasons):** 
    *   When the RV exploded, three people were injured and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
    *   Nearby structures, including residential buildings and businesses were damaged – some significantly. The latest report from local news counts at least 41 businesses impacted. [Mayor Cooper](\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-mayor-john-cooper-on-face-the-nation-december-27-2020/\") said the damage to the nearby area is similar to the type of damage caused by a tornado (Nashville experienced [several deadly tornados](\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/25/us/nashville-2020-tornado-derecho-explosion-trnd/index.html\") earlier this year).
    *   The explosion took place outside an [AT&T](\"https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html\") transmission hub, causing internet, phone and 911 service outages in Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky.
*   **Who:** On Sunday, the FBI announced the identity of human remains discovered at the blast site, a 63-year-old man described as “the bomber” by the investigators. Officials were able to identify the man via DNA. The motive is unknown, but investigators from the FBI & ATF are continuing to work  to acquire more information.
*   **Something To Consider:** Although the **investigation continues**, law enforcement say there is no ongoing threat and that there does not appear to be any additional suspects at this time.
*   **The Responding Officers:** Sergeant Timothy Miller,  Officer James Wells,  Officer Amanda Topping, Officer Michael Sipos, Officer James Luellen and Officer Brenna Hosey: _“It was God…That’s what saved my life. That’s what got me to see my wife and kids on Christmas.”_ [This is a good link with a video to the stories told by the officers – fast forward to 6 minutes in to hear directly from the officers.](\"https://www.newschannel5.com/news/metro-officers-who-evacuated-homes-on-christmas-before-explosion-to-hold-press-conference\")
