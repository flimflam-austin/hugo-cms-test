*   In addition to those confirmed dead, at least [30 people were injured by gunfire over the weekend](\"https://madmimi.com/s/328cf01\").
*   The city has reeled from protests after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minnesota, and the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta.
*   Protests have evolved to include makeshift illegal barricades, violent shootings. Gov. Kemp: “_Peaceful protests were hijacked by criminals with a dangerous, destructive agenda. Now, innocent Georgians are being targeted, shot, and left for dead.”_
*   From [local news repor](\"https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/kemp-declares-state-of-emergency-after-violent-fourth-of-july-weekend-in-atlanta\")t: “_The mayor and police have allowed protesters to occupy the Wendy’s in recent weeks, allowing for open discussion. But since Turner’s death, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that opportunity no longer stands, and the area will be cleared.”_
*   “_[You can’t blame this on a police officer](\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/06/887602301/enough-is-enough-atlanta-mayor-calls-for-violence-to-end-after-child-killed\"); you can’t say this is about criminal justice reform. This is about some people carrying some weapons who shot up a car with an 8-year-old baby. We are doing each other more harm than any police officer on this force_.” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
*   **Why It Matters:**  In the aftermath of protests focused on criminal justice reform, violence continues to rise in major cities like Atlanta, [Chicago](\"https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/07/06/at-least-73-people-shot-13-of-them-killed-in-4th-of-july-weekend-violence-since-late-friday/\") and [New York](\"https://abc7ny.com/nyc-shootings-2020-last-night-this-week-in/6301407/\").
