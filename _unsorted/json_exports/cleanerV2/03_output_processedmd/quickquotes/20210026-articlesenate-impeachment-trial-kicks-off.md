*   The impeachment trial will look different than President Trump’s first trial (and others).
*   President Trump is the first president impeached twice – his second trial will occur weeks after he left office.
*   President Trump was impeached on one article of impeachment on [“incitement of insurrection.”](\"https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-effort-live-updates/2021/01/11/955631105/impeachment-resolution-cites-trumps-incitement-of-capitol-insurrection\")

*   After Senators were sworn in for the impeachment trial, Republicans attempted to pass a motion to declare the impeachment trial unconstitutional. It failed.
*   **Why It Matters:** In order to convict an official in an impeachment trial, the Senate would need 67 votes or two-thirds majority. The Senate is currently 50 lawmakers voting Democrat, and 50 voting Republican. The early forecasting favors Pres. Trump NOT being convicted – HOWEVER, the Senate trial will include evidence and arguments from both sides.  The proper part of the trial will begin Feb. 9.
