*   **Background:** In 2015, then 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 counts by a federal jury for his involvement in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which left three dead and more than 260 others wounded – many with permanent injures.
    *   During the trial, Tsarnaev’s legal team argued he was not fully responsible because the plot was masterminded by his older brother, who died during a shootout with police in the aftermath of the bombing.
    *   Although 17 of the 30 counts were punishable by death, the jury sentenced him to 6 death sentences and 11 life sentences.
    *   During the appeal, Tsarnaev’s legal team argued he did not receive a fair trial because of juror bias and therefore, some of his convictions should be reversed and his death sentences vacated.
*   **Why:** The appeal was heard by a three-judge panel that [ruled](http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/16-6001P-01A.pdf) in Tsarnaev’s favor, reversing 3 convictions (one of which included a death sentence) and vacating 5 death sentences. They found the trial judge failed to impanel an impartial jury in the highly publicized trial, which was held in the city where the bombing took place.
    *   The judges sent the case back to the lower court for a new penalty-phase trial. Expect this case to go on for many more years.
*   **Big Picture:** The decision comes just weeks after the federal government carried out its [first three executions](https://www.bop.gov/about/history/federal_executions.jsp) since 2003.
