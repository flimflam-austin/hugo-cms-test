*   Similar to well-publicized incidents of COVID-19 in meatpacking facilities, farming communities feel the impact of the pandemic amongst fruit-packers and pickers.
*   Some large producers are setting up temporary housing to try to isolate workers, delaying migrant worker arrivals by stalling guest worker programs.
*   Rising concern amongst farmers and losing crops to a lack of workers.
*   Farm unions: “The carnage is skyrocketing” (Erik Nicholson, national vice president for United Farm Workers union)~ rising concern about lack of safety precautions, social distancing for farm workers.

The ripple effects have potential to impact what’s ultimately available to consumers.
