*   On October 12, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) [announced](\"https://www.jnj.com/our-company/johnson-johnson-temporarily-pauses-all-dosing-in-our-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-clinical-trials\") it will pause all of its single-dose and two-dose regimen trials, including its Phase III [ENSEMBLE](\"https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/covid-19-phase-3-study-clinical-protocol\") trial, which began in September and aimed to enroll up to 60,000 participants.
    *   We don’t know exactly what the “unexplained illness” involves, but J&J notes that study pauses due to adverse events are common.
        *    Just last month, U.K.- based drug company, AstraZeneca paused its Phase III vaccine trials worldwide due to an unexplained illness. Trials have resumed in many countries, including the United Kingdom, but not in America.
    *   On Tuesday, J&J’s head of research & development [said](\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-johnson-johnson/jj-says-review-of-illness-that-led-to-pause-of-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-could-take-days-idUSKBN26Y01Q\") the company is investigating the matter, but that he doesn’t know whether the participant received the vaccine or a placebo.
*   It can take up to a decade for vaccines to go through the research and approval process, but J&J said it hopes to be able to supply over a 1 billion vaccine doses next year .
*   **BIG PICTURE:** There’s a historic vaccine development race underway, with more than [40](\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html\") COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials currently underway. About a quarter of those trials are Phase III (the last stage before approval) – including at least two now-paused J& J trials.
