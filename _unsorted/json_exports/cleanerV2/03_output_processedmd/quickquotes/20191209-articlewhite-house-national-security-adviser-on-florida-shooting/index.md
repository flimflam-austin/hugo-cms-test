  summary: White House National Security Adviser on Florida shooting
  citation: ''

---
*   National Security Adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien speaking about a Saudi national who opened fire at a naval base in Florida last week.
*   3 sailors died in the attack on Friday; the shooter was killed.
*   The FBI is investigating the shooting as a terror attack.
*   Many questions remain about the shooter, including his motivation, social media and whether he belonged/subscribed to any terrorist organization.
*   **Why It Matters:** This shooting brings up questions about the screening/training of foreigners at U.S. military bases and the ability of someone like the shooter (a foreign national legally in the U.S.) to legally purchase a firearm in states like Florida. The gunman legally purchased the gun used in the attack.

_The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said_
