*   After Country Fresh detected listeria on equipment used in an area near where some products are packaged, it issued a voluntary [recall](\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/country-fresh-voluntary-product-recall\") for its packaged watermelon chunks distributed to RaceTrac and Walmart retail stores in Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas on October 1.
    *   Two days later, the voluntary recall was [expanded](\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/country-fresh-expands-voluntary-recall\") to include pre-cut packaged apples, grapes, mangoes, pineapples, and cantaloupe distributed to Walmart retail stores in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas.
*   Listeria causes listeriosis, which impacts an estimated 1,600 people each year, and kills over 250.  The CDC lists it among the most common and most deadly foodborne illnesses. The infection is prevalent among pregnant women and newborns, senior citizens, and people with compromised immune systems.
    *   Initial symptoms of  listeriosis are flu-like. The [CDC](\"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/faq.html\") notes that “_people with invasive listeriosis usually report symptoms starting 1 to 4 weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria; some people have reported symptoms starting as late as 70 days after exposure or as early as the same day of exposure._“
*   **BIG PICTURE:** In 2018, the [CDC](\"https://www.smarthernews.com/18-08-01-food-recalls/\") announced that foodborne illnesses in America tripled compared to a decade ago. According to latest statistics from the [CDC](\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/2011-foodborne-estimates.html\"), 1 in 6 Americans get sick from a foodborne illness each year. Of those, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die. The [USDA](\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/cdc-and-food-safety.html\") estimates that foodborne illnesses cost more than $15.6 billion each year
