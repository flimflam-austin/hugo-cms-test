*   **Why It Matters:** Once considered a top contender, Harris now joins another dozen democratic candidates who dropped out of the race. Another 16 candidates remain, including four women.
*   In a message to her supporters, Sen. Harris gave this explanation for what some describe as an abrupt exit: “I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.”
*   Harris is the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American U.S. senator.
