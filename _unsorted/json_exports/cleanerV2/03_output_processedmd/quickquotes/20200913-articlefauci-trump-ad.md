*   In the recently released [ad](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emnCFyi5cuQ&ab_channel\"), a narrator says “_President Trump tackled the virus head-on as leaders should_” and then shows an undated clip of the director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci saying  “_**I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more.**“_
*   The clip was from a March Fox News [interview](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqSnWnNuEE&\"). Here’s the full exchange:

> MARK LEVIN: _Dr. Fauci, let me ask you a question. You’ve been doing this a long time. Have you ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat? A health threat?_
> 
> DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: _Well, we’ve never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think is one of them._
> 
> _I mean, we’re talking about all-hands on-deck is that I, as one of many people on a team, I’m not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was. I have been devoting almost full time on this — almost full time._
> 
> _I’m down at the White House virtually every day with the Taskforce. I’m connected by phone throughout the day and into the night and when I say night, I’m talking twelve, one, two in the morning. I’m not the only one. There’s a whole group of us that are doing that. It’s every single day._
> 
> _So I can’t imagine that that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously, we’re fighting a formidable enemy — this virus. This virus is a serious issue here._

*   Dr. Fauci noted that he has never publicly endorsed any political candidate and that he doesn’t plan to do so now.
*   In response to the controversy surrounding the ad, on Tuesday Pres. Trump [said](\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1315414353105960960\") “_They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words. We have done a “phenomenal” job, according to certain governors. Many people agree…And now come the Vaccines & Cures, long ahead of projections!”_
