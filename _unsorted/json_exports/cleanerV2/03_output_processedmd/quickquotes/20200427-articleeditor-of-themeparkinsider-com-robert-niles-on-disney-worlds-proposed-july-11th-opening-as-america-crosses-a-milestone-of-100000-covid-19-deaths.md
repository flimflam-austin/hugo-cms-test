*   Disney’s collection of 12 theme parks worldwide include the world’s most-visited theme park in Florida: Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.

*   Changes include mandatory masks for guests and employees.
*   **Why It Matters:** The proposed reopening is important for Disney – a company that relies on the billions of dollars in theme park revenues each year – but also as a potential symbolic leader for the tourism industry overall about what’s possible (and what’s not) to reopen, and to stay in operation, during a global pandemic.
