*   Previously, the CDC said the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 depended mainly on larger respiratory droplets, transmitted by an infected person within relatively close proximity to another, when coughing, singing, or even talking. **This is the reason behind guidance for social distancing and mask-wearing.**
*   Now the CDC says the guidance should include **airborne transmission** – meaning a tiny particle, released when even breathing, may hang in the air longer than a typical respiratory droplet, opening up the potential scenarios someone \*may\* get infected.
*   This puts the new coronavirus in a category like **chicken pox and measles** of diseases that may be spread through airborne droplets.
*   The World Health organization says airborne transmission is when a particle _“remains infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time_.”
*   The CDC offers **this qualifier**: _“There is evidence that under **certain conditions**, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away. These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation. Sometimes the infected person was breathing heavily, for example while singing or exercising.”_ 
*   A variety of different [health professionals have asked the CDC for months to include this guidance,](\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html\") thinking it would add a more complete understanding of the threat of infection and mask policies.
*   Several weeks ago the CDC published what it described as a ‘draft’ of this notable change to the main CDC website and then retracted it, saying it was premature.
*   **Why It Matters:** In the immediate, this reflects a broadening of ways COVID-19 can be transmitted.  It puts further emphasis on mask-wearing as a potential layer of protection.
*   **What to Watch For:** We’ll watch to see if this revelation changes any policies within states for indoor dining, education, recreational activities, and beyond.
