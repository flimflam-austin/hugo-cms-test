*   Fighting began on September 27th – The exact source that led to the eruption of hostilities also remains disputed.
*   Reports include civilian deaths, violence fighting, use of drones, and the hiring of outside militia (specifically Syrian militia by Turkey to fight on behalf of Azerbaijan).
*   Turkey and Russia, two bordering nations, have vested interests. Turkey backs the Azerbaijan; Russia has tried to play peace maker and negotiated a cease fire that has not held.  Armenia has reached to the West, specifically the U.S., for more direct support but the results remain TBD.
*   Why This Matters: Turkey is a member of NATO – an alliance that includes the United States. Foreign policy analysts worry a local conflict can spill over to include major powers (like Russia and Turkey) more directly.
