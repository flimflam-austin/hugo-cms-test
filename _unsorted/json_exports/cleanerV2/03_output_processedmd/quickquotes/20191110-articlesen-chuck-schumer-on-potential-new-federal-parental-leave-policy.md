*   Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says the new parental leave policy would give **federal workers** up to 12 weeks **paid** time-off for parental leave.
*   Reports: New paid time-off policy part of a compromise between democrats and republicans on a new defense bill that will help fund departments like America’s new “Space Force.”
*   **Why It Matters:** Federal policy may help influence private company policy on parental leave. Existing paid time-off policies vary state to state and company to company. No federal law requires paid parental leave for parents.
