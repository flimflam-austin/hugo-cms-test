*   Researchers used nasal swabs to collect data on a group of 145 POSITIVE COVID-19 patients.
*   The **group tested under the age of five** showed evidence of **carrying ten-to-100 times greater** than the other age groups.
*   The researchers measured evidence of the virus, not how contagious or infectious.
