*   Dr. Kluge [said](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/europe-chief-coronavirus-long-lasting-tornado-72653647) that over half of the European region territories are reporting over 10% increases in 14-day new infection rates, calling it “_an uptick which is generalized in Europe_.”
*   Dr. Kluge [warned](https://wtop.com/europe/2020/08/who-europe-chief-cites-coronavirus-warning-signs-ahead/) that the increase in cases among the young could negatively impact older and more vulnerable populations as we enter the fall with the flu season, children returning to school, and families moving to more indoor activities
*   **BIG PICTURE:** What’s happening in Europe might tell us something about what might happen here, especially as many American children are getting ready to go back to school in the coming  days behind their [European counterparts](https://apnews.com/fe75eccd704b83c8f4555719dc0d99a4).  German students have already returned to the classroom, and children in France, Spain, and the U.K. will head back next week.
