In the aftermath of last week’s riot at the U.S. Capitol several lawmakers have called for the President to resign, be impeached, or be removed under the 25th Amendment — most are Democrats, but some are Republicans.

*   Ahead of [Sen. Toomey](\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-10-2021-n1253663\")‘s remarks on Sunday, [Sen. Lisa Murkowski](\"ttps://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/\") (R-AK) became the first sitting senator to call for the President’s resignation, stating he’s “_caused enough damage,_” on Friday.
    *   \*IF\* Pres. Trump were to resign, he’d be only the second president to do so. In 1976, [Pres. Nixon](\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/richard-m-nixon/\") resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
*   Draft [articles of impeachment](\"https://www.scribd.com/document/490165056/Articles-of-Impeachment-Incitement-of-Insurrection-pdf-4#from_embed\") have been drawn up by the House of Representatives against Pres. Trump for  “incitement of insurrection” and [House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn](\"https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/house-vote-on-trump-impeachment-will-happen-this-week-rep-clyburn\") (D-SC) said the House will vote on them this week.
    *   \*IF\* the House votes in favor of the articles of impeachment, it’s unclear how quickly the impeachment process would play out.
        *   Remember: Impeachment is complicated process. [CLICK HERE](\"https://smarthernews.com/impeachment-history/\") for an impeachment refresher.
*   A day after the riot at the U.S. Capitol, U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) announced he’s calling for 25th Amendment be invoked “_for the sake of our democracy_.”
    *   \*IF\* you hear people talking about the 25th Amendment, they’re probably referencing Section 4, which allows the Vice President and a majority of the President’s Cabinet declare the president unfit, allowing the Vice President to becomes acting president.
        *   On Monday, the [House](\"https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1348415150018195457/photo/1\") will vote on a bill calling on Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment.
