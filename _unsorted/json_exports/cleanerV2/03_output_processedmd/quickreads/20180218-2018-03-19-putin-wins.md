    Putin in Power

    --------------


    Under current term limits, this would be his **LAST TERM**.


    Putin has spent 14 years as President, spent 4 years & 2 stints as Prime
    Minister.


    Another 6 year term extends his lock on power to **24 years**, longer than
    any Russian leader since Soviet Joseph Stalin (12 years).

    Putin: Alleged Poisoning

    ------------------------


    *   Russia accused last week of using a nerve agent to attack 2 UK citizens
    (one a former Russian spy). World leaders, including U.S., condemned attack.

    *   First public comments: Putin says it’s “nonsense” to think Russia would
    be involved before major election or before hosting World Cup this summer,
    but he’s ready to cooperate with investigation.
