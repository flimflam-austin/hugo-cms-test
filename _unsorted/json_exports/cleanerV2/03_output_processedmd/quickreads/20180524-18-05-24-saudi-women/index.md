    “Ban” Basics

    ------------


    Saudi Arabia: **only country in world where women can’t drive.**


    No official law prohibits women from driving butA **only men are allowed to
    obtain driver’s licenses**.A This changes on June 24 when women can get a
    driver’s license – part of a reform plan called “Vision 2030”

    Saudi Arabia follows ‘**Wahhabism**‘, a form of Islam that says women:


    *   should be separated from men they are not related to

    *   wear veils to cover themselves while in public

    *   be accompanied by a male guardian (usually a relative or husband) unless
    they receive written permission from a male guardian

    Why Now?

    --------


    *   Crown Prince recently visited U.S., spoke about reform, including for
    women. **He lobbied & secured major investment based on “Vision2030”.**

    *   In the past, he’s suddenly arrested groups of business men &
    controversial Islamic clerics.

    *   Women under arrest reportedly called “**traitors**” by govt but **little
    other explanation exists**.
