    BRAIN POWER

    ===========


    As America continues to honor Sen. John McCain,A brain cancer research
    delivers quiteA literallyA **mind-altering innovations.**

    Why Do We Call It Cancer?

    -------------------------


    > “The word cancer is derived from the Latin word for crab because cancers
    are often very irregularly shaped, and because, like a crab, they “grab on
    and don’t let go.”

    > 

    > Johns Hopkins University describes cancer as irregular cell growth that
    can turn deadly. Est. 1 out of 100 cancer diagnoses will be brain cancer;
    it's also the second most common form of cancer in children (behind
    Leukemia).

    Brain Cancer Boost?

    -------------------


    (beyond radiation, chemo & surgery)


    *   **Cancer Vaccines & Immunotherapy:** Help the body recognize a brain
    tumor as an “invader” and attack it.

    *   **Tumor Treating Fields or TTF:** A wearable device (like a cap) that
    uses electric fields to disrupt tumor growth (forA glioblastoma -the cancer
    Sen. McCain had).

    Novocure, the company using Tumor Treatment Fields, received FDA approval
    for treating Glioblastoma using its device (with chemotherapy). It's also
    working on a device for lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.

    Treatment innovations  
    Brain cancer research is a very active field of study. Researchers are investigating new ways to deliver drugs to brain tumors, including pumps that release a continuous, slow flow of chemotherapy or targeted drug therapies to a tumor. This type of treatment is called convection-enhanced delivery (CED).  
    Another type of therapy uses technology called tumor treating fields (Optune) to deliver electric fields to the brain, which can help stop the proliferation of cancer cells. Optune is a wearable, portable device and is used in combination with temozolomide to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults.  
    Implanted, biodegradable wafer therapy (Gliadel) relies on an implanted disc to release chemotherapy to tumor tissue that remains after surgery. And in nanoparticle therapy, particles with an unusually high surface area carry chemotherapy across the blood-brain barrier directly to a tumor.
