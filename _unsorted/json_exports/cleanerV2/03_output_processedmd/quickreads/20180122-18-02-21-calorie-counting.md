    Study by Journal of the American Medical Association

    ----------------------------------------------------


    *   Goal: To test whether genetics determines what diets work for certain
    people and not others.

    *   Findings: **Quality over quantity mattered.** Type of food, not
    calories, led to weight loss.

    *   BTW: Genetics alone doesn’t determine ability to lose weight.
