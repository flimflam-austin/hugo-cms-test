    Why Pres Was Angry:

    -------------------


    _“I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact
    that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the
    Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is
    desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.”_  

    Pres. Trump, @Twitter, Friday March 24, 2018 8:55 a.m.

    For Your Consideration:

    -----------------------


    *   If Pres. did not sign spending bill by Saturday, gov’t would’ve shut
    down for the 3rd time this year, but ultimately he signed it.

    *   The issue of immigration reform and $$ for a border wall (not a fence)
    continue to linger.

    Interesting Side-Story:

    -----------------------


    *   Despite the spending bill passing with majority support, one senator
    tried to derail it.

    *   Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch didn’t like that his late “nemesis” was
    getting a forest renamed after him & tried to stop the bill passing because
    of it.

    *   Proving the 2200+ page bill may have a lot of overlooked line items.

    _Therea\\u0019s money for fencing, but no wall._  
    _Nowhere was the dynamic on more vivid display than on Mr. Trumpa\\u0019s cherished proposal to spend tens of billions of dollars on a wall on the nationa\\u0019s border with Mexico.The bill includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security a\\u0014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers a\\u0014 but not Mr. Trumpa\\u0019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. That includes $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing that was previously authorized under the 2006 Secure Fence Act, passed during the George W. Bush administration. But the measure prohibits building a concrete wall or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.The measure also explicitly rejects Mr. Trumpa\\u0019s plan for a hiring spree of border officers, an idea critics have condemned as an attempt to unleash a a\\u001cdeportation force.a\\u001d The president signed an executive order during his first week in office last year calling for 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and he sought 2,000 in his budget request.
