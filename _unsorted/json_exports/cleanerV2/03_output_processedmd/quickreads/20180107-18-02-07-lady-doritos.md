    DUBNER: So is there a male and female version of chips that youa\\u0019re playing with, or no?  
    NOOYI: Ita\\u0019s not a male and female as much as a\\u001care there snacks for women that can be designed and packaged differently?a\\u001d And yes, we are looking at it, and wea\\u0019re getting ready to launch a bunch of them soon. For women,A low-crunch, the full taste profile, not have so much of the flavor stick on the fingers, and how can you put it in a purse? Because women love to carry a snack in their purse. The whole design capability we built in PepsiCo was to allow design to work with innovation. Not just on packaging colors, but to go through the entire cycle, and say, a\\u001cAll the way to the product in the pantry, or how ita\\u0019s being carried around, or how they eat it in the car, or drink it in the car, what should be the design of the product, the package, the experience, so that we can influence the entire chain?a\\u001d
