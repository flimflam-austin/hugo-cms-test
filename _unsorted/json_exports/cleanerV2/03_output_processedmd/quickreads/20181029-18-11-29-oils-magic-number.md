    Oil’s Slippery Slope

    --------------------


    *   **What?** Oil traded at 4-year high in October at **$76/barrel** and the
    talk at that time was that $100/barrel was next. Today, it’s trading below
    **$50/barrel**.

    *   **Why?** There’s **too much oil**. U.S. crude inventories have **climbed
    10-straight weeks** to the highest level in a year, just as concerns grow
    over a **global economic slowdown** with less oil demand.

    What is the Perfect Price?

    --------------------------


    > Goldman Sachs warns $50/barrel oil is not good for America, instead says a
    $65 to $70/barrel range is best for all.

    > _“When you’re in that level it’s not too high & damaging the consumer, but
    at the same time, it creates a stable environment for the industry.”_

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    As of August, **U.S. is now the world’s largest oil producer**. Falling
    prices may weigh heavily on an industry that now represents a larger share
    of the U.S. economy.


    While lower oil prices boost consumers, ultimately energy producers will be
    forced to cut back, laying off workers which may send prices ultimately
    spiking higher.

    Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets Dec. 6th. Its de
    facto leader Saudi Arabia is arguing for a cut in supplies to prevent a
    glut. But first, strategists will watch Friday's G20 meeting, including the
    Saudis, Russia, & U.S., for hints on what's next.
