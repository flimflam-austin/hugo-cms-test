    Why Such Drama?  


    ------------------


    *   Qualcomm = crown jewel of the United States tech industry.

    *   Its chips are used in most mobile phones, and its semiconductors will be
    used in the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks known as 5G.

    *   Whoever buys it, buys its competitive advantage AND literally a way “in”
    to our electronics.

    possible gov’t spying.

    *   U.S. Govt intervention is unusual because the deal is not finalized.

    The U.S. Govt Fears…

    --------------------


    \*If\* Broadcom takes over a major U.S. company (Qualcomm), leadership will
    prioritize short-term profits & cut back on research, causing America to
    lose its competitive advantage, especially in 5G (5G = 5th generation
    ultra-fast wireless connections) and allow Chinese competitors to gain
    ground.
