    Something To Consider:  


    -------------------------


    When asked, high school students thought differently than their elders.


    “Those 18 and older said by 54%-33% that tightening gun laws and background
    checks would prevent more mass shootings in the United States. Those under
    18 were less confident about that; they said by 47%-37% that taking those
    steps would work.”

    How Much Money?  

    TBD: “The Hill” Reports:

    ------------------------------------------


    *   No specific $$ amount for firearm research.

    *   Bill authorizes $649M of your tax money for CDC to look into “Injury
    Prevention and Control activities.”

    *   Some say without specific research purpose, approved by Congress, no $$
    will \*actually\* be devoted to gun-related research despite clarification.
