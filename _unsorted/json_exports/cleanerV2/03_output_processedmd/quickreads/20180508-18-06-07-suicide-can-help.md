    had rates increase by 30%.

    Why A Dramatic Increase?

    ------------------------


    **No simple answer.** Suicide is not JUST attributable to substance abuse,
    mental illness, or any single cause. Some experts say economic downturns
    played a role between 1999-2016 yet…


    *   4 out of 10 suicide cases reported relationship problems,

    *   29% – a crisis in the recent weeks

    *   22% – physical health problem.
