    valuable company ever at  

    $1,000,000,000,000.


    Why some say the focus on the $$$$ may miss the point of the company’s true
    value.

    iPhone Center Stage

    -------------------


    *   **Apple now worth more than all but 26 countries in the world.A**

    *   **Why?** Better than expected iPhone sales in its latest earnings report
    pushed the stock higher.

    *   Stock price impacts the worth of the company or “market cap.”

    *   Apple “beat” expectations, but some analysts lowered #’s wks ago because
    of concerns re: iPhone sales.

    Food for thought: Apple makes many of its products in China, where trade
    tensions run high w/U.S. re: tariffs. One commentator says companies with
    the highest market cap often underperform in the years ahead. Read his
    analysis on our source page.
