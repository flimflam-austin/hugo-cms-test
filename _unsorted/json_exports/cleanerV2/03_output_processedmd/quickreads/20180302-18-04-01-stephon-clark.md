*   **What are the real numbers on police shootings?A** The latest CDC stats are from 2016, when police killed 549 people (118 black & 306 white (non-Hispanic)). However, those #s don’t reflect the fact that blacks make up less than 14% of pop, so it is important to look at the rate per 100,000 people. **While we know the race of the victims, we \*often\* don’t know the race of the police officers.A**  
    Black RateA = .26  
    White (non-Hispanic) Rate = .15  
    **For comparison:** In the city of Chicago in 2016, 764 people died in shooting homicides.A Approximately 79% of them or 596 were black.
