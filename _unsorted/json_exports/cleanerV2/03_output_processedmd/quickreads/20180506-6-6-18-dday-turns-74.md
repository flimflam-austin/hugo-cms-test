*   **June 6, 1944 73rd anniversary of D-Day**:_A_ [https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/june\_6\_1944\_73rd\_anniversary\_o.html](\"https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/june_6_1944_73rd_anniversary_o.html\")

_What does the “D” in D-Day stand for? U.S. Commander Gen. David Eisenhower later clarified its meaning, writing in 1964 that “any amphibious operation has a departed date; therefore, the shortened term D-Day is used.”_

_That’s why military historians will tell you the Normandy invasion was just one of several D-Days of World War II. Every amphibious assault – including those in the Pacific, North Africa, Sicily and Italy- had its own D-Day, the Army said._
