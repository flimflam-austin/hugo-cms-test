    Something To Consider

    ---------------------


    **“Right to Try” does NOT guarantee ACCESS or AFFORDABILITY**


    *   Insurance companies are NOT required to cover experimental treatments.

    *   Drug manufacturers are NOT mandated to undergo clinical trials OR
    provide experimental drugs OR produce large enough amt of drugs to ensure
    availability.

    Under its Expanded Access (Compassionate Use) program, the FDA already
    authorizes over 99% of expanded access requests it receives. But for some,
    it's still not fast enough. Read more about the program here:
