    Why This Matters
    ================

    Questions To Ask of FBI:
    ------------------------

    *   Is this incompetence?
    *   Is this an issue of manpower?
    *   Is this an issue of volume – too many calls, not enough resources?
    *   Is this a failure of technology?
    *   Where was the missing link?

FBI Statement on the Shooting in Parkland, Florida  
On January 5, 2018, a person close to Nikolas Cruz contacted the FBIa\\u0019s Public Access Line (PAL) tipline to report concerns about him. The caller provided information about Cruza\\u0019s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.

Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life. The information then should have been forwarded to the FBI Miami Field Office, where appropriate investigative steps would have been taken.

We have determined that these protocols were not followed for the information received by the PAL on January 5. The information was not provided to the Miami Field Office, and no further investigation was conducted at that time.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said:

a\\u001cWe are still investigating the facts. I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public. Ita\\u0019s up to all Americans to be vigilant, and when members of the public contact us with concerns, we must act properly and quickly.

a\\u001cWe have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy. All of the men and women of the FBI are dedicated to keeping the American people safe, and are relentlessly committed to improving all that we do and how we do it.a\\u001d
