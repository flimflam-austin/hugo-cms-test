    What’s The Breakthrough?

    ------------------------


    *   For decades, researchers believed a protein (**CGRP**) was connected to
    migraines.

    *   By blocking \*some\* of these proteins on a cellular level, migraines
    lessen.

    *   Other big drug companies are working on similar treatments – **Could
    this change the course of migraine treatment forever?**
