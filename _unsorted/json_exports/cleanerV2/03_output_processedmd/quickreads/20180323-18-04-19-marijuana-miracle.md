_From New York Times:_

_Runners also report using products with cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive component of marijuana that has shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, for recovery. The CBD is usually applied through an oil. a\\u001c**It lowers the amount of many, many pro-inflammatory cytokines a\\u0014 things that our body makes naturally in response to any inflammation response**,a\\u001d said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Health, who is studying the use of CBD to treat epilepsy. He said that CBD has also been shown to bind to serotonin receptors, a\\u001c**which may be related to its effect as an anti-anxiety agent.a\\u001d**_

_Scott Dunlap, a 48-year-old ultrarunner who calls himself a semiprofessional (he has sponsors but also a day job) and who once ran a race in a marijuana leaf costume, says he will use an edible or vape marijuana after a long race. (**He tried it once during a run and said he wound up a\\u001clost and hungry.a\\u001d**) He doesna\\u0019t see using marijuana after running a race as all that different from drinking a beer a\\u0014 except that a lot of races provide beer free._
