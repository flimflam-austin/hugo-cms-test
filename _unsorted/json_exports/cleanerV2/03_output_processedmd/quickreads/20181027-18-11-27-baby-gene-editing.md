    DESIGNER BABIES?

    ----------------


    A Chinese researcher claims he’s **the first** to create genetically-edited
    babies – the **secretive process** and **timing** raising questions all over
    the world.


    Science Bombshell?

    Background

    ----------


    *   **What is gene editing?** Technology allowing scientists to remove,
    repair or replace the DNA of living cells. (i.e. plants, animals, humans.)

    *   **Why do it?** Power to eliminate disease or correct genetic issues.

    *   **Is it legal?** U.S. scientists can experiment with human embryos but
    cannot implant these embryos to produce actual pregnancies.

    The Basics: Reports

    -------------------


    *   Chinese researcher,A He Jiankui, says he modified genes during IVF, to
    make babiesA **resistant to HIV.**

    *   Couples (all fathers HIV positive) recruited to participate.

    *   Results, **which have yet to be vetted,** focus on twin girls: only one
    twin had both copies of the genes altered, meaning the **other is still at
    risk.**

    > “If true, this experiment is monstrous. The embryos were healthy. No known
    diseases.”

    > 

    > Julian Savulescu, University of Oxford director of the Oxford Uehiro
    Centre for Practical Ethics, describing the experiment as "genetic Russian
    roulette." Experts argue there are many other effective ways to counter HIV
    if one does get it.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   Experiments are vetted (peer scientists examine data & results); this
    one has not…yet.

    *   Experts question whether study was **necessary**, **safe**, or
    **ethical**.A Unintended genetic edits may do more harm than good.

    *   A pioneer of gene editing, reacting to the news of the study,A called
    for a “moratorium on implantation of edited embryos.”

    Today in Hong Kong a huge conference on humane genome editing is taking
    place. The researcher will present his findings, though the organizers say
    they had no knowledge of his work, made public right before this
    international event.
