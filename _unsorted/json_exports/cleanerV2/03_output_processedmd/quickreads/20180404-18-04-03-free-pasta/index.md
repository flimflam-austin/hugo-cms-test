    But…Why Did Pasta Lead To Weight Loss?

    --------------------------------------


    Researchers aren’t 100% sure…but say : _“lower-GI foods have been shown to
    be **more satiating** and **delay hunger** and **decrease subsequent energy
    intake.**_


    Translation? **A little pasta may have made eaters feel fuller, longer.**
