    What’s At Stake

    ---------------


    *   Current PM (Haidar al-Abadi) seen as more independent, more
    U.S.-friendly, than his challengers, who align more closely with Iran,
    politically or religiously.

    *   Who wins will determine future relationship of U.S. & Iraq.

    *   ISIS led to massive displacement of **diverse Iraqi population**. Next
    leader will have a major role in Iraq’s demographics & geography.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   **RECORD LOW turnout at 44%**. Turnout usually approx. 60% _(that
    roughly matches voter turnout in America’s 2016 presidential election_).

    *   First election since the start of the Iraq war (2003) whereA **no
    bombings were reported at ANY polling site**.

    No clear winner...yet. Once parliament is elected in Iraq (nearly 400
    seats), members have 3 months to form a government. A coalition of
    politicians backed by Muqtada Al-Sadr has an early lead. Sadr led a militia
    that fought/killed U.S. troops during Iraq War.
