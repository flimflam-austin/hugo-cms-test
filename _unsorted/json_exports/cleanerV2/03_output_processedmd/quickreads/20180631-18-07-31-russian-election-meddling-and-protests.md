    What Happened?

    --------------


    *   American utility companies infiltrated by Russian hackers **over the
    last 2 years**.

    *   Russians used **phishing scams** (where a fake email prompts the user to
    change their password & hacker gets the info) to infiltrate systems and
    steal data.

    *   Number and extent of attacks is reportedly unknown.

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    “extensive damage and potentially lengthy blackouts” (WSJ)


    Russian hackers have access to control panels in several of America’s power
    plants (NYT).


    Russians could hypothetically access these control rooms through remote
    control (and they’ve done it before in Ukraine).
