    Democrats Claim:

    ----------------


    *   In late July 2016, the FBI started its investigation into Carter Page,
    but didn’t receive the infamous “dossier” (a research document created by an
    anti-Trump firm hired by democrats) until more than 6 weeks later.

    *   This goes against GOP allegations FBI officials relied on slanted
    political material (dossier) to justify surveillance of Page.

    country had they not sought…to conduct temporary surveillance of Carter
    Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian government.”

    done. SO ILLEGAL!”

    Why This Matters:

    =================


    *   U.S. government cannot spy on citizens without a warrant.

    *   Republicans say Dept of Justice (DOJ) used biased political material to
    justify the warrant.

    *   Democrats say DOJ only used political material AFTER other reasons
    justified the warrant.

    *   Either way, political material mentioned in a case to spy on an
    American. **Slippery Slope.A**
