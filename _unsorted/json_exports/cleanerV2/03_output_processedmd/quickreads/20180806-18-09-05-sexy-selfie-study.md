    Selfie Study

    ------------


    *   Researchers looked at social media posts in 183 countries.

    *   **Results:** More “sexy selfies” come from places, like U.S., where
    women have more opportunities.

    *   **Why?** Researchers say areas with greater upward mobility often have
    higher income inequality.

    *   Analysis:A **Sexy selfies “sell”**; reflect desire to climb in social
    status.

    with other women**,A for higher status, and finding a mate.

    "In evolutionary terms, these kinds of behaviors are completely rational,

    the things they do to put themselves at the top of the hierarchy are really
