    It Ain’t Easy…  

    Being Cheesy

    =============================


    Whether its mac & cheese or mozzarella, cheese prices fall as **America’s
    stock of the dairy delight hits a 100-year record-high**.

    Wait…Cheese Stockpiles?

    -----------------------


    *   America’s agriculture department keeps track of its cheese inventory.
    The gov’t has a record of cheese stockpiles since 1917!

    *   Compared to last year at the same time we have 6% more cheese in
    America.

    *   Why? Too much milk. Milk often made into cheese to preserve it. Also,
    summer months = less lunches packed. And tariffs.

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   **U.S. families:** Cheese prices drop. We have plenty of cheese, but not
    enough demand for it.

    *   **U.S. dairy farmers:** In addition to stockpiles, cheese exports hit by
    Mexico/Canada tariffs in retaliation for our tariffs on steel & aluminum.
    This adds more pressure on farmers who don’t make a ton of money off of
    cheese (margins tight).

    Bigger Picture

    --------------


    *   Milk consumption has fallen despite theA “Got Milk?” ads first
    introduced in the mid-1990s by the dairy industry to try to encourage
    consumption.

    *   Americans picking other non-dairy options like almond milk.

    *   Insight from one industry exec: While yogurt producers have innovated
    (pouches, squeeze packs), milk producers haven’t.

    The price of cheese impacts the price farmers receive for milk, so it
    impacts the entire dairy industry. Despite current pressures, one analyst is
    optimistic the industry will regulate. Read more on SmartHERNews.com

*   **Cheese prices crumble a\\u0014 but the global trade dispute could halt their drop:**  
    [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cheese-prices-crumble-but-the-global-trade-dispute-could-halt-their-drop-2018-07-13](\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cheese-prices-crumble-but-the-global-trade-dispute-could-halt-their-drop-2018-07-13?link=sfmw_tw\")_  
    Roger Orth, an independent market maker, points out that China and Mexico are two of the largest destinations for U.S. dairy products a\\u001cby a wide margin.a\\u001d Theya\\u0019ve both implemented tariffs on cheese, in retaliation to U.S. tariffs. U.S. dairy exports to Mexico totaled $1.3 billion in 2017, while China took in $577 million in dairy exports from the U.S., according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council.  
    __a\\u001cBeing involved in a trade war with \[two of the\] largest importers of U.S. dairy products has the potential to really change the demand side of the equation for our products,a\\u001d says Orth. a\\u001cWe are seeing the impact now. The question is just how long it lasts.a\\u001d  
    __In the long run, however, the tariffs may end up being good for the market. a\\u001cThe tariffs are painful now,a\\u001d but ita\\u0019s possible they are a\\u001csetting us up for a a\\u0018perfect storm,a\\u0019 a\\u001d says Tim Oa\\u0019Leary, an independent dairy trader. a\\u001cWith the declining dairy prices, we will have more farms closing up.a\\u001d  
    __a\\u001cShould we get back to a a\\u0018truea\\u0019 balance of trade, I have to wonder what new and increased demands on our dairy market will do to the current prices,a\\u001d he says._
