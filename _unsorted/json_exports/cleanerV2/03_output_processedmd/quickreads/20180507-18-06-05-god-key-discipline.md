    The Findings:

    -------------


    *   Catholic school students are **less disruptive**, exhibited **more
    self-control** and **respect** than public AND private school students.

    *   One Disclaimer: _“Families who send their children to Catholic schools
    make a conscious choice to do so, they likely differ from other families in
    unobservable ways.”_

    Big Picture

    -----------


    *   Current Education Debate: **Should we approach school discipline
    differently?** Especially becauseA of “differential suspension rates for
    minority and non-minority students”?

    *   Study accounted for “race, gender, socioeconomic status, & family
    immigrant status” & arrived at same result. The authors have a few theories
    as to why.

    T_hat doesna\\u0019t mean that such secular approachesa\\u0014and schoolsa\\u0014dona\\u0019t have their place. Of course they do. And so do character education, ethics classes, and civics, all of which can contribute to the development of self-discipline. School leaders should choose the options that best suit their kids and culture._  
    _That said, our results suggest that Catholic schools in particular are doing something meaningful in the realm of self-discipline. So ita\\u0019s deeply unfair that the politics of education continue to prevent many parents from accessing them, and ita\\u0019s a tragedy for the nation that many of these valuable educational institutions continue to close. To the extent that school choice programs can widen access to great schoolsa\\u0014Catholic or otherwisea\\u0014that boost academic performance and self-discipline, they deserve our eternal support._
