    President Trump takes on Amazon.

    More than 6 out of 10 American households have an Amazon “Prime” Membership.

    But is this part of a bigger deal that no one is watching?

    > “Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes
    money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our
    fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country…not a
    level playing field!”

    Post Office Problem$

    --------------------


    *   U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is bleeding money (lost $2.7B last yr, **$63B
    since 2007**), mostly due to pension & health care costs.

    *   Pkg delivery a source of revenue, but not enough to cover losses.

    *   USPS has “deal” with Amazon but we don’t know the specifics (USPS is
    independently operated and makes deals with retailers outside of gov’t
    oversight).

    > “I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike
    others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our
    Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.),
    and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!”

    Fact Check:  

    Is Amazon A Tax Cheat?

    ------------------------------------


    *   One of largest U.S. companies, but pays nearly $0 in fed’l taxes (by
    using tax breaks & credits)

    *   Amazon paid $957M in income taxes in 2017.

    *   Amazon \*used\* to not collect sales tax (arguably hurting state/local
    govt), but has since ’17.

    *   Amazon uses USPS to deliver pkgs because it’s cheaper. Period.

    Fox Business Anchor & Harvard Business School Grad, Melissa Francis, says
    the tweets on Amazon are all part of the President's plan to negotiate
    Amazon DOWN on a completely separate government contract. She says this is a
    pattern...

*   **SmartHer Take**: Amazon didn’t cause the U.S. postal service’s downfall, but it usually pays less using USPS than it would from other big corps (FedEx & UPS), and like other big corps, it pays taxes, but benefits from tax breaks / loopholes.
