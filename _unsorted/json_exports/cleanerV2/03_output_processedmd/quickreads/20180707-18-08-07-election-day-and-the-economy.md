    The BIG Picture

    ---------------


    *   AP analysis: Important counties in swing states have not seen job
    losses; areas that backed Clinton in 2016 have better job growth than areas
    that voted for Pres. Trump.

    *   Pew Research poll raises question about whether or not jobs are the TOP
    priority for voters during this particular midterm election.

    What To Watch: Aug 7

    --------------------


    *   **Ohio:** Important swing state. President Trump held rally in Ohio on
    Saturday.

    *   In Focus: **A special election for Congress.** Polls show a
    traditionally Republican district with a very tight race.

    *   **Democrats need to flip 24 seats from R to D.** Will this be one for
    them?

How well they can talk to both at the same time a\x14 and **how well Republicans do among the same groups** a\x14 will determine whether we see a blue wave or another case of Democratic despair.”_ (NYT)"

*   **Jobs boom favors Democratic counties, not Trump strongholds**_  
    When the Pew Research Center asked voters in June to identify the nationa\\u0019s most pressing issue, more of them chose immigration, race, political gridlock or Trump himself than the economy. The proportion of people who said the economy was their top priority fell to its lowest level in more than eight years._
