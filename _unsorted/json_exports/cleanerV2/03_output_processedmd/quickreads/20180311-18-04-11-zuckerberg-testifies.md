Zuckerberg previously claimed that Facebook is not a media company, and takes no responsibility for what gets posted on the platform. This new admission could spell major changes for tech."

  card_text: "NEW LAWS COMING?\n----------------\n\n> _**a\x1CIa\x19m not the type of person who thinks that all regulation is bad.a\x1D**_\n> \n> **Why it matters:  \n> **Republicans have yet to back it, but the Senate’s #2 Republican John Cornyn says people expect action. That said, in testimony Zuckerberg had to explain Facebook’s basic workings, highlighting how unprepared Congress is to impose game-changing rules."

    Overall, Zuckerberg came out largely unscathed in the nearly 5 hours of
    testimony. Facebook stock rose 4.5% on what investors deemed a positive
    performance. Zuckerberg will appear before the House Energy and Commerce
    Committee at 10AM ET today.
