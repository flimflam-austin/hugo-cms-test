    Copy Machines Have Hard Drives, Too.

    ------------------------------------


    Since 2002, every copier contains a hard drive – like your computer’s –
    storing an image of every document copied, scanned, or emailed.

    a **“pot of gold” for identity thieves.**

    *   Since CBS’s report in 2010, the industry stepped up security with hard
    drive encryption & automatic file scrubbing.

    *   However, aA 2015 Ponemon survey showed **only** **38% of respondents
    were confident printer data was wiped before disposal or refurbishment.  
        **
    *   This \*despite\* federal & some state laws requiring it.
