    What’s the “Nightmare”?

    -----------------------


    *   **Often incurable.**

    *   Each year, 2M Americans become infected with antibiotic-resistant
    bacteria &A 23,000 die.

    *   **221 cases** nationwide in 2017.

    *   Discovered in **27 states.**

    *   More challenging “version” of antibiotic-resistant bacteria found in
    every state.

    Whats YOUR real risk?

    ---------------------


    *   Can be spread person-to-person (without anyone even getting sick).

    *   Spreads via health care equipment (IV, etc).

    *   Higher risk if you receive health care in another country (many with
    “nightmare bacteria” in 2017 had received medical care in another country).

    This is the first time the CDC tracked "nightmare bacteria." CDC Dir. on the
    200+ cases: "I was surprised by the numbers that we found. This was more
    than I was expecting." More of her answer:

**Important:** Context for this study isn’t available – It’s the first of its kind: “..this was the beginning of the surveillance and so ita\\u0019s just the first nine months. I can tell you that I was surprised by the numbers that we found. This was more than I was expecting. But ita\\u0019s the beginning of looking. We hope though that this wona\\u0019t be an inevitable march upward, but that by finding them early when therea\\u0019s only one in the facility we can stop this from becoming very, very common. So we dona\\u0019t have any trend data.” Read More:A [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/t0403-antibiotic-resistant-germs.html](\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/t0403-antibiotic-resistant-germs.html\")
