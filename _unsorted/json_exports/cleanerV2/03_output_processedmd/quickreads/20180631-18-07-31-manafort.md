    US v. Paul Manafort

    ===================


    Pres. Trump’s former campaign manager is the **first to face a criminal
    trial stemming from the Special Counsel** **investigation** into Russian
    interference in the 2016 election.


    Yet **none of the charges** against himA relate to his work on the campaign
    or the President.

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    Manafort faces 18 charges, which although unrelated to the 2016 election,
    are very serious; he could go to prison for the rest of his life.


    Legal experts debate whether Manafort has information that could be
    detrimental to Pres. Trump and, if so, whether he would use it to negotiate?

    Manafort's VA trial is expected to last about three weeks, but delays are
    fairly certain. Either way, his first trial should be done in time before
    his D.C. trial is expected to begin in mid-September.
