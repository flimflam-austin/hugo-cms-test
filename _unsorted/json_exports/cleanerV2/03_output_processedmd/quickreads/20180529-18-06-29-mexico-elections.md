    _Since 2006, the country has pursued a a\\u001cwar on drugsa\\u001d that has cost at least a hundred thousand lives, seemingly to little good effect. LA3pez Obrador, like his opponents, has struggled to articulate a viable security strategy.  
    __After the lunch in CuliacA!n, he took questions, and a woman stood to ask what he intended to do about narcotrafficking. Would he consider the legalization of drugs as a solution? A few months earlier, he had said, seemingly without much deliberation, that he might offer an a\\u001camnestya\\u001d to bring low-level dealers and producers into legal employment. When critics leaped on his remark, his aides tried to deflect criticism by arguing that, because none of the current administrationa\\u0019s policies had worked, anything was worth trying. To the woman in CuliacA!n, he said, a\\u001cWea\\u0019re going to tackle the causes with youth programs, new employment opportunities, education, and by tending to the abandoned countryside. Wea\\u0019re not only going to use force. Wea\\u0019ll analyze everything and explore all the avenues that will let us achieve peace. I dona\\u0019t rule out anything, not even legalizationa\\u0014nothing.a\\u001d The crowd applauded, and amlo looked relieved._
