    ===================


    Riggs (55), a tennis champion and self-proclaimed male chauvinist,
    challenged King (29) a year earlier.

    but she made the shots.**“

    Why King Matters

    ----------------


    In 1971, King was the first female athlete to win over 100K in prizes.


    In 1972, Congress passed Title IX, banning gender discrimination in school
    programs (including sports) that receive federal fund$.


    After her victory against Riggs, King said “**I thought it would set us back
    50 years if I didn’t win that match**.”

    King recently sat down for her first television interview since Serena
    Williams alleged sexism at the US Open. King said sexism still exists in
    tennis, but that "crisis creates opportunity" and this is an opportunity to
    get things right.
