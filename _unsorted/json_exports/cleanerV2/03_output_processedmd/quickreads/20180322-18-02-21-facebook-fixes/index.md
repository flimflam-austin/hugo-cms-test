    Why It Matters:  

    (Even If You Don’t Use FB)

    --------------------------------------------


    Here’s One Reason


    *   Political ads, by law, have to be noted as such.

    *   Reports say FB data was used by a private company to target
    voters/consumers.

    *   Was the material clearly marked as political paid-for ads or was it more
    sinister to sway opinions?

    Big Take Away?

    --------------


    Facebook knew back in 2015 that a professor shared data with a private
    company against their policies.


    Zuckerberg blames that company forA certifying data was erased and lying
    about it.


    Another way to look at it?A Facebook did not insure the data, collected
    against their policies, was erased.

  card_text: "Important To Note:\n------------------\n\n**FB says in 2014 they \\*already\\* made important changes.**\n\n**Before 2014:** when you signed up for an app using your FB Account, your friend’s contact could be accessed without them having the app themselves. **After**: If you sign up for an app, your contacts are protected unless your friends sign up too."

    What FB is doing NOW:

    ---------------------


    1.A Investigate all apps on the platform; audit to make sure they are
    following rules.  

    2\. Restrict access to data. When you use your FB account to sign inA for
    apps, less info will be shared.  

    3\. FB putting an easier way for users themselves to be reminded what apps
    they have and restrict access.

    P.S. Birthdays, Addresses, of you and your friends through your FB accounts
    were easily shared in previous years. Where is all that info now? Who has
    it? What are they doing with it? Some lingering questions...
