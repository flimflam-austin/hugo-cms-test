    FREE SPEECH…  

    Is Not Without Exceptions

    ----------------------------------------


    **Some types of speech have limited or no First Amendment protection,
    including:**


    *   Obscene language

    *   Words likely to incite a breach of peace / violence

    *   **Defamatory statementsA**

    Defamation Law

    ==============


    Plaintiff argues their reputation was harmed by defendant’s false statement
    about them.


    *   False statement & those made “with reckless disregard of the truth” =
    defamatory

    *   True statement =A non-defamatory

    *   **Opinion statement** = non-defamatory IF it can be proven false

    Why This Matters Beyond Jones:

    ==============================


    New technology is like the Wild West.


    Anyone can reach millions.


    The law hasn’t caught up to new communities or new voices made possible by
    this technology. How the law will evolve in this new era is still a
    question.

card_10:
  card_text: >-
    Facebook, YouTube, Apple & Spotify recently removed some of Jones' content
    from their platforms for violating hate speech or bullying policies. Twitter
    did not. Why all the platforms decided to take action now, when Jones has
    posted for years, is unclear.
