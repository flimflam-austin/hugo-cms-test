    =============


    Word-Of-The-Week:

    -----------------


    Psychographic:A mapping a person’s attitudes & interests.

    The Firm  

    Cambridge Analytica

    ------------------------------


    *   Major Investor: Robert Mercer, wealthy Republican.

    *   NYT describes it as a “shell company”, funneling work to a British
    company.

    What’s The Big Deal?

    --------------------


    *   Cambridge Analytica reportedly gave **U.S. political strategy work** to
    a British partner firm, owned by a Brit & run by Europeans. **It’s illegal
    for foreigners to interfere in U.S. elections.**

    *   Some FB users willingly gave data to the professor app that then gave to
    Cambridge Analytica; others did not. Debatable about what’s illegal versus
    unethical.
