    ~ 3 HOT SPOTS ~  
    3 HEADLINES TO KNOW
    -------------------------------------

    **Venezuela**…  
    **Iran**…  
    **Afghanistan**…  
    all in the news this weekend.

    **Here’s What Happened** &

    VENEZUELA: Tinder Box

    ---------------------


    *   Alleged assassination attempt on President Nicholas Maduro during
    outdoor speech Saturday.

    *   Anti-Maduro group took credit for drones (that exploded), but varying
    reports from scene.

    *   **Bottom Line:** Venezuela in crisis; economy collapsing & public
    pressure mounting on Maduro.

    IRAN: Economy Matters

    ---------------------


    *   U.S. will reportedly “snap back” sanctions on Iran from before “nuclear
    deal” early this week. Energy sector (#1 Iran export) sanctions expected in
    Nov.

    *   Pres. Trump tweeted about mtg w/ Iran leadership (or not).

    *   **Backdrop**: Iran economy already struggling & public discontent rising
    w/ gov’t. Often overlooked: major drought adding pressure.

    AFGHANISTAN: Attacks
    --------------------

    *   Taliban & ISIS launched separate attacks over the weekend.
    *   Taliban-led attack on NATO foot patrol; killed 3 Czech soldiers.
    *   1 American injured in attack (FYI: an American also killed mid-July).
    *   Recent Defense Dep’t budget turns focus to China & Russia.
    *   **Bottom Line**: Easy to forget, but U.S. still very much at war.

    The instability (and unpredictability) in Iran & Venezuela, 2 large oil
    producers, has led some to wonder about the impact on the global oil market.
    This could be a big story later this year. There's always a risk of higher
    costs for consumers, but could also benefit U.S. oil producers.
