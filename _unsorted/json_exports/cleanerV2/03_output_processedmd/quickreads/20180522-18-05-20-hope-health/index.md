    Why?  


    -------


    *   Does optimism lead one to pursue better quality of life? i.e. pursuing
    better health, jobs, education = longer lives.

    *   TBD. Researchers found optimism fluctuated and longevity seemed impacted
    as well by $$ or education.

    *   Past Study: Some researchers believe our physiology is healthier when we
    are more hopeful.

    Education may not \*just\* impact optimism, but also employment. The U.S.
    unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma is nearly 6%. With
    a college degree? 1.9% (U.S. unemployment rate: 3.9%).
