    -----------------


    *   Pres. Trump’s star is a site of increasing vandalism & protest.

    *   West Hollywood Mayor said the Council’s resolution urging the star’s
    removal isn’t political, telling CNN:A _“Earning a star … is an honor. When
    one belittles & attacks minorities, immigrants, Muslims, people with
    disabilities or women — the honor no longer exists.”_
