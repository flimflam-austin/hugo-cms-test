    But — there’s a catch!

    ======================


    Making more than $95,000 may make you miserable

    -----------------------------------------------


    Study: After $95,000, people seem less satisfied. Researchers say desires
    such as pursuing more material gains and engaging in social comparisons
    could, ironically, lead to “a lower level of well-being.”
