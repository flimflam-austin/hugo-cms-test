    ===========================


    1 in 3 Americans Impacted

    -------------------------


    Promising more jobs & faster internet, but $26B deal **still needs
    regulators’ blessing** – which hasn’t gone well in the past…

    How Will Deal Affect You?

    -------------------------


    > *   **Less Competition:** U.S. wireless market dominated by 3 players.

    > *   **Closer in Size:**A Tie-up gives T-Mobile/Sprint 100M customers (AT&T
    93M, Verizon 116M).

    > *   **5G:** Faster rollout of a nationwide higher-speed internet network.

    > *   **Higher Bills?:** Unclear, but Economics 101: less competition =
    higher prices.

*   ********How Would a T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Affect Your Cellphone Bill?:

    ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/business/t-mobile-sprint-cellphone-bill.html)**_Will my bill go up?  
    _**_Possibly, but not immediately. It”s difficult to promise that prices will remain at their current levels, even though the companies say consumers should expect the deal to lower prices.__But more competition is generally regarded as better for consumers. After all, look at what happened after regulators denied an attempted merger by T-Mobile and Sprint in 2014.__That year, after regulators signaled they would reject a deal, the two companies began a price war that rippled across the industry. Then in August 2016, T-Mobile was the first carrier in the United States to offer unlimited voice, text and data plans. The next day, Sprint began offering a $100 unlimited voice, text and data plan for two lines. Six months later, Verizon and then AT&T followed with similar offerings. Over all, wireless prices declined 13 percent from March 2016 to March 2017, according to the Labor Department._
