    --------------------------------


    *   Ransomware **locks up your files** until **ransom payment is sent**.

    *   **Exploits flaw** in outdated versions of Windows to gain access.

    *   **Infects one computer & spreads** to entire network.

    *   Microsoft released a patch after attacks in 70+ countries in mid-2017,
    but **unpatched systems remain vulnerable.**

*   Seattle Times: Boeing hit by WannaCry virus, but says attack caused little damage: [https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-hit-by-wannacry-virus-fears-it-could-cripple-some-jet-production/](\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-hit-by-wannacry-virus-fears-it-could-cripple-some-jet-production/\")
*   Is WannaCry Back?  
    Ransomware is malicious software that can lock up your files until you send hackers a ransom payment. It was featured in the WannaCry attacks in May and the NotPetya attacks in June, both of which swept through hospitals, banks and governments in several countries. But after July, the rates of ransomware infections dropped sharply, according to a report from Malwarebytes in January.

*   Boeing Possibly Hit by a\\u0018WannaCrya\\u0019 Malware Attack  
    _WannaCry was first developed at the National Security Agency and later dumped online in 2016 by mysterious hackers called the a\\u001cShadow Brokers.a\\u001d_  
    _That tool, which the N.S.A. code-named Eternal Blue, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software that allowed attackers to spread their malware automatically through vulnerable machines. In other cases, ransomware attackers had to manually encrypt victima\\u0019s systems.__By incorporating the N.S.A.a\\u0019s tool into their ransomware last May, hackers ensured their attack would encrypt as many vulnerable machines as possible, causing maximum disruption. White House officials said North Korea was a\\u001cdirectly responsiblea\\u001d for the attack.
