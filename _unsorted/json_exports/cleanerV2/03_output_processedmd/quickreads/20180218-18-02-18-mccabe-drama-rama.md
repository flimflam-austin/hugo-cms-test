    Why This Matters

    ----------------


    **Andrew McCabe’s firing is part of a larger investigation with high
    stakes.** The DOJ Inspector General is looking into whether or not members
    of the FBI tried to unfairly influence investigations based on political
    beliefs. If the conclusion is yes, that means corruption at the highest law
    enforcement agency in America. **Answer: TBD**

    *   **Timing matters:** Did recommendation come recently, as catalyst behind
    Friday night firing? Or weeks ago and timing chosen by Attorney General
    Sessions right before McCabe’s retirement?
