    Top Lawmakers React To Florida Shooting

    ---------------------------------------


    Gun Law Debate Reemerges


    Simply put the debate focuses on “**Quality vs Quantity**.”


    Does America not have _enough_ gun laws? Or is this a quality issue –
    existing laws are flawed or are not properly enforced?

    > “From early reporting, we understand there may be some mental issues with
    this shooting. So, the question is, “Are those laws where they need to be?”

    ==================


    “.@SpeakerRyan, there are any number of ways we could anticipate & prevent
    gun violence. There is no doubt in my mind that if legislation to expand
    background checks came to a vote, it would pass with bipartisan support.
    #EnoughIsEnough”

    “Another shooting in our schools, today at Stoneman Douglas High School in
    Parkland, Florida. Yes, our children are resilient, but this is not a burden
    they should ever have to bear. My heart aches for these children & their
    families. #StopGunViolence”


    Senator Chuck Schumer, (D-NY) Twitter, Feb 14, 2018
