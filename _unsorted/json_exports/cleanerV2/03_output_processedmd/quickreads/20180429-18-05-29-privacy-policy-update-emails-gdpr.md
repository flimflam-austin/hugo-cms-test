    EU Privacy Protections

    ----------------------


    Last week, a new law, the **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR),
    went into effect in the EU.


    It requires every company that sells goods or services to EU residents to
    UPDATE their privacy polices \*and\* clearly describe (in plain English) how
    they COLLECT & USE personal data, like your name, age, location, gender,
    birthday, or marital status.

    You don’t live in the EU, so why are you getting the privacy updates?

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------


    The GDPR applies globally to all companies that collect data from EU
    residents **regardless of whether they are located** in Silicon Valley or
    across the Atlantic Ocean.


    Those that fail to comply risk a fine of up to 4% of their annual revenue or
    20M euros (**whichever is higher**).

    The GDPR aims to improve privacy protections, but some experts are
    skeptical, noting that most people won't even read (yet alone understand)
    the updated privacy notices providing them more control over their personal
    data. Read more about the GDPR here:
