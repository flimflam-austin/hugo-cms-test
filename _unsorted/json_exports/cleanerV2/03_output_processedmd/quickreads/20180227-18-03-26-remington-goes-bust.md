    To Blame? “Trump Slump”

    -----------------------


    *   Prior to election of President Trump, gun sales spiked because those who
    expected Hillary Clinton to win (with a platform of stricter gun control)
    bought weapons in advance of election.

    *   With gun control NOT a big part of President Trump’s platform, buyers
    are less motivated.

Other gun makers have their own model numbers for similar style weapons.A **Though often used as a general term, an a\x1CARa\x1D is a specific gun by a specific company.A**"
