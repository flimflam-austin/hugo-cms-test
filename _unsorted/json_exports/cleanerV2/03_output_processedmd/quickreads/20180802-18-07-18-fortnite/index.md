    What Is Fortnite Anyway?

    ------------------------


    *   Online brawl where 100 players leap out of a plane on to an island &
    fight until 1 person is left.

    *   Hidden around the island are weapons & defense items.

    *   As game goes on, playable area shrinks; forcing players closer.

    *   Last survivor is the winner.

    *   Epic Games just released Season 5.

    Heard of Flossing?  

    (And, no, not your teeth.)

    -----------------------------------------------


    *   2018’s go-to dance move is all thanks to Fortnite.

    *   During Fortnite, players can bust some dance moves to taunt an opponent,
    celebrate, or for fun.

    *   To floss, you swing your hips frantically in the opposite direction of
    your arms & back again.
