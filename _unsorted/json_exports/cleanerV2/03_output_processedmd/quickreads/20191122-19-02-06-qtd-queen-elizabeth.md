    Bag Lady?

    ---------


    The Queen is rarely seen without a handbag and it’s usually her signature
    black Launer bag (a British designer), in which she’s been known to carry
    her reading glasses, lipstick, and a handkerchief.


    **One item not in her purse?  

    **A passport; she doesn’t need one! (because they are issued in her name).

    Although she is the world's longest (living) monarch, she is not *yet* the
    longest reigning monarch - that title goes to the former King of Swaziland,
    who spent 82 years on the throne after ascending to the thrown at age 1.
