    Why This Matters?

    =================


    Heel Designs May Change

    -----------------------


    *   In 2012, Louboutin sued a Netherlands shoe company to prevent it from
    producing red-soled shoes, citing its EU trademark.

    *   Now, EU court adviser says Louboutin’s EU trademark might be invalid. A
    ruling is expected shortly.

    Red Sole Battle In U.S.

    =======================


    *   In 2012, a NY federal appeals court ruled Louboutin’s U.S. trademark on
    red-soled shoes was valid, EXCEPT when the shoe itself is red too – meaning
    the trademark doesn’t apply to red monochromatic shoes (i.e. Dorothy’s red
    slippers in The Wizard of Oz).
