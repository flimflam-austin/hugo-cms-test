    Do You Share Brainwaves?  

    Study Says “Yes”

    -------------------------------------------


    > “The current results suggest that friends are **exceptionally similar** to
    one another in terms of how they perceive, interpret, and react to the world
    around them…data also demonstrate(s) that it is possible to predict whether
    or not two individuals are friends.”

    Small Study But Significant

    ---------------------------


    *   An **entire class of grad students** (279) answered questions on
    friendships within group.

    *   **42 agreed to brain scans** & watched unique videos to produce range of
    emotions.

    *   Researchers charted brain activity and **could predict who were
    friends** based on results; “friendly” brains reacted similarly to images.
