    Important Context:

    ------------------


    *   It’s not just the total # of cases the CDC is concerned about…it’s the
    **TYPE of diseases**.

    *   **9 NEW germs** from mosquitoes, fleas and ticks discovered.

    *   Disease cases from ticks = doubled. **7 new “tick” germs**.

    *   **DRAMATIC increase in 2016** (due to Zika).

    *   Chikungunya and Zika outbreaks in U.S. for first time.
