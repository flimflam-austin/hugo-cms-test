    Infrastructure Plan: WH  


    --------------------------


    *   Official plan revealed Monday.

    *   Cost Estimate: $1.5 trillion

    *   Big News? Will reportedly change infrastructure funding so permit
    approval is faster but funding is more state-driven.

    *   Critics: More burden on states will mean more toll roads/fees for
    citizens & state’s needing controversial private investment (some
    like/dislike).
