    Dolly’s Library:

    ----------------


    *   Dolly’s dedication to children’s literacy was inspired by her dad, who
    never learned to read or write.

    *   In 1995, Dolly founded the _Imagination Library_ in Tennessee.

    *   To date, the _Imagination Library_ has mailed more than 100 million free
    books to children in participating communities in US, UK, Canada &
    Australia.

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    *   From 2011 to 2016, America’s average reading score ranking among 4th
    graders dropped from 5th in the world to 13th.

    *   Reading to kids at home is #1 key to improving early childhood literacy.

    *   Kids from families with incomes below the poverty line are less likely
    to be read aloud to than those from higher income families.

    Can't get enough Dolly? Us either! We're in luck because she just announced
    a remake of the 1980 comedy classic "9-5"!
