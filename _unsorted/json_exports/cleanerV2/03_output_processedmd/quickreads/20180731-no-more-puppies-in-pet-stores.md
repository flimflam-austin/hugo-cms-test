    England’s Proposed Ban

    ----------------------


    *   **What**: Ban sales of puppies & kittens younger than 6 months old by
    anyone EXCEPT breeders.

    *   **Why**:A Crackdown on puppy mills & poor treatment of animals.

    *   **Interesting**: England doesn’t track puppy sales – no clear idea of
    how many puppies are actually being sold through pet stores; estimates
    upwards of 80,000.

    Puppy Probs: Stateside

    ----------------------


    *   Americans spending more $$ on their pet’s care & comfort: est. $70B this
    year.

    *   CA passed a law banning the sale of puppies in pet stores by 2019.

    *   MD passed a similar law this year.

    *   **Why keep pets in pet stores?** Some argue pushing all sales to
    breeders will push puppy sales “underground” and same mistreatment to occur.

    The Benefit Of A Ban

    --------------------


    > _“_(Bans) protect consumers who may unwittingly purchase sometimes sick or
    genetically compromised puppy mill puppies from pet stores. They promote the
    acquisition of shelter/rescue dogs instead of commercially bred dogs ….
    Nationally, they pressure the commercial pet industry to clean up its act.”

    The proposed ban of puppy and kitten sales in English pet stores opened for
    public commentary in late August and will close in mid-September before it
    goes before Parliament; a ban to stop sales of pets younger than 8 weeks old
    starts on Oct. 1.
