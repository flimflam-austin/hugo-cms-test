  card_text: "> “_Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it_.”\n\nSteve Jobs"

    Jobs, one of the most successful college dropouts ever, co-founded Apple in
    1976. Nearly thirty years later on January 9, 2007, Apple unveiled the
    iPhone. To date, Apple has sold about 1.5B iPhones. Despite previous
    success, Apple just cut its iPhone sales projections out of economic
    concerns.
