    How Do You Lose Your Hearing Anyway?

    ------------------------------------


    **Overexposure to loud sound** kills off tiny hair cells in your ear that
    transmit sound signals to your brain.


    Once damaged, these **cells don’t grow back** and you have hearing loss.


    **2 out of 3 people over age 70** have trouble hearing.

But earbuds and listening to music with earbuds are not a major cause of hearing loss.a\x1D\n> \n> Dr. Robert Dobie, clinical professor of otolaryngology at the University of Texas Health Science Center. One of Dr. Dobie's March 2017 studies found rates of hearing loss have actually fallen among adults aged 20-69."

    Stopping It Before It Starts

    ----------------------------


    *   **Wear both headphones.** We use both ears to gauge sound, with just one
    in, you tend to turn it up.

    *   Current MP3 players can’t be turned as loud as those in the 80s & 90s,
    but one audiologist warns newer ones might be worse because **more**A
    **people listen for longer periods of time.**

    *   **60/60 Rule:**A volume at less than 60% with breaks every 60 mins.

    Not Your Grandpa’s Hearing Aid

    ------------------------------


    Hearing aids have gone high-tech now answering phone calls & calculating
    user’s steps.


    Costing approx. $3-5K & rarely covered by insurance, only 20% of those over
    70 wear one.


    New law allows over-the-counter hearing aids by 2020 for just $80.

    Which headphones are safest? Experts recommend noise-canceling ones,
    especially in loud places. You're less apt to crank up music to drown out
    background noise, but experts warn they're not a good option when you need
    to hear outdoor sounds - like when running.
