    > “**It represents something**. It represents something very important to
    this country. People never thought a thing like this could happen and it
    can. People never thought you were going to have a situation where we’re
    having serious & positive communication with North Korea and we are. What
    happens? Who knows? We have a chance at something really great for the
    world.”
