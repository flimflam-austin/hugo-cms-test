    ---------------------


    **“Best if used by”:** refers to quality, not safety. Recommended for
    flavor.


    **“Use by”:**A date on products that could become less safe as they age.


    **“Sell by”:**A tells the store how long to display. Issue is quality not
    spoilage.


    **“Expiration Date”:**A last day to eat. Proceed at your own risk.
