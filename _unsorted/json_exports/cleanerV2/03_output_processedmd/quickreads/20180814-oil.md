    Don’t Mess with Texas

    =====================


    *   U.S. produces 11M barrels oil per day – more than any country in the
    world for **1stA time since 1973**.

    *   Texas is responsible for **one-fifth of U.S. production**A due to shale
    drilling boom.

    *   **Texas is now on track to produce more oil than Iraq & Iran;**A Mideast
    instability has impacted that region’s oil markets.

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   More production at home makes the U.S. less reliant on volatile Middle
    East, creating more jobs for production & distribution.

    *   Also important to remember: **Oil is a global market.** If Saudi Arabia
    or Russia ramped up production dramatically, it could drive prices lower –
    potentially to a point that would make extracting oil from shale not worth
    it financially.

    this pace or slightly higher, allowing it to remain the world's #1 oil
    producer through 2019.
