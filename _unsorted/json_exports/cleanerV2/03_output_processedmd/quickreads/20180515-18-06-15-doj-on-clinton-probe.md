    WHY IT MATTERS:

    ---------------


    18-month investigation reveals how entangled FBI was in 2016 election.


    ConservativesA challenged the FBI’s trustworthiness, letting Clinton off the
    hook & Liberals blamed the bureau for mishandling the Clinton probe, costing
    her the election.


    **Bottom line:** Watchdog’s findings give neither side total vindication.

    charges against Comey, but it gave both Democrats and Republicans plenty of
    ammunition to criticize him & the FBI. Click for what they are saying.
