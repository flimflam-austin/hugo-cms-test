    Pres. Lincoln’s “Support”

    -------------------------


    *   **Catafalque:** a frame that supports a coffin (cat-e-falk).

    *   Pres. Lincoln’s catafalque from 1865 has held most of the coffins that
    have lain in state.

    *   The catafalque has had minor restorations since 1865 (retrofitted to
    hold larger coffins, drapery replaced), but for the most part, it remains
    like the original.

  card_text: "“In State” vs. “In Honor”\n-------------------------\n\nAverage citizens cannot **“lay in state”** as that honor is reserved for_**gov’t & military** officials.\n\nHowever, **eminent private citizens** may **“lay in honor.”**\n\nTo date, only four have received the honor, including Rev. Billy Graham & two police officers killed during an attack on the U.S. Capitol."
