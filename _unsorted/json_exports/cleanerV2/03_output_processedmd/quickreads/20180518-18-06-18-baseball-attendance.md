    WHAT’S TO BLAME?  

    MLB is Trying to Find Out

    --------------------------------------------


    *   **Cost?** Avg ticket price in MLB is $32, but on the re-sale market
    (i.e. StubHub) it’s $76. Add food & drinks, that’s approx $100 for 1 fan.

    *   **Less Competition?A** Handful of really good teams & really bad teams
    makes for less thrill. Strikeouts topped hits in April.

    *   **No incentive?** Fans can watch anywhere – phone, tablet, TV.

    WHY THIS MATTERS

    ----------------


    *   **MLB attendance is pretty consistent**, swinging no more than 2% in
    either direction.

    *   Baseball hasn’t seen a **drop like this since 1995** following a player
    strike which canceled the World Series.

    *   Empty stadiums may give you a better shot at catching a foul ball, but
    **not an ideal setting to watch a game.**
