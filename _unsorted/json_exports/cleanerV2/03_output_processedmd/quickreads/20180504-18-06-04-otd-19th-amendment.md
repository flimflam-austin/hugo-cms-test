    Why did it take so long?

    ------------------------


    > In 1919, 41 years after it was first introduced, Congress passed the 19th
    Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote.

    > 

    > 1 year, 2 months & 2 weeks later, the necessary three-fourths of the
    states ratified the 19th Amendment.

    > 

    > On Aug 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state to ratify.
