    “Denuclearization”

    ------------------


    The White House wants North Korea to agree to “denuclearization.”


    *   Definition: “Total. Full. Complete” removal of all nuclear weapons in
    North Korea (Sec. of State Mike Pompeo).

    *   National Security Advisor John Bolton mentioned a “Libya-model”
    denuclearization – this sparked trouble in NoKo.

    Quick Catch-Up: Libya

    ---------------------


    *   Libya negotiated “denuclearization” in 2003 in return for $anctions
    relief.

    *   Libyan regime collapsed during Arab Spring (2011); unrelated to nuke
    deal but U.S. had an active role (w/NATO) forcing regime out.

    *   NoKo: Libya’s fate show why NoKo NEEDS nukes – for security, leverage
    and to keep America from meddling in its affairs.

    Debate: Denuclearization

    ------------------------


    *   NoKo views Bolton’s comments as “an awfully sinister move to impose on
    our dignified state the destiny of Libya…”

    *   Could “denuclearization” for North Korea mean no nukes on **ENTIRE
    KOREAN PENINSULA**? The U.S. doesn’t have nukes in South Korea but a key
    military base. Could that change?A **Is that a non-starter for the summit?**

    SmartHER Tip: Watch what's going on with China (NoKo trade partner). The
    U.S. said it's putting "the trade war on China (tariffs) on hold" after
    positive talks. We don't know all the details, but we're watching the
    timing...
