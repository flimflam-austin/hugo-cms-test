    Monday: KOKITO

    --------------


    During a flight from Houston to New York, a flight attendant ordered the
    owner of a french bulldog named Kokito to put the puppy in its carrier in
    the overhead compartment.


    The family said they heard Kokito barking for two hours, but when the plane
    landed, Kokito was dead.

    United’s Response:

    ------------------


    “We have learned that the customer did tell the flight attendant that there
    was a dog in the carrier. However, our flight attendant did not hear or
    understand her, and did not knowingly place the dog in the overhead bin. As
    we stated, we take full responsibility and are deeply sorry for this tragic
    accident.”

    United announced it will implement a new policy: "To prevent this from
    happening again, by April we will issue bright colored bag tags to customers
    traveling with in-cabin pets. This visual tag will further help our flight
    attendants identify pets in-cabin."
