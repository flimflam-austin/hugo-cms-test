    Key Takeaways

    =============


    *   **ISIS**: Losing “physical caliphate” but pressure needs to continue.

    *   **Iran**: Moving dangerous missiles around the Middle East to places
    like **Yemen**.

    *   **Russia**: Major mischief maker, undermining efforts inside **Syria**.

    *   Something to watch: **China’s** growing presence in Middle East, such as
    a port in **Pakistan** and military base in **Djibouti** (Africa).

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    *   CentCom’s focus on Iran, despite all the major players, serves as a
    reminder of Iran’s powerful role as an anti-American state sponsor of
    terror.

    *   The Middle East impacts our national security, not only because of
    terrorism threat, but also economically (oil markets, shipping lanes,
    investment of military “men & materials”).

    SmartHER News quotes the "open" session available to the public; General
    Votel also testified in a classified setting not open to the press. This is
    normal practice, but important to mention.
