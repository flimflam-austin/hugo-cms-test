**The singular Oprah Winfrey on braving the elements, the way forward for women, and why, for now at least, she doesn”t want to be president**

**byA LAURA BROWN**

OW:A \[Laughs\] I actually saw a mug the other daya\\t…a\\tI thought it was a cute mug. All you need is a mug and some campaign literature and a T-shirt. I”ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not. And so it”s not something that interests me. I don”t have the DNA for it. Gayle—who knows me as well as I know myself practically—has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, When”s Oprah going to run? So Gayle sends me these things, and then she”ll go, I know, I know, I know! It wouldn”t be good for you—it would be good for everyone else. I met with someone the other day who said that they would help me with a campaign. That”s not for me.
