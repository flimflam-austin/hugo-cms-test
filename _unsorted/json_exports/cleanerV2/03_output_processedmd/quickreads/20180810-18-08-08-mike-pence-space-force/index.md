    ------------------


    *   VP detailed concerns of other nations “weaponizing space” with efforts
    to develop satellite-killing rockets, citing threats from Russia & China.

    > “There is a threat out there, but it is being handled by the U.S. Air
    Force today. It doesn’t make sense to build a whole other level of
    bureaucracy in an already bureaucratic DOD (Department of Defense).”

    of space shuttle Endeavor, referencing the Air Force Space Command at

    Something to Consider

    ---------------------


    President Trump cannot create a Space Force without Congressional approval.


    VP mentioned the request for funding will come in the President’s next
    budget (unveiled in February).


    **Remember:** Congress controls purse strings & allocating taxpayer money.

    “When _you think about the history of this, people have forever believed that space was a sanctuary and it is not. It is becoming more contested, more congested and more competitive than ever before. And in order to preserve space, we have to be willing to defend it.” -A NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine_
