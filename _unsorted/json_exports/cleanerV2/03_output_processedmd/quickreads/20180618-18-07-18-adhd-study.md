    way.

    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    *   American Medical Association: teens watching videos, texting, posting,
    etc. more than 14x a day, showed **higher rates of ADHD** symptoms over
    two-year period.

    *   However, researchers **fell short** of PROVING cause and effect.

    *   Lingering Question: Can tech use **cause** ADHD, or do ADHD sufferers
    enjoy the stimulation of tech more than others?

    ADHD: Defined

    =============


    > “Symptoms of ADHD include **inattention** (not being able to keep focus),
    **hyperactivity** (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and
    **impulsivity** (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought).”

    Bigger Picture

    --------------


    *   No one knows the cause of ADHD.

    *   Diagnosis rates have gone up (more than 40% between 2003 – 2011) though
    there’s some disagreement on total numbers.

    *   Most diagnoses occur at a young age – around 6.

    *   1 out of 3 children with ADHD will retain diagnosis as adults.

    *   Treatment = therapy & medication.
