2.  Most of the world may be experiencing unseasonably warm weather this winter a\\u0014 but the forecasts tellA a very different story for Pyeongchang, South Korea, where temperatures could be as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit on the night of the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.[http://theweek.com/speedreads/752019/2018-winter-olympics-could-coldest-record](\"http://theweek.com/speedreads/752019/2018-winter-olympics-could-coldest-record\")
3.  The games, which begin Thursday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, will easily be the coldest since the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.

4.  **Exclusive: Ralph Lauren’s Olympic opening ceremony uniforms are wearable mini-heaters.** Call it the coolest heating system ever, says a proud David Lauren, son of Ralph and chief innovation officer for Ralph Lauren Corp., chief outfitter for the U.S. Olympic Committee since 2008. “It’s the most technologically advanced jacket ever produced,” Lauren says. “There have been heatable blankets for kids before but they have wires. This is a fabric with ink that heats up a\\u0014A it’s weightless, it’s conductive and it’s immediate.”[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/22/exclusive-ralph-laurens-olympic-opening-ceremony-uniforms-wearable-mini-heaters/1045189001/](\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/22/exclusive-ralph-laurens-olympic-opening-ceremony-uniforms-wearable-mini-heaters/1045189001/\")
5.  **Also a good read:A THIS PARKA KEEPS OLYMPIANS TOASTY WITH HEAT-CONDUCTING INK**A The heated jacket works almost like an electric blanketa\\u0014except instead of wires or coils sewn into the fabric, the heat comes through a special type of carbon and silver ink bonded to the jacket lining. (In true patriotic fashion, Ralph Lauren applied the ink in the shape of an American flag.) The ink conducts heat in the same way a wire would, and connects to a small battery pack sewn into the garment. When fully charged, the jacket itself stores up to 11 hours of heating time. Athletes can adjust the temperature up or down through a smartphone app; designers stress-tested the jacket inside of meat lockers to ensure that, on the highest setting, it could withstand temperatures as cold as 20 below zero.A [https://www.wired.com/story/ralph-lauren-conductive-heat-ink-parka/](\"https://www.wired.com/story/ralph-lauren-conductive-heat-ink-parka/\")
