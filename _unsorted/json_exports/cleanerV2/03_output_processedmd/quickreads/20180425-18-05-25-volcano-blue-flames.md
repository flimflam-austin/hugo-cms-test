    Wait… BLUE Flames?

    ------------------


    When the lava buries plants, methane gas is produced. Methane can seep into
    the ground & produces a blue flame when ignited.


    The blue flames are only visible at night, making it hard to judge how
    widespread they are.


    Scientists are now concerned the methane may cause explosions.
