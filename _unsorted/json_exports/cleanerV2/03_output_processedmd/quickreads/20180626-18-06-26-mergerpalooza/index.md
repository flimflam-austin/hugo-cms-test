    Get Me Up to Speed

    ------------------


    *   Last year, Disney offered $52B for a big stake in 21st Century Fox.

    *   Then Comcast decided to get in on the action, offering $65B.

    *   Disney isn’t having that & just last week raised its offer to $71B,
    which Fox says is a superior bid.

    *   Ball is now in Comcast’s court: will it up the stakes even more?


    Oh the drama...

    $71B?! Why So Much?

    -------------------


    *   **What Disney & Comcast want:** Fox’s stake in Hulu (streaming service)
    & Hollywood studios with TV & film franchises (Think: X-men & The Simpsons).

    *   **Bottom line:**A Real driver is the fear of the future with digital
    rivals like Amazon, Facebook & Netflix disrupting content, advertising &
    distribution. Media cos. need to get in the game to compete.
