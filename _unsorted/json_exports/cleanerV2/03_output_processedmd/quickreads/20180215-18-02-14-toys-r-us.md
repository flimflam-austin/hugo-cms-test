    Why This Matters

    ================


    U.S. Toy Industry = $27B

    ------------------------


    *   Toys ‘R’ Us = **2nd largest** U.S. toy retailer, represents **15% of
    sales**.

    *   But, you guessed it, **Amazon is #1** as more shop online.

    *   Lesson in debt: Toys ‘R’ Us had billions in debt – couldn’t invest in
    changes to help it modernize.

    *   Major fallout for Mattel, Hasbro & smaller toy makers.

    The American Dream:

    -------------------


    *   Toys ‘R’ Us founder Charles Lazarus dreamed of having a store of his own
    when he went to visit his dad’s bike shop.

    *   **1948:** When Lazarus returned from fighting in WWII, he opened a
    children’s furniture store in D.C., just as the Baby Boom began.

    *   **1950s:** Expanded to toys, built store to look like the cutting-edge
    “self-service” supermarkets.
