    Why “SmartHER News”?

    --------------------


    *   Developed by journalist Jenna Lee Babin.

    *   SmartHER sounds a lot like “smarter” – how solid journalism should make
    us feel.

    *   We believe American journalism provides a crucial public service.

    *   We want to provide the best customer service experience available in
    news delivery.

    Why A Card Flip?

    ================


    *   The card flip is inspired by traditional reporter’s notebooks; spiral
    bound note pads flipped pages upward.

    *   Symbolically, we want to return journalism to what it once was – a solid
    news service – a public service that informs & reports.

    Why The Sunglass Logo?

    ----------------------


    We believe everyone should have different styles…different ways of looking
    at the world…and different perspectives – That’s what America is all about!


    But we should all be able to see the facts clearly.


    And that’s what SmartHER News is all about!
