    Speaker of the House

    ====================


    Why It Matters:

    ---------------


    The leader of the House of Representatives supervises administrative duties
    within the House and serves as the top representative of elected officials
    (aka congressmen/women) nationally & especially, before the President.

    History

    -------


    *   **Mandated by Constitution** (but no official rules on HOW a Speaker
    should be elected).

    *   Modeled after British House of Commons. The Speaker kept order over
    elected officials representing the “Average Joes.” Speaker spoke for the
    monarchy within the Commons…while ALSO speaking for elected officials before
    the monarchy.

    Will Republicans Lose Majority In The House?

    --------------------------------------------


    *   Speaker Ryan joins **40 other Republicans not seeking re-election** Nov
    2018; Dems need to win 23 seats for the majority.

    *   Speaker Ryan could’ve run for re-election, win & then retire – securing
    a Republican seat. Ryan said he just couldn’t lie to his constituents about
    his intent.

    So who will be the next Speaker of the House? You could be! Why? Because the
    Speaker doesn't have to be an elected official, even though he/she's always
    been one.
