    Digital DIY Gunmaking

    =====================


    > Starting **August 1st**, a blueprint for how to build the first fully
    3D-printed gun (and others) can legally appear online.

    > 

    > Why some worry about a **new threat to pubic safety**, while others say
    this is a **non-issue**.

    What’s the Backstory?

    ---------------------


    *   In 2015, Cody WilsonA sued after gov’t ordered him to remove online
    blueprints for “The Liberator,” the world’s first fully 3D-printable gun.

    *   Gov’t said blueprints violated export laws, a nat’l security threat.

    *   Wilson argued his 1st & 2nd amendment rights (free speech & bear arms)
    were violated & won.

    *   Settlement reached in June.

    What This Means:

    ----------------


    *   Legal settlement allows Wilson to post his blueprints online; blueprints
    instruct how to print parts to build the gun.

    *   Blueprints includeA **single-shot pistol**A toA **AR-15
    semiautomatic.A**

    *   3D-printed guns**A untraceable**A (no system in place to assign serial
    numbers to 3D-printed firearms)A & therefore, owner **not subject to
    background checks.**

    What is the TRUE threat?

    ------------------------


    *   **No known crimes committed by 3D-printed guns** & questionable
    efficiency; some say 3D-printed guns will explode in user’s face after one
    shot. Critics argue technology will get better & less expensive

    *   **COST:**A 3D Printers cost**A $5K – $600K.**A A standard gun costs
    **only a few**A **hundred of dollars**.

    What's next? Philadelphia was the 1st city to ban 3D gun printing now others
    are rushing to follow suit. Gun control advocates attempted to block the
    blueprints from being released, but did not succeed. Read more on our source

    _There are some ideas for containing the risk. One measurea\\u0014which passed in California and took effect there this montha\\u0014would require anyone who makes a gun at home to register it and apply for a state-issued serial number. The Californian law also bans the sale or trade of homemade guns. But enacting a law and enforcing it are separate matters. Arrests for non-compliance are likely only after an untraceable gun is used to commit a crime. And with some 300m firearms in America, skirting the rules to acquire a gun is not difficult, regardless of how it was made. As one gun-control expert put it, a\\u001cIta\\u0019s a hell of regulatory challenge._a\\u001d
