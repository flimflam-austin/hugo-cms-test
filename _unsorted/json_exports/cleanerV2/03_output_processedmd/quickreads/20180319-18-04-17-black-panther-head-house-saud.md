    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   Saudi Arabia may allow American movies, orA partner w/U.S. in certain
    areas of foreign policy, but its **not a democracy**.

    *   Saudi Arabia home to 2 holiest sites in Islam – important to entire
    Muslim world – millions make pilgrimages to sites.

    *   Other Muslim nations like Bahrain and United Arab Emirates *already*
    show movies.

    So Why Outlaw Movies?

    ---------------------


    *   Saudi Arabia outlawed movies in 1979 because of a strict adherence to
    conservative Islam.

    *   Saudi Arabia is still an Islamic monarchy.A Movies will undergo
    censorship of some sort – unclear how severe.

    *   Experts ask if “reforms” are real or simply superficial.
