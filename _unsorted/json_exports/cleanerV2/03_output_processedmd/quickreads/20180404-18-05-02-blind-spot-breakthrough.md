    Blind Spot Breakthrough?  

    Backup Cameras

    =========================================


    New federal rule will require all newly manufactured cars to come equipped
    with backup cameras to prevent backup related accidents.


    Each year “**backover crashes**” result in 200+ fatalities; more than 50%
    are kids under 5 & adults over 70.

Though his own life was short, my son Cameron inspired a regulation that will save the lives of countless others.”**\n> \n> Dr. Greg Gulbransen, a pediatrician who accidentally killed his 2-year-old son Cameron when he backed over him with his vehicle in 2002. His work led to \"Cameron Gulbransen Kids. Transportation Safety Act of 2007', which eventually led to this new rule."
