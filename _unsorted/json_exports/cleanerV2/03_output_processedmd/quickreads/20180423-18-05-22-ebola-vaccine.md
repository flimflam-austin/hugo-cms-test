    Why Ebola Is Dangerous

    ----------------------


    *   **Quick Killer:** **Very infectious – Not very contagious**. A small
    amount can make you fatally sick. But it’s actually difficult to spread.
    It’s not airborne, but it is spread through direct contact with bodily
    fluids, exposure to contaminated objects from an infected person, and by
    handling infected meat.

    *   Ebola killed**A 11,000+ inA Africa in 2014-2016**; 11 cases in U.S.
