    StrongA economy has demand for trucks outpacing supply of drivers.

    transport costs to us.

    *   **Slower Deliveries:**A Are your Amazon delivery taking longer? You’re
    not alone.

*   **America Trucking Association’s Truck driving shortage analysis (2017):**  
    [http://progressive1.acs. playstream.com/truckline/ progressive/ATAs%20Driver% 20Shortage%20Report%202017.pdf](\"http://progressive1.acs.)

> _Autonomous Trucks:A While we are still years away from truly driverless Class 8 trucks running on the highway as a normal part of the industry; driver-assist technologies in heavy-duty tractor trailers could eventually have a positive impact on the driver shortage by making the job less stressful, and the more sophisticated technology may also attract younger individuals to truck driving. Many years from now and well beyond the dates of this report, one could envision an environment when the longer, line-haul portion of truck freight movements are completed by autonomous trucks and local pick-up and delivery routes are completed by drivers. However, motor carriers should not count on this being an option for many years._
