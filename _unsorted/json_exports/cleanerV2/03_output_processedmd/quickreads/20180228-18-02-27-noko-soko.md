*   Long read, but worth it when you have time:A THEA EDUCATIONA OF KIM JONGa\\u0013UNA [https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-education-of-kim-jong-un/](\"https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-education-of-kim-jong-un/\")A _During the 1990s famine, in which as many as 2a\\u00133 million North Koreans died as a result of starvation and hunger-related illnesses, Kim was in Switzerland. His childhood was marked by luxury and leisure: vast estates with horses, swimming pools, bowling alleys, summers at the familya\\u0019s private resort, luxury vehicles adapted so that he could drive when he was 7 years old. For Kim, skiing in the Swiss Alps and swimming in the French Riviera must have seemed part of his birthright. Kim had a temper, hated to lose, and loved Hollywood movies and basketball player MichaelA Jordan.  
    __Fujimoto, the sushi chef, has described Jong-una\\u0019s mother as not very strict about education and says that he was never forced to study. His friend and classmate in Switzerland said of Kim: a\\u001cWe werena\\u0019t the dimmest kids in the class but neither were we the cleverest. We were always in the second tier a| The teachers would see him struggling ashamedly and then move on. They left him in peace.a\\u001d Jong-un was apparently unbothered by his less-than stellar scores; as his classmate noted, a\\u001cHe left without getting any exam results at all. He was much more interested in football and basketball thanA lessons.a\\u001d_
