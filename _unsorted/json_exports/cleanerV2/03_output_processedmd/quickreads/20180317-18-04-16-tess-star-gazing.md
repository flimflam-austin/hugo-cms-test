    MEET ‘TESS’

    -----------


    **T**ransiting **E**xoplanet **S**urvey **S**atellite


    (Lost you at “Exo”? Us too)


    TESS is a NASA spacecraft, roughly the size of a flying refrigerator,
    **expected to launch this week** on a crucial 2 year mission to quite
    literally scan the universe for stars.

    STAR SCANNER

    ------------


    *   TESS will fly a **2 yr mission**

    *   Goal: Scan 500,000 stars, incl **500 “earth-like” planets**.

    *   Think of it like taking a “census” of the universe.

    *   **Why?** Current telescopes can’t examine certain planets (they’re too
    far away); by charting stars & planet movements, TESS will help NASA decide
    where to prioritize further focus & exploration.

TESS missed the initial launch date of April 16 due to an issue with the Space X rocket it was hitching a ride on - will try again April 18th, 2018"
