    BOTTOM LINE:

    ------------


    *   As guilty pleas pile up, Mueller’s team has secured cooperation
    agreements with some former members of Trump’s team.

    *   None of the charges against those connected to Trump allege that they
    worked with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election.

    *   Mueller wants to interview Trump.

    *   The investigation is **ongoing** and changes day to day.
