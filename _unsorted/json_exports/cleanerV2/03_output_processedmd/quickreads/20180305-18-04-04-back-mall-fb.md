    Facebook’s Security Fix Impacts Instagram & Others

    way you shop & connect with friends. **But are you safer**?

    New From Facebook

    -----------------


    **87M** (not the estimated 50M) FB users had their private information
    shared with a third party without their permission.


    FB says you should assume your info has been “**scraped**” if you allowed
    people to search for you using your email or phone number. FB has now
    disabled that feature.

    Facebook Drama

    --------------


    *   Remember **FB** owns **Instagram** (and other HUGE social network
    companies like **WhatsApp**). This is why the security “fumble” is so
    significant.

    *   **Your user experience on FB or Insta may change.**A For example,
    accounts where you “like” a photo so you can shop the product have likely
    been altered until a full security assessment is completed.

    --------------------


    *   New study asked participants to stay off FB for 5 days.

    *   Participants’s stress hormone (cortisol) levels dropped, although they
    did not perceive themselves as LESS stressed.

    *   Participants felt less happy with their lives because of the “social
    disconnection.”

*   _Still, given the publica\\u0019s lack of understanding of APIs and platforms, it may be tough for Facebook to ever regain the trust broken by a month of savage headlines about the social networka\\u0019s privacy negligence. Long-term, this souring of opinion could make users hesitant to share as much on Facebook. But given its role as a ubiquitous utility for login with your identity across the web, our compulsive desire to scroll its feed and check its notifications, and the lack of viable social networking alternatives, Facebook might see the backlash blow over eventually.
