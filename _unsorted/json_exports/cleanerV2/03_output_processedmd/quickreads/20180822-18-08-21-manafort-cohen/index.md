    WHY IT MATTERS:

    ===============

    related to 2016 election.** Prosecutor said he _“worked to pay money to
    **silence two women** who had information that he believed would be
    detrimental to the 2016 campaign…”_

    > “Cohen … is more than happy to tell the Special Counsel all that he knows
    – not just about the obvious possibility of a conspiracy to collude and

    Pres. Trump called the Manafort trial a "witch hunt and disgrace." He has
    yet to speak publicly about Cohen's case. Meanwhile, the Special Counsel's
    investigation is entering its sixteenth month as WSJ reports of Russian
    hacking ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
