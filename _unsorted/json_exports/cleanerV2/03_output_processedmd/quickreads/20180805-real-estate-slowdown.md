    REALTY CHECK

    U.S. housing markets.** Is it the latest sign of a broader real estate
    slowdown?

    Why it Matters

    --------------


    The Great Recession was triggered largely by the U.S. housing bubble
    bursting in 2007 after years of lenders giving out risky mortgages.


    Our current lending environment has changed, but one property data company
    says “some loosening” of lending standards has put risk back into the
    market.

    Cause For Concern?

    ------------------


    *   **High Home Prices:** Median cost of U.S. homes was up 6.2% in June vs.
    last year – a lower gain from the previous month.

    *   **Rising Mortgage Rates:** 30-year fixed 4.5% vs. 4% at start of 2018.

    *   **Homebuilding Slows:A** hit a 9-month low in July and has yet to
    significantly rebound.

    *   **Fewer Foreign Buyers:** Overseas purchases down a record 21%.
