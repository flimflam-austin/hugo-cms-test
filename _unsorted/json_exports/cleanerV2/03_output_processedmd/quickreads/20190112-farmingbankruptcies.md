    Why Now?

    ========


    *   **Oversupply** of crops (at home & overseas) fuels lower prices.

    *   **High Debt** – Farmers currently carrying the highest debt in 4 decades
    (in part because of borrowing to cover several years of low crop prices).

    *   **Trade**: Tariffs (or taxes) on American grown crops exported to China
    or Mexico hurts farmers on top of the depressed prices.

    this week ahead of the March 2nd deal deadline for the two sides to set new
