    UAC 101

    -------


    *   When UAC arrive in U.S., they are transferred from the Dep’t of Homeland
    Security to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

    *   While their legal status is being sorted out, the ORR places most UAC
    with “sponsors” in the U.S.

    *   The sponsors are usually their parents or close family members.

    *   ORR periodically checks in to monitor their safety & well-being.

    their sponsors.

    *   86% participated in safety & well-being calls, but “**ORR was unable to
    determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 UAC**.”
