    Why It Matters

    --------------


    **Federal law prohibits states from removing voters from registration solely
    because of their failure to vote.**


    The Supreme Court said Ohio’s procedure does NOT violate the law because “it
    removes registrants only when they have failed to vote **and have failed to
    respond to a change-of-residence notice**.”

    Remember: Ohio is a swing state; it can swing republican or democrat in
    state/national elections. That's part of the reason why this case has
    heightened attention, as the voting rolls are HIGHLY important for both
    parties.
