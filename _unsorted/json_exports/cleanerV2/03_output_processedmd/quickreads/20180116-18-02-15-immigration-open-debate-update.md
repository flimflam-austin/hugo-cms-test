    Why It Matters:  

    March 5 DACA Deadline

    ---------------------------------------


    *   Trump says he will rescind DACA on March 5 without broader reform. DACA
    provides temporary legal status to those brought here illegally by parents.

    *   Pres. Trump open to allowing DACA recipients legal status or even
    citizenship in exchange for broader reform (ex: border wall $$$).

    Important To Note

    =================


    *   DACA deadline set by President Trump in doubt after two federal judges
    block WH move to rescind DACA.

    *   Trump administration asked Supreme Court to review the case.

    *   If Congress compromised on broader immigration reform, deadline & court
    cases might be irrelevant.
