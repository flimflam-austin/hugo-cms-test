    which he says refers to a product from a lactating animal. The FDA is
    reviewing the "public health consequences" of labeling different products
    "milk" when originally the term referred to only cow's milk.

    Why This Matters

    ----------------


    *   Big Picture: Americans drinking less dairy milk, while consumption of
    “alternative” milks (almond, coconut, oat, etc.) on the rise.

    *   The dairy industry says use of the term “milk” for other products
    misleads the public into believing alternatives provide the same nutritional
    value as cow milk, when they don’t; they want a new law “protecting” the
    milk label.

    > 

    > Michele Simon, Exec. Dir, Plant Based Foods Association, who wants to
    resolve this conflict in a "peaceful manner." The FDA has shown signs of
    empathy for the dairy industry, but enforcing any change to the language
    remains questionable.

    Laws DO exist to protect certain products, such as "bourbon" (whiskey
    produced in the United States in a particular way). Will that extend to
    cow's milk? Should it?
