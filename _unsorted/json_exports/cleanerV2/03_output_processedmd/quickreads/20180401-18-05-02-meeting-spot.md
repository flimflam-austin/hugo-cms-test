    FRONT RUNNER: DMZ

    =================


    **DMZ** =A demilitarized zone, a tensely guarded area dividing N. & S.
    Korea.


    **Pros:** Media facilities & equipment in place. Speculation Kim may not
    have a plane capable of going far.


    **Cons:** Too close to Kim’s turf? Pres. Trump may want a grander setting
    for 1st ever meeting btwn aA sitting U.S. President & N. Korean leader.

    OTHER CONTENDERS

    ----------------


    *   **Singapore:A** Has hosted high-level summits like this before. U.S. in
    favor, but N. Korea unlikely to support due to its relations.

    *   **Mongolia:** Closest & most neutral neighbor. Kim can travel there via
    train (which he prefers due to security concerns), although trip could take
    several days.

    *   **Longer shots:** Neutral European cities like **Geneva** orA **Oslo.**

    Millions watched Kim & S. Korea's President meet on Friday (1st meeting in
    more than a decade) at the DMZ. That has us wondering, why would N. Korea
    give up its nukes anyway? Check out one really interesting take here:
