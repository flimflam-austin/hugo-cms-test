    Syria: Did You Know?

    --------------------


    *   History of **secular rule** & tradition of religions living together
    including Christians & variety of Muslim denominations.

    *   **Educated public but struggling economy** – only about 1/4 land
    useable, low quality oil, high unemployment.

    *   Current population roughly the same as Pennsylvania: 13M (about 5M
    refugees dispersed).

    Tension Builds

    --------------


    *   Syria experienced droughts & dust storms 2006 – 2011. One expert
    compared this time to the “dust bowl” during America’s Great Depression.

    *   During roughly the same time period Syria’s relationship with America
    soured, U.S accused Syria of allowing transport of foreign fighters into
    Iraq to kill American soldiers.

    U.S. & Syria

    ------------


    *   Diplomatic relations began in 1944, but have gone “off-and-on” over the
    years for many reasons.

    *   U.S. listed Syria as State Sponsor of Terror since 1979. **America’s
    interest in Syria arguably lies in containing terrorism a long with Syria’s
    ally, Iran.**

    *   U.S. embassy in Syria closed 2012. U.S. forced closure of Syrian embassy
    in DC in 2014.

    Location Matters. Part of Syria's importance to America has less to do with
    Syria and more to do with the Middle East overall. We couldn't fit it all on
    one card...Check out "The Backstory" Syria: Iran & Russia"
