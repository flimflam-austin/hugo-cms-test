    Why Less Beer?

    --------------


    *   Craft beer competition (though that’s not making up for the shortfall in
    beer drinking completely).

    *   ‘Sex In The City’ effect: Hit TV show – the cast made cocktails
    (specifically cosmos) cool.

    *   Millenials drink less than older generation; choose drinks based on
    what’s perceived as healthier.

    BIGGER PICTURE

    ==============


    Big Brands Suffering

    --------------------


    Americans gravitating toward more local brands, perceived as healthier. It’s
    not just beer (although that’s part of it) – it’s big companies, like Bud,
    finding local competition.


    _“Brands such as Kellogg’s cereal, Campbell’s soup and Aunt Jemima pancake
    mix are all feeling the pinch”_ (WSJ)
