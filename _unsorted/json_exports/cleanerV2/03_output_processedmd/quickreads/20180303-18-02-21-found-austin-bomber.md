    --------------------

    others; cops questioning his roommates.

    *   Unclear if more pkg bombs exists.

    *   You might read he described himself as “conservative” ~ This happened in
    community college in 2012. As of this writing, no further insight on his
    political beliefs or if that motivated him.
