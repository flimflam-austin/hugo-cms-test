    Why Marriage?

    -------------


    Results same for married vs single, divorced OR widowed.


    *   Security: Married people may seek medical help sooner (they have someone
    around to nag them to go to the doctors OR to see changes in behavior).

    *   Economic: Couples may have better joint income & therefore, better
    healthcare.
