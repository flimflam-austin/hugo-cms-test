    Why This Matters:

    -----------------


    **Big issue for the court is whether the banA is constitutional**A (as
    applied to the 6 predominately Muslim countries – not North Korea &
    Venezuela) **specifically**:


    *   ******Did the President exceed his authority over immigration by issuing
    the ban?******

    *   **Is this discrimination?**

    “_No prior president has attempted to implement a policy that so baldly
    exceeds the statutory limits on the president’s power to exclude, or so
    nakedly violates Congress’s bar on nationality-based discrimination in the
    issuance of immigrant visas_.”

    Although the Supreme Court won't issue its decision until late June, keep an
    ear out for the questions asked by the justices for an idea of how they
    *might* rule on some of the many issues at play:

In a recent article for the American Bar Association, Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean and Distinguished Professor of Law at UCLA, and one of the of countrya\\u0019s leading constitutional law experts, laid out the issues at the center of the case, why they matter, and their broader implications.

_“The underlying issues inA Trump v. HawaiiA are enormously important: Do the federal courts have authority to review presidential decisions barring immigration from specific countries? What is the presidenta\\u0019s powers to do this? What, if any, justifications are required? May such presidential orders discriminate based on religion, and if not, how is it determined if there is religious discrimination? And if all of this is not enough to make the case significant, it also may reveal the justicesa\\u0019 views on presidential power and immigration that could be relevant to other issues pending in the lower courts, such as President Trumpa\\u0019s repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the challenges to President Trumpa\\u0019s threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and states that do not cooperate with immigration officials.”_
