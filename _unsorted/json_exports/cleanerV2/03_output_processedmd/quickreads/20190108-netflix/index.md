    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   Attendance in movie theaters is down.A Netflix’s foray into movies still
    new, but will couch viewership compete with theaters?

    *   Film originally panned by movie critics.

    *   Earned “R-rating” in theater, but no constraints in viewers’ homes.

    *   Many artists rebuff Netflix, wanting a widespread theater release. **Is
    this a game changer?**

    Netflix is eyeing the music industry, recently adding "Springsteen on
    Broadway" & Taylor Swift's "Reputation" concert to its offerings. Resale
    tickets cost $270 to as much as $40K/each; Netflix hopes not leaving your
    couch is incentive to sign up.
