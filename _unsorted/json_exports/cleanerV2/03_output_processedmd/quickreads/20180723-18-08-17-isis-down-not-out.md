    DOWN, BUT NOT OUT

    member is arrested in California**.


    Why It Matters

    The Big Picture

    ---------------


    > “**The U.S. doesn’t really know how many fighters ISIS has**, but it is
    clearly enough to continue launching daily attacks across Iraq and Syria,
    while also fighting in several other countries. **It is a mistake to think
    ISIS is defeated and the US needs to ensure it doesn’t mushroom once
    again**.”

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   **30,000:** UN & DOD estimate of ISIS fighters in Iraq & Syria alone

    *   Positive: America’s **military** **defeat** of ISIS, & the terrorist’s
    loss of territory in Syria.

    *   However, power of ISIS loyalty / ideology remains. “ISIS’ resilience”
    mentioned in both reports;A **$2B U.S. dollars** has gone to the Iraqi
    Security Forces to support fight vs. ISIS.

    Turkey, a NATO member, has both provided a gateway for ISIS fighters &
    suffered from ISIS terrorism. America planned to work w/Turkey vs. ISIS
    strongholds in Syria. As tension rise between U.S, & Turkey, the way forward
    remains uncertain & Russia lurks in the background.
