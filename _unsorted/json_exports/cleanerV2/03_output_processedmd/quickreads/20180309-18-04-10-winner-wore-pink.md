    The Winner Wore Pink…  

    HOT PINK

    --------------------------------


    > “I knew it was going to be a dogfight. It’s just a way of God basically
    saying, ‘Let’s see if you have it.'”

    > 

    > Golfer Patrick Reed, who sported a fluorescent pink Nike shirt on his
    quest for the iconic green jacket at The Masters Tournament.

    “Hyper Magenta”

    ===============


    New Marketing Strategy

    ----------------------


    *   According to WSJ, Nike decided sponsored golfers would wear the same hue
    during The Masters.

    *   That meant bitter rivals sported the same color shirt (or “hyper
    magenta” -A _Golf Week_) on the same day while battling for the
    championship.

    “Captain America”

    =================


    Patrick Reed

    ------------


    *   27-year-old married Texan.

    *   “Captain America” from his good performances at the Ryder Cup – a golf
    tournament every 2 years between U.S. & Europe.

    *   Idolizes Tiger Woods & dresses like him in a red shirt and black pants
    (why many took note of Reed’s deviated hot pink shirt).

    Why A Green Jacket?

    -------------------


    *   Green Jacket = official members jacket at the exclusive “August National
    Golf Club” since 1937.

    *   The Green Jacket awarded to tournament champion since 1949.

    *   Jackets ONLY for members or The Masters’ winner (for 1 yr only).

    *   The same Cincinnati tailor has made the famous jackets since 1967.

    Last year, Tiger Woods could barely walk. This year, he competed at The
