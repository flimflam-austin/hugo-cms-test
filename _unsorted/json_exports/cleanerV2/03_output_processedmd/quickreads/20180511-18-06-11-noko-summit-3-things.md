    What Does the U.S. Want?

    ------------------------


    *   N. Korea to **abandon its arsenal of nuclear weapons & ballistic
    missiles**, allowing in inspectors to confirm it is truly disarming.

    *   U.S. defense & intelligence say **N. Korea is close to being able to
    strike anywhere in the continental U.S.** with a nuclear-tipped missile,
    which Pres. Trump & other U.S. officials say they **wouldn’t tolerate.**

    What Does N. Korea Want?

    ------------------------


    *   Summit already seen as a win by N. Korea – **no sitting U.S. President
    has ever met with a N. Korean leader** (Presidents Carter & Clinton only
    visited after office).

    *   NoKo will likely demand **security assurances regime will not be
    overthrown or removed** if nukes are removed.

    *   Dropping of sanctions to allow more $$ in NoKo economy.

    What is Success?

    ----------------


    *   U.S. admin has had some successes already; Sec. of State Pompeo
    **secured release of 3 Americans** after meeting Kim Jong Un in May.

    *   Unclear if Pres Trump will declare anything less than complete
    denuclearization a success; he’s called it a **“mission of peace.”**

    It may be a sitting President's first time negotiating with North Korea, but
    not America's. Read the personal stories from those who've sat across the
    table, including tales of matching Kim Jong Un lapel pins and North Koreans
    quoting "Gone with the Wind."

    _Gallucci, then an assistant secretary of state, recalled that the Americans were taken aback by the sight of a dozen or so North Korean diplomats, each one with a lapel pin with a picture of their supreme leader.__a\\u001cYou can imagine us going into a meeting with lapel pins with Bill Clintona\\u0019s picture? Ita\\u0019s just implausible. But that actually goes to something thata\\u0019s quite important for people to understand,a\\u001d said Gallucci, describing North Korea as a cult of leadership as much as it is an authoritarian government.  
    __a\\u001cAnd one forgets that at onea\\u0019s peril. I think you can lose a lot of ground in discussion if you dona\\u0019t understand how sensitive they are about their leadership.  
    __“To the Americansa\\u0019 surprise, North Koreaa\\u0019s deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok Ju, during the talks quoted from the epic American civil war novel, a\\u001cGone with the Wind.a\\u001d It wasna\\u0019t the line immortalized by Clark Gable in the Hollywood movie a\\u0014 a\\u001cFrankly, my dear, I dona\\u0019t give a damn,a\\u001d Gallucci said, but rather a\\u001csomething to do with wagons rolling and dogs barking.a\\u001d After the meeting, he gave Kang a copy of the book as a gift. Gallucci got a box of Korean ginseng tea in return._
