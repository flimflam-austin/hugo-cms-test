    Cali-THREE-nia? Why?

    --------------------


    Man behind plan is famed investor Tim Draper with a history of making good
    bets. (Heard of Skype? Tesla?)


    He says plan will “simply divide the state into smaller, more manageable
    populations.”


    He’s been working on this for years. In 2014, he tried & failed to break up
    California into 6 different states.

    Making it happen would require not only approval by California voters but
    Congress. Click to learn just how long it has been since the U.S. added a
    state or split one up. (Hint: It's been awhile.)
