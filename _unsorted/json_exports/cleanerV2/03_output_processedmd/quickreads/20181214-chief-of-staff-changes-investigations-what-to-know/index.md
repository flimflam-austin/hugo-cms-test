    Why Timing Matters:

    -------------------


    > _“The high-profile hiring search comes at a pivotal time as the president
    looks to prepare his White House for the twin challenges of securing his

    House next year.”_

    Despite rampant rumors, no official reason was given for Kelly's upcoming
    departure. Widespread speculation aside, the Special Counsel has not
    directly implicated Pres. Trump in any crime or accused him of collusion.
    Investigation continues.
