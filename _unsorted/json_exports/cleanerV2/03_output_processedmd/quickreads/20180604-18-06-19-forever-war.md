    What’s the Controversy?

    Bush, Obama, & Trump to also fight _other_ terrorists around world.

    *   America’s war on terror now stretches to no less than 76 countries (39%
    of the planet).

    *   Lawmakers: time to take war off “autopilot.”

    incursions without consulting Congress on broader strategy.

    *   Critics say it flips Constitution, requires 2/3rds to _disapprove_ war.

    *   Fate unclear; Congress looks to avoid messy debate before midterms.
