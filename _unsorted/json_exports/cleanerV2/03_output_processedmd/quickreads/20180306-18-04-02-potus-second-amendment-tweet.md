    Why Now?

    --------


    *   Pres. Trump reacting to a NYT op-ed by former Supreme Court Justice who
    said he supports the repeal the 2nd Amendment.

    *   This fueled further fear by some Americans that gun confiscation and/or
    repeal of the 2ndA Amendment is the true intention of “gun control”
    movement.

    2 Possibilities: Both Tough

    --------------------------------------------------


    **Option 1:** Requires approval of a new by two-thirds of the House & Senate
    AND ratification (approval) by three-fourths of the 50 states.

    In our nation's history, only ONE amendment has ever been repealed. In 1933,
    the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the making,
    transportation and sale of alcohol, and put an end to Prohibition.
