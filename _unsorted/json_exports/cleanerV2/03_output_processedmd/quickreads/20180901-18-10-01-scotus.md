    COURT IN SESSION

    ================


    Today, the Supreme Court’s 8 justices begin hearing cases – WITHOUT Judge
    Brett Kavanaugh.


    It’s only the second time since 1864 the Court will start its new term with
    8 (instead of 9) justices.


    Why 9?

    WHY NINE?

    =========


    In 1790, the Supreme Court assembled for the **first time in NYC** (then our
    Nation’s Capital) with**A 6 justices**.


    From 1790 to 1869, Congress has changed the number of justices 6 times
    (requiring as many as 10 and as few as 5) until settling atA **9A
    justices**.

  card_text: "WHY “9” MATTERS:n================nn*   With only 8 justices, a 4-4 tie means the lower courtax19s ruling stands (as if the Supreme Court never heard the case).n*   **A 4-4 case can be reheard once a 9th justice is added**. In 2017, the Court reheard a 4-4 case it heard in 2016, and ruled 5-4 to strike down a vauge immigration law that made it easier to deport immigrants convicted of crimes."

    The first time in history the Supreme Court opened a new term with eight
    justices was in October 2016. After Justice Antonin Scalia's death earlier
    that year, the court operated with eight justices until Neil Gorsuch was
    confirmed in April 2017.
