    For Your Consideration

    ----------------------


    The latest 32-count indictment against Paul Manafort & Rick Gates accuses
    them of filing false tax returns, failing to file foreign bank accounts, and
    bank fraud – although the crimes they’re accused of are unrelated to their
    work for Trump, some took place around US election.

    BOTTOM LINE

    ===========


    Indictments & guilty pleas are speeding up.


    Some cases have serious potential jail time at stake; others will never see
    the inside of a courtroom.


    We don’t know when the investigation will end; there isn’t a timeline, but
    the pace of indictments indicates progress.
