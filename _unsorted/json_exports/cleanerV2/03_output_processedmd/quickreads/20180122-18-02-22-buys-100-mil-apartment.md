    Wall Street Journal Says:

    -------------------------


    *   Final Sale Price: **$100.47** **million**.

    *   Purchased in 2012 before construction on building finished.

    *   Despite the record-setting price, Michael Dell reportedly hired his
    architect to “renovate” the penthouse.

    *   Dell and others would NOT confirm ownership; WSJ reporting based on
    “sources.”

    -----------------------


    *   Existing Home Sales in U.S. for January = disappointment.

    *   Biggest year-over-year decline in 3 years.

    *   Existing home sales (homes already built) account for nearly 90% of the
    market.

    *   Low inventory leading to higher prices & slower sales.

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   Real estate market impacts overall economy; local & national.

    *   Moving, furnishing, decorating, replacing appliances, renovations etc.
    impact many industries.

    *   Recent data is a snapshot of **one** month, but this is why we pay
    attention – to see if slowing sales becomes a “trend.”
