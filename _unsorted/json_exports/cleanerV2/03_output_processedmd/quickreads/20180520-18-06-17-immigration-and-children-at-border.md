    reason. We need to fix our immigration laws, but using children is not the

    Watch For: Terms "parents" & "families" used in this debate. DHS says part
    of challenge of illegal immigration is "ascertaining parental relationship"
    for children. See inside a shelter for yourself:

    As the Trump administration argues, referring immigrants for prosecution is not new policy. But prior administrations did not enforce the practice the way Trump has.Before Trump came into office, families were detained together, sent back immediately or paroled into the country, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Now, prosecution is happening across the board and has become the uniform policy.”The policy has ramped up substantially with the new administration,” Margulies said. “Making that a staple of immigration policy is a new feature.”
