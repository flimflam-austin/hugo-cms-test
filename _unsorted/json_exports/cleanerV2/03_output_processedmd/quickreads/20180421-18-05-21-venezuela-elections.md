    More Oil Than Saudis, Why Are People Starving?

    ----------------------------------------------


    *   Venezuela’s oil is offshore or far underground, making it expensive to
    extract. It’s also less-desirable, harder-to-refine heavy crude.

    *   **Gov’t drove out foreign oil cos**. for control, oil output at a
    30-year low.

    *   In turn, gov’t printed more money, led to hyperinflation. Everything =
    expensive.

    tighter financial sanctions, including measures making it harder to export
    oil. That, coupled with new Iran sanctions, may spell higher oil prices for
    the world. Read more here.
