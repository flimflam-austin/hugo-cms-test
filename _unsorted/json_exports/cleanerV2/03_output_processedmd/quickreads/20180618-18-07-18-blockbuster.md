    The Ultimate Late Fee

    ---------------------


    Reed Hastings once said he **created Netflix** in 1997 out of **frustration
    over a $40 Blockbuster fine** after returning _Apollo 13_ late.


    At its peak **in 2004, Blockbuster had 9K stores**. Filed for **bankruptcy
    in 2010**.


    Today, **Netflix has 125M global subscribers.**

    The real kicker? Blockbuster's CEO passed on an opportunity to buy Netflix
    back in 2000 when it was just a DVD mailing company. The asking price? $50
    Million. Netflix is now worth $163 BILLION. Read more about the decision
    here.
