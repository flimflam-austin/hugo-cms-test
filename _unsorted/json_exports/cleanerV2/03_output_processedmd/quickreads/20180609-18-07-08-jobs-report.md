    Jobs Report 101

    ---------------


    *   You are counted as part of the labor force if you are **able** to work,
    **want** to work, and **actively** looking for work.

    *   More Americans started looking for work last month – a **good sign that
    reflects optimism**.

    *   The **labor force grew by 601,000 people**, reflecting more people
    looking for a job and the unemployment went up slightly.

    Something To Consider:

    ----------------------


    *   **Latino unemployment rate fell to a record low;** more women and blacks
    looking for work.

    *   **Wages continue to increase** – an important sign of healthy job
    market. However, when adjusted for inflation, the **take-home pay is
    essentially flat to last year**. Possible reason? More Americans fill lower
    paid jobs during summer months (AP).

    National vs. Local

    ------------------


    > While overall job picture positive, the numbers differ state-to-state.

    > 

    > CNBC: Some important swing states like Michigan have seen unemployment
    rates rise.

    > 

    > “The jobless rate was also higher than the national average in Arizona,
    Mississippi, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, all states Trump carried in 2016.”

    Don't forget the impact of potential aluminum & steel tariffs on
    Mexico/Canada/Europe for swing states like Michigan/Pennsylvania. A
    lingering question: What do the tariffs on China (and China tariffs on U.S.)
    do to the U.S.? economy & job market? More To Come.
