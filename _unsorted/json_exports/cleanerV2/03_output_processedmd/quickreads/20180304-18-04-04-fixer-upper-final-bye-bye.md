    ‘Fixer Upper’ Success

    =====================


    Talent & Good Timing

    --------------------


    *   Americans expected to spend more this year on home renovations (up 7.5%
    to more than $340 B) ~ due in part to rebuilding from terrible natural
    disasters.

    *   Sales on homes already built (ripe for remodel) up year-over-year.

    *   Overall, healthy real estate market.
