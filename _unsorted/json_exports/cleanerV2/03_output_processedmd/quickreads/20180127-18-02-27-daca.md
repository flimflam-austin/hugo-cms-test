    DACA Drama

    ==========


    *   Supreme Court will not hear an expedited legal appeal on DACA.

    *   Trump administration requested The Supremes look at case when lower
    courts halted President Trump’s unwinding of the program.

    *   DACA kicked back to lower courts. **Fate & timeline unknown.**

    **D**eferred **A**ction for **C**hildhood **A**rrivals:


    The 2012 Obama-era policy granted provisional work permits and temporary
    protection from deportation for nearly 800,000 young people brought to U.S.
    illegally as kids, but NO pathway to citizenship.

    How We Got Here:

    ----------------


    **Sept 2017:** President Trump announced repeal of DACA program & gave
    Congress until March 5th to come up with broader immigration reform.


    **January 2018:** California federal court issued a preliminary injunction
    halting repeal of DACA program & ordered gov’t to resume accepting DACA
    renewal applications.

    Why It Matters

    --------------


    *   Supreme Court’s decision not to hear appeal early says nothing about the
    merits of the case or how court might ultimately rule.

    *   DACA recipients can continue to apply for DACA renewals while the
    California case works its way through the court system.

    *   March 5th deadline is moot; Pres. Trump cannot cancel program during
    ongoing court challenges.
