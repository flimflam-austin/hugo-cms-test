    Why Tariffs Now?

    ----------------


    *   Commerce Dep’t warns cheap imports of steel & aluminum hurt nat’l
    security – i.e., not enough U.S. companies can competitively produce metal
    for our military.

    *   Pres. Trump campaigned on boosting jobs & growth in what he labeled a
    bedrock American industry (important in key states like Pennsylvania).

    Why Tariffs Matter:

    ===================


    Could Cost You $$  

    While Also Creating Jobs  


    -----------------------------------------------


    *   Positive for American companies that produce these products.

    *   Some fear retaliation from China & others – a possible “trade war” could
    mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on MANY products.

    *   Stock market reacted by falling sharply (down 586 pts at low).

    Tariff Deja Vu?

    ===============


    *   In 2002, Pres. Bush imposed aA **30% tariff** on steel imports.

    *   **Lasted only 20 months** after Europe responded with its own tariffs.

    *   World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled U.S. violated international trade
    agreements.

    *   **Difference this time**: Pres. Trump cites nat’l security provision
    that WTO typically doesn’t probe.

    Don't forget timing. Trump announced his campaign manager for 2020 this week
    (Pennsylvania crucial to his 2016 win) AND sanctions on North Korea,
    preventing shipments to China (a major metal producer).
