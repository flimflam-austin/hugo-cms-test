    “The Netflix of Fitness”

    ========================


    It’s a workout craze that’s got a cult-like following and has Wall Street
    working up a sweat, and investing a half a billion dollars.

    The Basics

    ----------


    *   Pronounced: Pel-**O**-t-**ON**.

    *   **Video-streaming stationary bike co**. launched in 2012.

    *   **The draw?** Get on the bike, turn on the screen & you can instantly
    take live or on-demand classes.

    *   **The catch?** Spin bicycle equipped w/22-inch touch-screen costs $1,995
    & need to pay $39/month for content on the screen.

    The Bigger Picture

    ------------------


    *   Peloton wants to make itself a public-traded company on Wall St. which
    says its **worth $4B+**.

    *   For perspective, that’s **more than Dick’s Sporting Goods** ($3.5B).

    *   CEO argues it’s a **“media company”** not just exercise equipment due to
    its **subscription-based model** (a la Netflix.)

    Reinventing the Wheel?

    ----------------------


    Exercise using a stationary bicycle is nothing new. In fact, first
    rudimentary version **created in 1796**.


    It wasn’t until the 1960s when **Schwinn released the “Exerciser”** that the
    bike exercise fad caught on.


    Today,A **stationary bikes are everywhere**, even the International Space
    Station.

    Peloton is taking pre-orders for a treadmill "Peloton Tread" with the same
    features. The CEO says he wants users who don't own a Peloton bike to access
    workouts on your phone & tablets. What do you think...exercise fad or does
    Peloton have staying power?
