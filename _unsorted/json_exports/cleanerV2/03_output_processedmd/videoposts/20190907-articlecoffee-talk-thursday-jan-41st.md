It is an ancient Mariner,  
And he stoppeth one of three.  
a\\u001cBy thy long grey beard and glittering eye,  
Now wherefore stoppa\\u0019st thou me?

a\\u001cThe Bridegrooma\\u0019s doors are opened wide,  
And I am next of kin;  
The guests are met, the feast is set:  
Maya\\u0019st hear the merry din.a\\u001d

He holds him with his skinny hand,  
a\\u001cThere was a ship,a\\u001d quoth he.  
a\\u001cHold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!a\\u001d  
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

He holds him with his glittering eyea\\u0014  
The Wedding-Guest stood still,  
And listens like a three years child:  
The Mariner hath his will.

The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:  
He cannot chuse but hear;  
And thus spake on that ancient man,  
The bright-eyed Mariner.

The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,  
Merrily did we drop  
Below the kirk, below the hill,  
Below the light-house top.

The Sun came up upon the left,  
Out of the sea came he!  
And he shone bright, and on the right  
Went down into the sea.

Higher and higher every day,  
Till over the mast at noona\\u0014  
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,  
For he heard the loud bassoon.

The bride hath paced into the hall,  
Red as a rose is she;  
Nodding their heads before her goes  
The merry minstrelsy.

The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,  
Yet he cannot chuse but hear;  
And thus spake on that ancient man,  
The bright-eyed Mariner.

And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he  
Was tyrannous and strong:  
He struck with his oa\\u0019ertaking wings,  
And chased south along.

With sloping masts and dipping prow,  
As who pursued with yell and blow  
Still treads the shadow of his foe  
And forward bends his head,  
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,  
And southward aye we fled.

And now there came both mist and snow,  
And it grew wondrous cold:  
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,  
As green as emerald.

And through the drifts the snowy clifts  
Did send a dismal sheen:  
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we kena\\u0014  
The ice was all between.

The ice was here, the ice was there,  
The ice was all around:  
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,  
Like noises in a swound!

At length did cross an Albatross:  
Thorough the fog it came;  
As if it had been a Christian soul,  
We hailed it in Goda\\u0019s name.

It ate the food it nea\\u0019er had eat,  
And round and round it flew.  
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;  
The helmsman steered us through!

And a good south wind sprung up behind;  
The Albatross did follow,  
And every day, for food or play,  
Came to the marinersa\\u0019 hollo!

In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,  
It perched for vespers nine;  
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,  
Glimmered the white Moon-shine.

a\\u001cGod save thee, ancient Mariner!  
From the fiends, that plague thee thus!a\\u0014  
Why looka\\u0019st thou so?a\\u001da\\u0014With my cross-bow  
I shot the ALBATROSS.
